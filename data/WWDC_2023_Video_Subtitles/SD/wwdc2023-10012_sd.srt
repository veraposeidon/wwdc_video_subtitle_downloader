Justin Thomas: Hi, everyone!


5
00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.346 line:-1 position:50%
My name
is Justin Thomas.


6
00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:14.214 line:-1 position:50%
I'm an engineer
on the App Store Connect team.

Maciej Kujalowicz: And I am
Maciej Kujalowicz,


8
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,017 line:-1
an engineer
on the TestFlight team.


9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,152 line:-1
Justin: Together, we will show
you how xrOS opens the door


10
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,955 line:-1
for you to create amazing
spatial experiences.


11
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,157 line:-1
And with a new App Store
on xrOS,


12
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:27,027 line:-1
users can discover and download
your incredible apps.


13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,829 line:-1
In this session,
I'll start by walking through


14
00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.898 line:-1 position:50%
all the different ways you can
make your apps available


15
00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:32.733 line:-1 position:50%
on xrOS.


16
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,035 line:-1
Then, Maciej will show you
everything you need to know


17
00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.738 line:-1 position:50%
about beta testing on xrOS.


18
00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:39.740 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, I'll help you make sure
that your app is ready


19
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.142 line:-1 position:50%
to be published
on the App Store.


20
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:45,412 line:-1
All right, so let's dive in
with setting up your app.


21
00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:47.848 line:-1 position:50%
In App Store Connect, you have
three options to choose from


22
00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.116 line:-1 position:50%
when setting up your app.


23
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,052 line:-1
You can create a new app
with the xrOS platform.


24
00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.321 line:-1 position:50%
This is the option to select
if you're introducing a new app


25
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:56.189 line:-1 position:50%
to the App Store
for the first time,


26
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,091 line:-1
or if you want to configure
your xrOS app


27
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,127 line:-1
to have a different
price or availability


28
00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:01.862 line:-1 position:50%
than your other apps.


29
00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.698 line:-1 position:50%
You can also add the xrOS
platform to an existing app


30
00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:06.500 line:-1 position:50%
to create a universal purchase.


31
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.202 line:-1 position:50%
This allows your users to enjoy
your app and in-app purchases


32
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,938 line:-1
across all platforms.


33
00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:14.708 line:-1 position:50%
Your app will have the same name
and URL across all platforms,


34
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,044 line:-1
making it easier
for users to find it.


35
00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:18.345 line:-1 position:50%
Your app will
automatically install


36
00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.013 line:-1 position:50%
for users across their devices
when they have


37
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,949 line:-1
automatic downloads enabled.


38
00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:24.985 line:-1 position:50%
And finally, you can choose
to make your compatible iPad


39
00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:27.788 line:-1 position:50%
and iPhone apps
available on xrOS


40
00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.924 line:-1 position:50%
without making any code changes
or submitting a new build.


41
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,227 line:-1
This is a great option if you're
still working on your xrOS app,


42
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,364 line:-1
but you want users on xrOS
devices to enjoy your app


43
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:39,166 line:-1
as soon as possible.


44
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,602 line:-1
OK, let's look at each of these
options in App Store Connect,


45
00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.671 line:-1 position:50%
starting with creating
a new app.


46
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,940 line:-1
Let's say I'm a developer
on the Nature Lab team,


47
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,309 line:-1
and I'm excited to create
a fully immersive app


48
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,877 line:-1
for my customers.


49
00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.747 line:-1 position:50%
I'm planning to introduce
Backyard Birds to the App Store.


50
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,849 line:-1
Since Backyard Birds
is a new app,


51
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,818 line:-1
I'll first need to create
a new app record.


52
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,486 line:-1
I can do this by clicking
the plus (+) button


53
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,855 line:-1
in the upper-left area
of the Apps page,


54
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:05,225 line:-1
and then selecting New App
from the drop-down menu.


55
00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.760 line:-1 position:50%
From the New App dialog,


56
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,229 line:-1
I'll select xrOS
under Platforms,


57
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.831 line:-1 position:50%
and then fill in
the remaining fields


58
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.501 line:-1 position:50%
like Name, Bundle ID, and SKU.


59
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:15.635 line:-1 position:50%
That's it!


60
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,038 line:-1
I'll just need to click Create
to complete the new app record


61
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:22,142 line:-1
for Backyard Birds, then I can
begin uploading builds.


62
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:26.413 line:-1 position:50%
Next, let's look at adding xrOS
to an existing app.


63
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,915 line:-1
I'm back on the Apps page
for my Nature Lab team.


64
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,117 line:-1
My customers love tracking


65
00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:31.651 line:-1 position:50%
their favorite
mountain climbing routes


66
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.754 line:-1 position:50%
with Mountain Climber on iOS,


67
00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:37.257 line:-1 position:50%
so I decided to introduce
a new experience on xrOS.


68
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,561 line:-1
To add the xrOS platform, I'll
select my Mountain Climber app.


69
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,897 line:-1
And from here,
I'll click Add Platform


70
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,365 line:-1
from the left sidebar.


71
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,802 line:-1
On the Add Platform dialog,
I'll just need to select xrOS,


72
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,604 line:-1
then click Add.


73
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,339 line:-1
Once the platform is added,


74
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,175 line:-1
I can then begin uploading
builds for Mountain Climber.


75
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.978 line:-1 position:50%
And finally, all compatible
iPad and iPhone apps


76
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:01,348 line:-1
are automatically made available
on the App Store on xrOS.


77
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,083 line:-1
If there's any reason
why you think your app


78
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,118 line:-1
doesn't make sense
on the platform,


79
00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.954 line:-1 position:50%
you can manage
its availability on xrOS.


80
00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.656 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a look.


81
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,792 line:-1
On the Apps page,
click the ellipsis (…) button


82
00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:13.360 line:-1 position:50%
in the upper-left area,


83
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.363 line:-1 position:50%
then select
"iOS Apps on xrOS Availability"


84
00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.398 line:-1 position:50%
from the drop-down menu.


85
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,600 line:-1
From here, you have full control
over managing which apps


86
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.836 line:-1 position:50%
are made available on xrOS.


87
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,405 line:-1
If your compatible iPad
and iPhone app is made available


88
00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:28.842 line:-1 position:50%
by using this option and
you later add the xrOS platform,


89
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,977 line:-1
releasing it will replace
the iOS app version


90
00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.379 line:-1 position:50%
on the App Store.


91
00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.247 line:-1 position:50%
For the Nature Lab team,
I wanted to make sure


92
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,917 line:-1
that all of our compatible apps
are made available,


93
00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:39.219 line:-1 position:50%
so I'll keep
the default settings here.


94
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.655 line:-1 position:50%
You can also manage
an individual app's availability


95
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,890 line:-1
from the
Pricing and Availability page.


96
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,127 position:50%
Under the iPhone and iPad Apps
on xrOS section,


97
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,262 position:50%
you have the option
to “Make this app available”.


98
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,864 position:50%
You can also verify
if your current


99
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:54,935 line:0
and upcoming app versions
are compatible with xrOS.


100
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,871 position:50%
To learn more about
compatible iPad and iPhone apps


101
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,739 position:50%
and how to make sure
your apps run properly,


102
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,740 position:50%
check out the sessions


103
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,844 position:50%
"Run your iPad and iPhone apps
in the Shared Space" and


104
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,247 line:0
"Enhance your iPad and iPhone
apps for the Shared Space".


105
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,050 line:-1
So we just covered all the ways
for setting up an xrOS app


106
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,284 line:-1
in App Store Connect.


107
00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:14.454 line:-1 position:50%
Next, you'll want to test
your xrOS and compatible iPad


108
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,491 line:-1
and iPhone apps to ensure
a solid user experience.


109
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,392 line:-1
And with that,
I'll pass it over to Maciej


110
00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.694 line:-1 position:50%
to talk to you about TestFlight.


111
00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:22.462 line:-1 position:50%
Maciej: Thank you, Justin!


112
00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:25.165 line:-1 position:50%
TestFlight is an essential tool
to help you distribute


113
00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:27.134 line:-1 position:50%
and install beta versions
of your apps.


114
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,002 line:-1
You can create
your teams of testers,


115
00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.771 line:-1 position:50%
define distribution rules,
and incorporate feedback


116
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,208 line:-1
to create best-in-class
applications for the App Store.


117
00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:36.643 line:-1 position:50%
To manage your beta testing,


118
00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:38.745 line:-1 position:50%
go to the App Store Connect
website.


119
00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:41.381 line:-1 position:50%
Check the TestFlight tab,
where you can create groups,


120
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:44.417 line:-1 position:50%
add testers,
and distribute builds.


121
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,319 line:-1
You can also manage
testers and groups


122
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,991 line:-1
using App Store Connect on iOS
or the App Store Connect API.


123
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,927 line:0
To get a general overview about
how to run your beta program,


124
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:57,497 position:50%
check out our Tech Talk on how
to get started with TestFlight.


125
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,033 position:50%
For more information on how
to automate distributing builds


126
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,102 line:0
in continuous
integration services,


127
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:07,140 line:0
watch our previous session
"Explore Xcode Cloud workflows."


128
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.177 line:-1 position:50%
TestFlight is available for all
existing operating systems


129
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,845 line:-1
and provides
a consistent experience


130
00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:13.813 line:-1 position:50%
for installing beta apps.


131
00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.883 line:-1 position:50%
Additionally, testers can send
screenshots and crash feedback


132
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,553 line:-1
on iOS and macOS.


133
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:23,456 line:-1
And today we are introducing
support for xrOS.


134
00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.393 line:-1 position:50%
TestFlight on xrOS will help you
test your immersive apps


135
00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:28.628 line:-1 position:50%
to make sure they offer
the best possible experience


136
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,498 line:-1
on the device and are ready
for the App Store.


137
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,434 line:-1
It also lets you install and run
iPad and iPhone apps


138
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,369 line:-1
to verify they are
fully compatible


139
00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:38.805 line:-1 position:50%
and work great on xrOS.


140
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,241 line:-1
In this section, I will walk you
through the major use cases


141
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:44,344 line:-1
of TestFlight to help you
distribute builds,


142
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,047 line:-1
install apps,
and collect feedback.


143
00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:49.282 line:-1 position:50%
Let's start
with distributing builds.


144
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,051 line:-1
Creating groups
and inviting testers


145
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,119 line:-1
is a feature available
for all platforms.


146
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,522 line:-1
It's no different for xrOS.


147
00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:58.358 line:-1 position:50%
You have an option to use
internal or external groups


148
00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.728 line:-1 position:50%
and invite testers
by email or public link.


149
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,531 line:-1
In this example,
the xrOS platform has been added


150
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,633 line:-1
to an existing app record.


151
00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:08.535 line:-1 position:50%
You can create
a new group of testers


152
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,837 line:-1
and start uploading
builds there.


153
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,706 line:-1
You can also distribute
xrOS builds


154
00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.908 line:-1 position:50%
through any existing group.


155
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,310 position:50%
In this scenario, testers
will have access to builds


156
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,379 line:0
for multiple platforms.


157
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,615 position:50%
TestFlight gives you
full control over which group


158
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,851 line:0
can install iOS apps on xrOS.


159
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,520 line:0
Each group has an option
to enable or disable


160
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,956 position:50%
the ability to install
iPhone and iPad apps


161
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,726 position:50%
by testers from this group
on the headset.


162
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,161 line:-1
This option can help you
expand the team of testers


163
00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:37.264 line:-1 position:50%
while you progress
with testing the compatibility


164
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,032 line:-1
of your iOS apps.


165
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,934 line:-1
Now that you know
how to distribute your builds,


166
00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:42.335 line:-1 position:50%
let me walk you
through the process


167
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:46,439 line:-1
of installing and running beta
apps on xrOS as a tester.


168
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,841 line:-1
After launching TestFlight,


169
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:52,212 line:-1
I can browse all the apps
developers invited me to test.


170
00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:55.649 line:-1 position:50%
My list in the sidebar includes
both xrOS and iOS apps


171
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,853 line:-1
that can be installed
and tested on my device.


172
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,855 line:-1
Applications not compatible
to install


173
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:06,893 line:-1
are listed in a separate
category of iOS-only apps.


174
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,528 line:-1
When a developer
invites me to test


175
00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:10.864 line:-1 position:50%
both the xrOS and iOS version,


176
00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:14.534 line:-1 position:50%
TestFlight allows me to switch
between each type of the app.


177
00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:17.203 line:-1 position:50%
Toggle at the top of the app
page allows me to choose


178
00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:20.140 line:-1 position:50%
which version I would like
to install and test.


179
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.709 line:-1 position:50%
From this page, I can check
the details of each app,


180
00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:24.144 line:-1 position:50%
review the description,


181
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,981 line:-1
confirm whether the app is
compatible with my device.


182
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:30.984 line:-1 position:50%
Additionally, I can scroll down
the list to App Settings


183
00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:34.654 line:-1 position:50%
and customize notifications
or opt in for automatic updates,


184
00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:37.390 line:-1 position:50%
in which case all new versions
of the app are downloaded


185
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.828 line:-1 position:50%
and installed automatically
by TestFlight on my device.


186
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,630 line:-1
Once the beta app is installed,


187
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,432 line:-1
I can launch it directly
from TestFlight


188
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,534 line:-1
or from the Home Screen.


189
00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:50.170 line:-1 position:50%
All beta apps are distinguished
by a yellow dot


190
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,407 line:-1
displayed next to the app name,
like on other platforms.


191
00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:56.142 line:-1 position:50%
Compatible iPad and iPhone apps


192
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,311 line:-1
are grouped together
in a dedicated folder,


193
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,016 line:-1
where the yellow dot is also
presented for beta versions.


194
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,617 line:-1
When I launch the updated app,


195
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,554 line:-1
TestFlight displays information
provided by the developer


196
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,989 line:-1
to describe changes
in the latest build.


197
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,026 line:-1
This is a good opportunity
for the developer to recommend


198
00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:16.796 line:-1 position:50%
which areas I should focus on
while testing the app.


199
00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:19.232 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let's talk about how you
can get feedback from testers


200
00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:22.168 line:-1 position:50%
about their experience
with your apps on xrOS.


201
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,037 line:-1
Testers can send feedback
when they notice issues


202
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,340 line:-1
within your app or if they want
to suggest some improvements.


203
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.110 line:-1 position:50%
As a tester, If I want to share
feedback with the developer


204
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.145 line:-1 position:50%
about my experience on xrOS,


205
00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:33.947 line:-1 position:50%
I can quickly press
the Digital Crown


206
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,983 line:-1
and top buttons together
to capture screenshots.


207
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,086 line:-1
Next, I open TestFlight,
select the app,


208
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:44,758 line:-1
and touch the Send Feedback
button to initiate the process.


209
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:48,661 line:-1
I start with describing
the problem.


210
00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:50.797 line:-1 position:50%
I attach all the screenshots
I have captured


211
00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:54.300 line:-1 position:50%
to support the feedback.


212
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.170 line:-1 position:50%
I can crop or annotate images
to focus the feedback


213
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.005 line:-1 position:50%
on the relevant part
of the screenshot


214
00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:03.042 line:-1 position:50%
or to hide any sensitive
information.


215
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,811 line:-1
Another situation
where I can provide feedback


216
00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:06.780 line:-1 position:50%
is when the beta app crashes.


217
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,615 line:-1
In this case,
TestFlight asks me


218
00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.150 line:-1 position:50%
if I want to send
more information


219
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,851 line:-1
to help debug the issue.


220
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:13.953 line:-1 position:50%
I can describe what steps
caused the crash,


221
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,522 line:-1
and the information
will be submitted


222
00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:18.625 line:-1 position:50%
along with the crash log
captured on the device.


223
00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:21.060 line:-1 position:50%
So far, I have presented how
testers can leverage TestFlight


224
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.963 line:-1 position:50%
on xrOS to install,
run beta apps,


225
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,632 line:-1
and share feedback.


226
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,801 line:-1
Now let's take a look how
App Store Connect and Xcode


227
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,771 line:-1
can help you analyze the data
and track tester engagement.


228
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,174 line:-1
You can review all submitted
feedback in App Store Connect


229
00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:35.575 line:-1 position:50%
and Xcode Organizer,


230
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.745 line:-1 position:50%
with filters to view
by platform or a build.


231
00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.346 line:-1 position:50%
You can check the details
of each feedback,


232
00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:42.682 line:-1 position:50%
review screenshots,
download crash logs,


233
00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:46.152 line:-1 position:50%
or open the feedback directly
in Xcode Organizer.


234
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,955 line:-1
App Store Connect web and mobile
also provide information


235
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,391 line:-1
about how many testers
installed and launched


236
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:53.126 line:-1 position:50%
a specific version of your app,


237
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,162 line:-1
or how many of them submitted
crash or screenshot feedback.


238
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,466 line:-1
This is an excellent tool
to track tester engagement.


239
00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:02.101 line:-1 position:50%
You can analyze the statistics
for a specific build


240
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,636 line:-1
or look over a specific group


241
00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:06.272 line:-1 position:50%
to see the engagement
of each tester.


242
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,975 line:-1
So that's a quick look at how
TestFlight can help you build


243
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,744 line:-1
high-quality apps and offer
a great user experience


244
00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:13.480 line:-1 position:50%
on the xrOS device.


245
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,682 line:-1
Now I will hand back
to Justin to tell you more


246
00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:17.884 line:-1 position:50%
about getting your apps
ready for the App Store.


247
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,886 line:-1
Justin: Thanks, Maciej.


248
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,421 line:-1
With beta testing wrapped up,


249
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,889 line:-1
let's jump back
to App Store Connect


250
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,825 line:-1
and put the finishing touches
on your app.


251
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,161 line:-1
You're able to manage your xrOS
apps using the features


252
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,697 line:-1
you've come to expect
from App Store Connect,


253
00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:35.235 line:-1 position:50%
from in-app purchases, to
screenshots, to app analytics.


254
00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:37.537 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a closer look
at a feature we've updated


255
00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:40.673 line:-1 position:50%
for spatial computing,
Privacy Nutrition Labels.


256
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,642 line:-1
With the release of xrOS,


257
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,079 line:-1
we added a few new data types
that your app may collect.


258
00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:49.249 line:-1 position:50%
These new data types
are relevant for xrOS apps,


259
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,619 line:-1
but they can also be applied
to other platforms.


260
00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:55.788 line:-1 position:50%
In the App Privacy section,
check “Environment Scanning”


261
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,324 line:-1
if your app collects data
about the user's surroundings,


262
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,594 line:-1
such as mesh, planes,
scene classification,


263
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,497 line:-1
or image detection
of the user's surrounding.


264
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,832 line:-1
Under the “Body” section,


265
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,367 line:-1
check “Hands”
if your app collects data


266
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,270 line:-1
about the user's hand structure
and hand movements,


267
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,838 line:-1
and “Head” if your app
collects data


268
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,806 line:-1
about the user's head movement.


269
00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:15.608 line:-1 position:50%
Once your app is published
on the App Store,


270
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,477 line:-1
customers can learn
from your app's product page


271
00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:19.345 line:-1 position:50%
about the data types
that your app collects


272
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,180 line:-1
and how they are used.


273
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,349 line:-1
We covered a lot today,
from setting up,


274
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,053 line:-1
to beta testing, to updating
your app's privacy details.


275
00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:29.389 line:-1 position:50%
Before I let you go,
let me give you a quick wrap-up


276
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,591 line:-1
for what you'll need to do next.


277
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:35.395 line:-1 position:50%
First, decide how you want
to get your app on xrOS.


278
00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.297 line:-1 position:50%
Are you going to create
a new app,


279
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,666 line:-1
add the xrOS platform
to an existing app,


280
00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.434 line:-1 position:50%
or choose to make
your compatible iPad


281
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,137 line:-1
and iPhone apps
available on xrOS?


282
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,906 line:-1
Beta test your xrOS and
compatible iPad and iPhone apps


283
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,274 line:-1
with TestFlight.


284
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,076 line:-1
Be sure and look
for submitted feedback


285
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,145 line:-1
and crashes from
your beta testers.


286
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,948 line:-1
Next, update your app's
privacy details


287
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,383 line:-1
so your customers are well
informed of the types of data


288
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,851 line:-1
that your app collects.


289
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,053 line:0
And finally, check out the


290
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,788 position:50%
"What's new
in App Store Connect" session


291
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,791 position:50%
to learn more about updates
across App Store Connect.

for development tips.


294
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,531 line:-1
And, as always,


295
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:13.066 line:-1 position:50%
we look forward
to hearing your feedback.


296
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,467 line:-1
Maciej: Thanks for watching!
