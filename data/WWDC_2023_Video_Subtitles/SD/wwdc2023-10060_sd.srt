Tony:
Hi, I'm Tony from Privacy Engineering.


4
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:16,917 line:-2
Welcome to
"Get started with Privacy Manifests."


5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.088 line:-2 align:center
At Apple, we believe privacy
is a fundamental human right.


6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,091 line:-2
In addition to techniques
like data minimization,


7
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,393 line:-1
a key part to bring this value to life


8
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,763 line:-2
is to make sure
people have transparency and control.


9
00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:33.901 line:-2 align:center
To support this, we now provide new tools
to make it even easier for you


10
00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:36.570 line:-2 align:center
to provide accurate
Privacy Nutrition Labels


11
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,840 line:-1
and integrate App Tracking Transparency.


12
00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:44.878 line:-2 align:center
This is because the apps you build
are integral parts of people's lives.


13
00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:48.649 line:-2 align:center
There are many apps to choose from,
and as a refresher,


14
00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:52.386 line:-2 align:center
Privacy Nutrition Labels help people
learn more about how your apps


15
00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:55.322 line:-1 align:center
collect and use their data.


16
00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.291 line:-1 align:center
People often want to know:


17
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:00,994 line:-2
What are the categories of data
that apps collect about them?


18
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,297 line:-1
Is data used to track them?


19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,499 line:-1
Is data linked to them?


20
00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:08.702 line:-2 align:center
Privacy Nutrition Labels
demonstrate the great privacy work


21
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,370 line:-1
that you've done in your apps,


22
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:14,274 line:-2
and they give people the information
they need to make great choices.


23
00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:17.110 line:-2 align:center
For all new and updated apps
on the App Store,


24
00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:22.182 line:-2 align:center
developers like you have been
providing Privacy Nutrition Labels.


25
00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.751 line:-2 align:center
And you've been using
App Tracking Transparency


26
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:28,789 line:-2
to give people control over
when their data is used to track them.


27
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,359 line:-2
It's now easier for you
to provide accurate Nutrition Labels


28
00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:35.562 line:-1 align:center
and integrate App Tracking Transparency.


29
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,398 line:-2
You are responsible for all code
included in your apps,


30
00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.634 line:-1 align:center
per the App Store Review Guidelines.


31
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,271 line:-2
This includes any data collection
and tracking practices.


32
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:49,643 line:-2
A large part of your app's privacy story
often depends on third-party SDKs.


33
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,646 line:-2
We have heard from developers like you
that it can be challenging


34
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,448 line:-1
to get all the information you need


35
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:58.018 line:-2 align:center
from the great third-party SDKs
that your apps depend on.


36
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.688 line:-2 align:center
Privacy manifests are a new way
for third-party SDK developers


37
00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:04.858 line:-2 align:center
to provide information
about their privacy practices.


38
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:09,296 line:-2
This information helps you
accurately represent privacy in your app.


39
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,469 line:-2
Third-party SDK developers can
include a privacy manifest in their SDK.


40
00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:19.840 line:-2 align:center
They can create a new privacy manifest
right from the Xcode navigator,


41
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:24,211 line:-2
by creating a file named
"PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy".


42
00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:30.817 line:-2 align:center
This file is a property list that declares
what data types the SDK collects,


43
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.886 line:-1 align:center
how each data type is used,


44
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,755 line:-1
whether they are linked to the user,


45
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,490 line:-1
and whether they're used for tracking


46
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,194 line:-2
as defined by
the App Tracking Transparency policy.


47
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,362 align:center
Taking a closer look at this manifest,


48
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:46,967 align:center
the Example Sharing SDK is listed
as not tracking.


49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,904 line:-2
It collects name and user ID,
linked to the user,


50
00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:55.242 line:-2 align:center
for both app functionality
and product personalization.


51
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,244 line:-1
It also collects photos or videos,


52
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,414 line:-2
linked to the user,
for just app functionality.


53
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,586 line:0
Check that the privacy manifest
matches your understanding


54
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,288 line:0
of the third-party SDK's functionality.


55
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:12,259 align:center
The definitions for types of data
and data use for privacy manifests


56
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,561 align:center
are the same as for the Nutrition Label,


57
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:19,967 align:center
so refer to the Apple developer
documentation on app privacy details.


58
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:25,272 line:-2
And the new privacy report
brings all this information to one place.


59
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,541 line:-1
Let me show you how that works.


60
00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:31.111 line:-2 align:center
When you're building your app
to submit to the App Store,


61
00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:35.983 line:-2 align:center
Xcode 15 can aggregate all the privacy
manifests in your app's project,


62
00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:40.888 line:-2 align:center
and produce a privacy report
that summarizes the declared data uses.


63
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,957 line:-1
To view this, go to Xcode Organizer,


64
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.360 line:-1 align:center
show the context menu for an archive,


65
00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:49.496 line:-1 align:center
and select "Generate Privacy Report."


66
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:54,935 line:-2
The privacy report is a PDF
and easy to use.


67
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,872 line:-2
It is organized in a similar way
to Privacy Nutrition Labels.


68
00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:01.441 line:-1 align:center
So you can easily reference this report


69
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:05,412 line:-2
when you provide your app's privacy
details in App Store Connect.


70
00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:09.716 line:-2 align:center
This helps you review, understand,
and describe the privacy practices


71
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,252 line:-1
of your app and its dependencies.


72
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,423 align:center
To learn more about Nutrition Labels,


73
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:21,862 line:0
watch the WWDC22 video:
Create your Privacy Nutrition Label.


74
00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:28.769 line:-2 align:center
Another feature of privacy manifests
is helping you manage tracking domains,


75
00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:31.205 line:-1 align:center
by making it easier for you to understand


76
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,841 line:-2
and control network connections
from your app.


77
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.445 line:-2 align:center
While you don't intend
to track people without their permission,


78
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,582 line:-2
there may be edge cases that create
un-intended network connections


79
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,051 line:-1
to domains that are used for tracking.


80
00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:48.222 line:-2 align:center
For example, many third-party SDKs
check tracking permission status


81
00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:49.890 line:-1 align:center
before tracking people.


82
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:54,862 line:-2
However, some third-party SDKs rely on you
to manually disable tracking


83
00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:57.598 line:-1 align:center
when the user has not granted permission.


84
00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.067 line:-2 align:center
The third-party SDK might default
to tracking


85
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.002 line:-1 align:center
unless you specify otherwise,


86
00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:04.104 line:-2 align:center
either through a function
in their library,


87
00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.139 line:-1 align:center
or some configuration change.


88
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,308 line:-1
This could lead to edge cases.


89
00:05:08.342 --> 00:05:11.612 line:-2 align:center
To make it easier for you
and third-party SDK developers


90
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,481 line:-2
to avoid tracking people
without their permission,


91
00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:18.519 line:-2 align:center
privacy manifests that declare tracking
include tracking domains.


92
00:05:18.552 --> 00:05:21.722 line:-2 align:center
In cases when a user has not provided
tracking permission,


93
00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:25.425 line:-2 align:center
iOS 17 automatically blocks connections
to tracking domains


94
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:29,663 line:-2
that have been specified in any privacy
manifest included in your app.


95
00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:32.599 line:-1 align:center
This helps you eliminate those edge cases.


96
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:37,137 line:-2
In addition to the privacy
manifests included in third-party SDKs,


97
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:40.841 line:-2 align:center
you can also choose to create
a privacy manifest for your app,


98
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:44,111 line:-1
which may also include tracking domains.


99
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,346 line:-1
By preventing accidental connections,


100
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,716 line:-2
this feature helps to preserve
your intention to not track users


101
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.418 line:-1 align:center
without their permission.


102
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:55,155 line:-2
Tell iOS your tracking domains,
and the system will help.


103
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,692 align:center
For more information about tracking,


104
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,727 align:center
visit the Apple Developer website,


105
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,997 line:0
or watch the WWDC22 video,


106
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,867 align:center
Explore App Tracking Transparency.


107
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:11,705 line:-2
In some cases,
domains may be used for both tracking


108
00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:14.007 line:-1 align:center
and non-tracking functionality.


109
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:18,312 line:-2
An approach that you or a third-party SDK
developer could take


110
00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:22.082 line:-2 align:center
is to separate the functionality
into different host names.


111
00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:27.454 line:-2 align:center
For example, you can host tracking
functionality at tracking.example.com,


112
00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:32.125 line:-2 align:center
and non-tracking functionality
at non-tracking.example.com.


113
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,995 line:-1
Then, declare tracking.example.com


114
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:38,098 line:-2
as a tracking domain
in the privacy manifest.


115
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,136 line:-2
You may not always realize if your app,
or a third-party SDK,


116
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.772 line:-1 align:center
is connecting to a tracking domain.


117
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,809 line:-2
In Xcode 15,
the Points of Interest instrument


118
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,411 line:-2
can help you with this
during your testing.


119
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:55,082 line:-2
It now shows connections to domains
that may be following people


120
00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:59.353 line:-2 align:center
across multiple apps and websites
to combine their activity into a profile.


121
00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.724 line:-1 align:center
This puts you in the driver's seat,


122
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,660 line:-2
and you can assess whether a domain is
used for tracking


123
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,763 line:-2
under the App Tracking
Transparency policy.


124
00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:13.333 line:-1 align:center
If it is, then you or your SDK developer


125
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:17,271 line:-2
should declare the domain as a tracking
domain in the privacy manifest.


126
00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:22.142 line:-2 align:center
With the user's permission,
tracking is allowed.


127
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:25,312 line:-1
However, fingerprinting is never allowed.


128
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,115 line:-2
Fingerprinting is using signals
from the device


129
00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:31.118 line:-1 align:center
to try to identify the device or user.


130
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:34,688 line:-2
Regardless of whether a user
gives your app permission to track,


131
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:37.858 line:-1 align:center
fingerprinting is not allowed.


132
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,194 line:-2
There are existing APIs
in our platforms


133
00:07:40.227 --> 00:07:43.497 line:-2 align:center
that have the potential
of being mis-used for fingerprinting.


134
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.467 line:-2 align:center
However, these APIs also provide
powerful user experiences


135
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:49.837 line:-1 align:center
when accessed appropriately.


136
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.706 line:-2 align:center
To support important use cases
that benefit the user


137
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,641 line:-1
while avoiding fingerprinting,


138
00:07:54,675 --> 00:08:00,414 line:-2
there is a new category of APIs
called Required reason APIs.


139
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:04,017 line:-2
We have begun
by grouping these APIs into categories,


140
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,720 line:-2
taking into consideration
their functionality


141
00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:09.122 line:-1 align:center
and the information they provide.


142
00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:12.125 line:-2 align:center
For each category,
there is a list of approved reasons


143
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,563 line:-2
to access these APIs,
based on their use cases.


144
00:08:16.597 --> 00:08:21.869 line:-2 align:center
For example, one Required reason API
is NSFileSystemFreeSize,


145
00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:25.706 line:-2 align:center
which indicates the amount of free space
on the file system.


146
00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:28.342 line:-2 align:center
One of its approved reasons
supports using this API


147
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:32,446 line:-2
to check whether there is sufficient
disk space before writing files to disk.


148
00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.950 line:-2 align:center
The list of Required reason APIs
and approved reasons,


149
00:08:36.984 --> 00:08:38.685 line:-1 align:center
including any future updates,


150
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,657 line:0
is published in the Apple
developer documentation.


151
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.361 line:-2 align:center
The total number
of Required reason APIs is small,


152
00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:50.731 line:-2 align:center
but it is likely
that you use one or more of them.


153
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:54,434 line:-2
If you have a use case for an API category
that is not already covered


154
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,903 line:-1
by an approved reason,


155
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,405 line:-2
and the use case directly benefits
the user,


156
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:02,910 line:-2
the documentation will link to a feedback
form where you can let us know.


157
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:07,147 line:-2
To protect users
from possible fingerprinting,


158
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,783 line:-1
apps and SDKs are allowed to access


159
00:09:09.816 --> 00:09:13.687 line:-2 align:center
the Required reason APIs
only for the approved reasons.


160
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.292 line:-2 align:center
Data returned from these APIs
may not be used for other purposes.


161
00:09:18.325 --> 00:09:22.696 line:-2 align:center
To help you clearly state
why you use Required reason APIs,


162
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:27,100 line:-2
and to make it easy for third-party
SDK developers to do the same,


163
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:30,737 line:-2
privacy manifests
include this information.


164
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,775 line:-2
An app or third-party SDK
that accesses a Required reason API


165
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:39,313 line:-2
declares the API category,
and all of its reasons for using the API.


166
00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:44.251 line:-2 align:center
These must be selected from the list
of approved reasons for that category.


167
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,387 line:-2
Just like Nutrition Labels
in the App Store,


168
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:50.224 line:-2 align:center
which help people
make choices about your app,


169
00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:54.394 line:-2 align:center
privacy manifests help you make decisions
about your dependencies.


170
00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:57.564 line:-2 align:center
Each privacy manifest also gives you
a better picture


171
00:09:57.598 --> 00:10:02.369 line:-2 align:center
of your app's privacy story by making
the Xcode privacy report more complete.


172
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:07,207 line:-2
It's a great idea to leverage third-party
SDKs that provide privacy manifests,


173
00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:11.745 line:-2 align:center
and SDK authors can add manifests
to existing versions of their SDKs.


174
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.415 line:-1 align:center
Looking at the app ecosystem,


175
00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:17.818 line:-1 align:center
we have identified some third-party SDKs


176
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:21,221 line:-2
that have particularly high impact
on user privacy.


177
00:10:21.255 --> 00:10:24.525 line:-1 align:center
These are called privacy-impacting SDKs.


178
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:28,929 line:-2
A list of these third-party SDKs,
and any future updates,


179
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,866 line:-2
is published
in the Apple developer documentation.


180
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.969 line:-2 align:center
Because it is especially important
for you to get information


181
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,505 line:-1
from privacy-impacting SDKs,


182
00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:41.275 line:-1 align:center
apps that include a privacy-impacting SDK


183
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:46,346 line:-2
will be required to include a copy
of that SDK with a privacy manifest.


184
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,750 line:-1
Xcode 15 also supports SDK signatures,


185
00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:51.285 line:-1 align:center
which help you protect your app


186
00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:55.022 line:-2 align:center
and verify the integrity
of third-party SDKs.


187
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:59,793 line:-2
Including a signature is a best practice
for all third-party SDKs.


188
00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:03.931 line:-2 align:center
To help you confirm that the developer
you expect provided the privacy manifest


189
00:11:03.964 --> 00:11:06.133 line:-1 align:center
for privacy-impacting SDKs,


190
00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.769 line:-1 align:center
apps that include a privacy-impacting SDK


191
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:13,106 line:-2
will also be required to ensure
that the SDK is signed.


192
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.909 line:-1 align:center
For more information about SDK signatures,


193
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:20,948 line:0
watch "Verify app dependencies
with digital signatures."


194
00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:23.183 line:-1 align:center
Starting in Fall 2023,


195
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,919 line:-2
App Store will check
if new and updated apps


196
00:11:25.953 --> 00:11:29.623 line:-2 align:center
include a library
from a privacy-impacting SDK.


197
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:34,728 line:-2
If the privacy-impacting SDK does not
include a signature and privacy manifest,


198
00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:39.099 line:-2 align:center
Apple will send an informational email
to the app developer.


199
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,935 line:-2
Apple will also send
informational emails for apps


200
00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:47.007 line:-2 align:center
that access Required Reason APIs
without declaring approved reasons.


201
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.412 line:-2 align:center
Starting in Spring 2024, these will be
expected and become part of App Review.


202
00:11:52.446 --> 00:11:54.848 line:-2 align:center
You'll need to address any issues
before you can submit


203
00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:58.785 line:-1 align:center
new and updated apps to the App Store.


204
00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:01.488 line:-1 align:center
Okay, here's what's next.


205
00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:05.158 line:-2 align:center
App developers:
Ask for SDK privacy manifests


206
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,828 line:-1
from your third-party SDK developers.


207
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,832 line:-2
Always refer to the Xcode privacy report
when you are submitting your app


208
00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.701 line:-1 align:center
to keep your Nutrition Label up to date.


209
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,805 line:-2
SDK developers:
Adopt signatures and manifests.


210
00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.942 line:-1 align:center
These are super helpful to your customers.


211
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,379 line:-2
All developers:
Document and declare tracking domains


212
00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:30.684 line:-2 align:center
and Required Reason API usage
in your app or SDK's privacy manifest.


213
00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:34.588 line:-2 align:center
With the new privacy manifests,
providing accurate, complete,


214
00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:39.693 line:-2 align:center
and clear privacy information
to your users will be easier than ever.


215
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,361 line:-1
Thanks for watching.
