Patrick: Hi, I'm Patrick,


4
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,548 line:-1
an engineer on the Device Management team.


5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,316 line:-1
Together with my colleague Jonathan,


6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.785 line:-2 align:center
I'm delighted to share with you
the new features we have


7
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,321 line:-1
for managing Apple devices.


8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:25,125 line:-2
We love seeing Apple devices being used
every day at work and school.


9
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,694 line:-2
Whether this is to teach a subject
to a class


10
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:31,064 line:-2
or enabling and simplifying
business workflows.


11
00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:34.601 line:-2 align:center
We want to help IT administrators
to make it easy for their users


12
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,604 line:-1
to do something great with their devices.


13
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,674 line:-2
In this session we'll be covering
many of the new features


14
00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.410 line:-2 align:center
that will help you
to manage and deploy at scale.


15
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,445 line:-1
Many will be covered in this section,


16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,947 line:-1
but before we dive in,


17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,783 line:-2
I want to highlight a few other sessions
that cover areas


18
00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:52.786 line:-2 align:center
where we've additionally
made significant improvements.


19
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.191 line:-2 align:center
Managed Apple IDs became more powerful
and versatile this year


20
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:01,495 line:-2
with updates to Continuity, Apple Wallet,
and iCloud Keychain.


21
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,765 line:-2
And IT administrators get
additional controls to make it easier


22
00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:08.702 line:-2 align:center
for their users to sign in to the apps
and services they need at work.


23
00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.806 line:-2 align:center
A Managed Apple ID can also be used
in more places to enroll a device


24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,176 line:-2
while keeping personal
and work data separated.


25
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,546 line:-2
And to allow even more organizations
to leverage those benefits,


26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,417 line:-2
we are also adding OpenID Connect support
in Apple School Manager


27
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,285 line:-1
and Apple Business Manager.


28
00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:30.157 line:-2 align:center
This allows federation with any identity
provider supporting this protocol.


29
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,762 align:center
Be sure to check out session "Do more with
Managed Apple IDs" to learn more.


30
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:39,233 line:-2
With the addition of iCloud Keychain
to Managed Apple IDs


31
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.669 line:-2 align:center
and new Declarative Device Management
configuration options,


32
00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:47.474 line:-2 align:center
businesses can now go passwordless
with passkeys.


33
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,243 line:0
Our dedicated session
"Deploy passkeys at work"


34
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,045 line:0
provides more information on that topic.


35
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,382 line:-2
Declarative device management
has been significantly enhanced


36
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:59,686 line:-2
and supports new ways to deploy
applications, certificates,


37
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.591 line:-2 align:center
and on macOS, even manage
common service configuration files.


38
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:08.195 line:-2 align:center
Software Update takes advantage
of declarative device management


39
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:12,132 line:-2
and now allows IT administrators
to enforce software updates


40
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,936 line:-2
to specific deadlines
with improved user transparency.


41
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:22,009 line:0
Watch session "Advances in declarative
device management" for in-depth details.


42
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:26,013 line:-2
And this year, we are expanding
device management to Apple Watch.


43
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,482 line:-1
Apple Watch can now be enrolled into MDM,


44
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:32,152 line:-2
supporting even more
institutional use-cases.


45
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:36,323 line:0
The session "Discover watchOS management"
has more details on how it works


46
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,158 align:center
and what you can do.


47
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:42,596 line:-2
For this session we'll focus on
how macOS can support organizations


48
00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.165 line:-2 align:center
to more easily meet
their security requirements


49
00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:49.303 line:-2 align:center
and how you can use your identity provider
in even more places,


50
00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:53.240 line:-2 align:center
how iOS and iPadOS are better supporting
common use-cases


51
00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.809 line:-1 align:center
and what's new with cellular networks.


52
00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:59.646 line:-2 align:center
Throughout the session we will also
discover how Apple Configurator can help


53
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.250 line:-2 align:center
to reduce manual steps
and increase automation.


54
00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:05.118 line:-1 align:center
Let's get started with macOS.


55
00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:06.787 line:-1 align:center
To tell you all about it,


56
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,823 line:-2
I'm going to hand over
to my colleague Jonathan.


57
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:10,891 line:-2
Jonathan:
Thank you, Patrick.


58
00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:14.461 line:-2 align:center
Hi, I'm Jonathan Broskey, an Engineer
on the Device Management team.


59
00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.763 line:-2 align:center
I'm really excited to be here today
to tell you about


60
00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:19.900 line:-2 align:center
some awesome new device
management features in macOS 14.


61
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,536 line:-1
Starting with Automated Device Enrollment.


62
00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.105 line:-2 align:center
This is a great way to provide
a seamless enrollment


63
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,341 line:-1
and setup experience for your users.


64
00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:30.143 line:-2 align:center
However, we understand
that organizations want to ensure


65
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,513 line:-2
certain security configurations
are in place


66
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:37,451 line:-2
even before the Mac is enrolled
and the user logs in for the first time.


67
00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:42.856 line:-2 align:center
For example, organizations want
to make sure FileVault is turned on,


68
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,293 line:-2
the device is on a specific version
of the operating system,


69
00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.262 line:-1 align:center
and enrolled in MDM.


70
00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:49.730 line:-1 align:center
We have some great improvements


71
00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:53.367 line:-2 align:center
to the Automated Device Enrollment process
this year.


72
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,335 line:-1
Starting with FileVault.


73
00:03:55.369 --> 00:04:01.575 line:-2 align:center
macOS 14 allows MDM to require FileVault
enablement right during Setup Assistant.


74
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,579 line:-2
IT administrators can chose whether
to show the FileVault recovery key


75
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:10,284 line:-2
during Setup Assistant
or optionally escrow it to MDM.


76
00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:13.020 line:-1 align:center
Additionally, MDM can require the device


77
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:16,857 line:-2
to be on a specific operating system
version in order to enroll.


78
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.927 line:-2 align:center
This ensures that devices are on
the necessary OS version


79
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,095 line:-1
before being put into production.


80
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,399 line:-1
The MDM will send a JSON 403 response


81
00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:28.569 line:-2 align:center
when the device requests
the enrollment profile.


82
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,338 line:-2
If the minimum operating system version
is needed,


83
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:35,742 line:-2
the user will be guided through a process
of updating their Mac.


84
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.345 line:-1 align:center
Restarts will be performed automatically.


85
00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.848 line:-2 align:center
Once completed,
the Mac returns to Setup Assistant


86
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,784 line:-2
and the user can finish the enrollment
and setup process.


87
00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:48.288 line:-2 align:center
Lastly, we have added safeguards
to ensure the user completes


88
00:04:48.322 --> 00:04:52.192 line:-2 align:center
Automated Device Enrollment
once a network connection is established.


89
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,663 line:-2
Currently, in the case where
the Mac is not connected to a network


90
00:04:56.697 --> 00:04:58.465 line:-1 align:center
during the initial setup,


91
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,801 line:-1
the MDM enrollment is skipped.


92
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:05,439 line:-2
A notification will appear
requesting to be enrolled.


93
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,275 line:-2
This year, we have changed
the entire user experience


94
00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.645 line:-2 align:center
by launching into
a full screen Setup Assistant.


95
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,514 line:-1
After a network is connected,


96
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:17,618 line:-2
the user will be presented with
"Setup Assistant" giving them two options:


97
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,921 line:-1
continuing the enrollment, or "Not Now"


98
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,123 line:-1
which will allow the user eight hours


99
00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:26.827 line:-2 align:center
before they will be required
to enroll in MDM.


100
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,930 line:-2
Something to note,
that user can still enroll at any time


101
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,832 line:-1
by going to System Settings.


102
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,268 line:-1
Now with the changes to macOS 14,


103
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:38.605 line:-2 align:center
the user and the IT administrator can
ensure that the data is secure,


104
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,874 line:-2
the device is on
the proper operating system,


105
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:43,510 line:-1
and the device is managed in MDM.


106
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:44,745 line:-1
We think you're really going to like


107
00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:47.648 line:-2 align:center
these new additions
to Automated Device Enrollment.


108
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,817 line:-2
Now that the device is configured,
and enrolled in MDM,


109
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:54.154 line:-2 align:center
you will need access
to your Applications and Websites.


110
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,323 line:-1
User authentication is an important aspect


111
00:05:56.356 --> 00:06:00.227 line:-2 align:center
to ensure only authorized individuals
get access to their corporate data.


112
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.565 line:-2 align:center
However, oftentimes this requires
different digital identities.


113
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,301 line:-1
Platform Single Sign-On helps with this.


114
00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:10.804 line:-2 align:center
In macOS Ventura,
Platform Single Sign-On made it possible


115
00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:15.075 line:-2 align:center
to authenticate once with an account
from the organization's Identity Provider


116
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:19,880 line:-2
and get access to all services
a user should have access to.


117
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,816 line:-2
This year,
we are taking Platform SSO even further


118
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,384 line:-1
with exciting new capabilities


119
00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:29.890 line:-2 align:center
that allow users to use their corporate
identity in even more places in macOS.


120
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:33,627 line:-2
System Settings can now show
the status of Platform SSO.


121
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.262 line:-1 align:center
You can repair your registration


122
00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:38.465 line:-2 align:center
or reauthenticate
with your Identity Provider.


123
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:43,871 line:-2
Many organizations that use shared devices
also want to create new users at login.


124
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:48,175 line:-2
Platform SSO now also supports
on-demand creation of a local account,


125
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,944 line:-2
when a new user authenticates
at the login window


126
00:06:50.978 --> 00:06:55.482 line:-2 align:center
using a credential from
their organization's Identity Provider.


127
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,885 line:-1
It's enabled by using a shared device key


128
00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:01.021 line:-2 align:center
that allows the device
to maintain a trusted connection


129
00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:05.392 line:-2 align:center
to the Identity Provider
independent of a specific user.


130
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:10,030 line:-2
Certain requirements need to be in place
for the local account creation to happen.


131
00:07:10.063 --> 00:07:13.634 line:-2 align:center
The Mac needs to be able to connect
to the Identity Provider.


132
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:18,338 line:-2
The device also needs to be at
login window with FileVault unlocked.


133
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:22,109 line:-2
The organization's MDM must support
Bootstrap Tokens.


134
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,011 line:-1
If all of those conditions are met,


135
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,781 line:-2
users can use their Identity Provider
username and password


136
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,851 line:-1
or SmartCard to create an account.


137
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,287 line:-2
With this new support,
SmartCards can now be used


138
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.790 line:-2 align:center
to authenticate at the login window
and screen saver.


139
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,760 line:-2
After authentication,
Identity Provider groups can be used


140
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,095 line:-1
to assign user permissions.


141
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:46,633 line:-2
The MDM profile can define
which access level will be used:


142
00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:49.469 line:-2 align:center
standard user permissions,
administrator privileges,


143
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,040 line:-2
or permissions defined
by the group membership.


144
00:07:53.073 --> 00:07:56.577 line:-2 align:center
The same profile can also define
how identity provider groups


145
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,513 line:-1
map to local groups on the Mac.


146
00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:02.850 line:-2 align:center
With network authorization, we expand
the concept of group management


147
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,252 line:-1
to users which do not have a local account


148
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,956 line:-2
and allow them to be used
at authorization prompts.


149
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:14,595 line:-2
Bear in mind that non-local users
cannot be used for authorization prompts


150
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:18,165 line:-2
specifically asking
for the current logged in user,


151
00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:21.401 line:-2 align:center
or require a user with SecureToken
or ownership rights.


152
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:25,572 line:-2
Let's look at an example of
how this could be configured.


153
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,941 line:-1
In this Extensible SSO profile,


154
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,410 line:-2
Platform SSO group membership
is configured


155
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:33,914 line:-1
in the new Platform SSO dictionary.


156
00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:39.253 line:-2 align:center
Group membership is applied to local users
when the UserAuthorization mode is Groups.


157
00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:44.925 line:-2 align:center
The same groups are also used for network
accounts when EnableAuthorization is true.


158
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,929 line:-2
For AdministratorGroups, if the local
or non-local user is part of a group


159
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:53,534 line:-2
listed in this array, they can be used
at admin authorization prompts.


160
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,972 line:-2
AuthorizationGroups are specific groups
used to grant access


161
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:03,110 line:-2
to otherwise restricted rights
as defined by the authorization database.


162
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,179 line:-1
In this example, the user gets the ability


163
00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:08.215 line:-2 align:center
to modify printer configurations
in System Settings,


164
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,884 line:-2
without requiring
administrative privileges.


165
00:09:10.918 --> 00:09:14.188 line:-2 align:center
An entry in the AdditionalGroups array
creates a local group


166
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,625 line:-2
if it doesn't exist and makes it available
in the local directory service.


167
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,062 line:-2
In this example,
sudo is configured to use this group.


168
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,599 line:-2
Another part of user authentication
is password management.


169
00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:29.937 line:-2 align:center
I'm excited to touch on a few additions
we have made in this area.


170
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.707 line:-2 align:center
Securing passwords is essential
in a corporate or educational environment.


171
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.276 line:-2 align:center
Some environments have
more complex password requirements


172
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,514 line:-2
than what can be configured
with the existing options.


173
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:44,084 line:-2
This year we are adding even more
flexibility by allowing password policies


174
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,453 line:-1
to be defined as regular expressions.


175
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,356 line:-2
Since regular expressions
can be difficult to work with,


176
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:53,861 line:-2
you should still use existing
password policy options whenever possible.


177
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:57,731 line:-2
We have also added stronger
Password Compliance management.


178
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:02,069 line:-2
For macOS 14, we've changed the way
Password compliance is communicated.


179
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,204 line:-2
When a stricter password policy
is installed,


180
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:06,139 line:-1
a notification will be displayed


181
00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:09.843 line:-2 align:center
advising that the user's password
may not be compliant.


182
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,712 line:-1
The notification will only appear


183
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:15,849 line:-2
if the password may not meet
the installed payload policy.


184
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:19,253 line:-2
Compliance will be checked
during the next time the user logs in,


185
00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.355 line:-1 align:center
and if the password is not compliant,


186
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,991 line:-1
a notification will be displayed.


187
00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:27.628 line:-2 align:center
The user will be given an option
to change now or change later.


188
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:30.597 line:-2 align:center
If the user decides
to change the password at a later time,


189
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:33.901 line:-2 align:center
the same notification will be shown
every time the user logs in


190
00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.669 line:-1 align:center
until the password is compliant.


191
00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:38.372 line:-2 align:center
Now let's take a look
at some new restrictions


192
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,041 line:-1
that help secure your Mac even further.


193
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,311 line:-2
Sometimes organizations want to restrict
what settings


194
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:48,215 line:-2
users or administrators can configure
on their Mac.


195
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,018 line:-2
In the past,
entire System Preference panes were hidden


196
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,986 line:-1
to fulfill this requirement.


197
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,022 line:-1
With the introduction of System Settings,


198
00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:58.258 line:-2 align:center
we were able to implement
a granular management approach.


199
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,260 line:-1
Instead of hiding entire panes,


200
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:03,597 line:-2
the administrator can restrict
modifications of a specific setting


201
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.134 line:-2 align:center
which now shows a label
about its management state.


202
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.969 line:-1 align:center
Now in macOS 14,


203
00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.972 line:-2 align:center
new restrictions prevent users
from modifying Apple ID Logins


204
00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:15.342 line:-2 align:center
and Internet Accounts,
adding local user accounts,


205
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,846 line:-2
and many more,
like preventing Time Machine Backups.


206
00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:22.015 line:-2 align:center
Last year we introduced
Managed Device Attestation,


207
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:25.219 line:-2 align:center
a security feature
that uses the attestation capabilities


208
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,187 line:-1
of the Secure Enclave.


209
00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:31.491 line:-2 align:center
A device provides strong evidence
about itself when making a request.


210
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,294 line:-2
Managed Device Attestation means
legitimate devices


211
00:11:34.328 --> 00:11:38.232 line:-2 align:center
reliably access resources,
and attackers are foiled.


212
00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:42.035 line:-2 align:center
It does this by providing these assurances
about the device.


213
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:44.671 line:-2 align:center
This is a building block
that only provides security benefits


214
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:50,644 line:-2
if the deployment model built around
managed devices use attestations properly.


215
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:55,516 line:-2
Here are some deployment models
to consider for your organization.


216
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:59,486 line:-2
This first model proves
the device's identity to the MDM server


217
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.523 line:-1 align:center
and does not involve other servers.


218
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,392 line:-2
There is an ACME server integrated
into the MDM server,


219
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:08,795 line:-2
which issues certificates
only for MDM purposes.


220
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,232 line:-2
The MDM server also uses
DeviceInformation attestation


221
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:15,169 line:-1
to keep tabs on the device's properties.


222
00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:18.872 line:-2 align:center
In this model it is important to use
both the ACME attestation


223
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,908 line:-1
and the DeviceInformation attestation


224
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,610 line:-2
to know all about the device
it is managing


225
00:12:23.644 --> 00:12:26.914 line:-2 align:center
to make sure
the security requirements are addressed.


226
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:30,584 line:-2
The second model puts the most authority
on the ACME server.


227
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:35,956 line:-2
The ACME server performs trust evaluation
starting with properties' attestation,


228
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,493 line:-2
and decides whether to issue
a certificate or not.


229
00:12:39.526 --> 00:12:43.664 line:-2 align:center
The issued certificate can contain
whatever your organization needs.


230
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,699 line:-2
Subsequent servers
that the device connects to,


231
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,634 line:-1
also known as relying parties,


232
00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:51.338 line:-2 align:center
don't need to perform
any additional tasks.


233
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,975 line:-2
With the third model, the ACME server
doesn't perform trust evaluation.


234
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,678 line:-2
Instead, it simply copies
the device properties


235
00:12:57.711 --> 00:13:00.614 line:-2 align:center
from the attestation
into the issued certificate.


236
00:13:00.647 --> 00:13:04.418 line:-2 align:center
It's up to the relying parties to perform
their own trust evaluation.


237
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:07.287 line:-2 align:center
Something to note,
you can combine concepts from each model


238
00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:09.256 line:-1 align:center
to suit your environment.


239
00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.758 line:-1 align:center
And this year, I am so happy to announce


240
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,095 line:-2
that we've brought
Managed Device Attestation to macOS!


241
00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:20.367 line:-2 align:center
Just like iOS, it supports all the
features of Managed Device attestation.


242
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,471 line:-2
Also on macOS, ACME attestation
provisions hardware-bound keys


243
00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:27.875 line:-2 align:center
based upon
those same reliable device properties.


244
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:32,312 line:-2
As a reminder, hardware-bound keys are
stored in the data protection keychain.


245
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:35,249 line:-2
These keys can be used
with services such as VPN,


246
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:39,353 line:-1
802.1x, Kerberos, Exchange, and MDM.


247
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,422 line:0
For more information
on how Managed Device attestation works,


248
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:44,491 align:center
please visit last year's WWDC session,


249
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:47,694 align:center
"Discover Managed Device Attention."


250
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:50,731 line:-2
We are also adding new properties
to the attestation certificate,


251
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:54,134 line:-2
which include
SIP Status, secure boot status,


252
00:13:54.168 --> 00:13:57.404 line:-2 align:center
and whether third-party kernel extensions
are allowed.


253
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,773 line:-2
We are also adding new properties
for all platforms


254
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,009 line:-1
that support Managed Device Attestation.


255
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:05,612 line:-2
The new attributes will attest:
the low-level boot loader version,


256
00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:09.316 line:-2 align:center
operating system version,
and Software Update Device ID.


257
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:12.186 line:-2 align:center
A new Secure Enclave Enrollment ID
property


258
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:15,556 line:-2
associates the attestation
with an enrollment.


259
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,525 line:-2
If two different attestations
have the same ID,


260
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,629 line:-2
you have strong evidence that those
attestations came from the same device.


261
00:14:22.663 --> 00:14:27.000 line:-2 align:center
If the device unenrolls and reenrolls,
the IDs change.


262
00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:30.270 line:-2 align:center
Different servers can prove they
are communicating with the same device


263
00:14:30.304 --> 00:14:33.807 line:-2 align:center
by comparing
Secure Enclave Enrollment IDs.


264
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,143 line:-2
None of these new properties
are device-identifying,


265
00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:39.913 line:-2 align:center
so they are available
for all enrollment types.


266
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:43,250 line:-2
We have covered a lot,
from Configuration Profile Updates


267
00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:44.651 line:-1 align:center
to New Restrictions,


268
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,654 line:-2
but there's even more
management updates to discover.


269
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:52,025 line:-2
Now, let's take a look at the enhancements
we have made to Application management.


270
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,663 line:-2
Applications installed via MDM
have been supported for years.


271
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:59,666 line:-2
macOS Big Sur introduced
managed applications


272
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,736 line:-1
which support configuration and feedback,


273
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,872 line:-1
automatic removal on unenrollement,


274
00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:08.342 line:-2 align:center
and the ability to remove
the application via MDM.


275
00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:10.611 line:-2 align:center
Previously,
for an application to be manageable,


276
00:15:10.644 --> 00:15:13.113 line:-2 align:center
the package must contain
a single application


277
00:15:13.146 --> 00:15:15.883 line:-1 align:center
that is installed into /Applications.


278
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,619 line:-2
With macOS 14,
we are expanding that functionality


279
00:15:18.652 --> 00:15:20.454 line:-1 align:center
of the InstallApplication command


280
00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:23.924 line:-2 align:center
to allow the package to install
multiple Applications.


281
00:15:23.957 --> 00:15:26.793 line:-2 align:center
Any application the package installs
into /Applications


282
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:31,732 line:-2
will be considered managed,
and can be removed individually via MDM.


283
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,735 line:-2
Something to note,
content installed outside of /Applications


284
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,969 line:-1
will not be tracked,


285
00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:39.540 line:-2 align:center
so we strongly recommend
using self-contained applications.


286
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:43,377 line:-2
Wow, we have covered a lot
of awesome macOS updates,


287
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,913 line:-2
I am now going to hand it over to Patrick
to talk to you


288
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:49,249 line:-2
about some enhancements
coming to iOS and iPadOS.


289
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,684 line:-1
Take it away, Patrick.


290
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,320 line:-1
Patrick: Thank you, Jonathan.


291
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,722 line:-2
I'm delighted to cover
some exciting enhancements


292
00:15:55.756 --> 00:15:59.293 line:-2 align:center
we have made
to managing iOS and iPadOS devices.


293
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:03,297 line:-2
In many deployments, devices are handed
from one user to the next


294
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,566 line:-1
on a fairly frequent basis.


295
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:08,202 line:-1
Although devices can be erased remotely,


296
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:10,737 line:-2
getting them back into service
is a manual process,


297
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,040 line:-2
as it requires someone
to physically touch them


298
00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:15.542 line:-1 align:center
and take them through Setup Assistant.


299
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:18,145 line:-2
This year we are removing
the additional manual step


300
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:22,883 line:-2
with the introduction of Return to Service
for iOS and iPadOS.


301
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,451 line:-1
This is how it works:


302
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,255 line:-2
The MDM server sends
an Erase command to the device.


303
00:16:28.288 --> 00:16:30.424 line:-2 align:center
The command includes
additional information


304
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:34,661 line:-2
which allows the device to reset,
securely erase all data,


305
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:37,731 line:-1
connect to Wi-Fi, enroll into MDM,


306
00:16:37.764 --> 00:16:41.235 line:-2 align:center
and get back to the Home Screen,
ready to be used.


307
00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:43.070 line:-1 align:center
To implement this behavior,


308
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:46,740 line:-2
an additional dictionary can be added
to the EraseDevice command.


309
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:50,611 line:-2
This dictionary needs to include
the profile of a Wi-Fi configuration


310
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:53,647 line:-2
to allow the device to connect to,
once erased.


311
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.284 line:-2 align:center
As an alternative, the device can also
connect to the Internet


312
00:16:57.317 --> 00:17:00.087 line:-2 align:center
by different means,
like a tethered connection.


313
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,223 line:-2
Secondly,
the dictionary should include a profile


314
00:17:03.257 --> 00:17:05.826 line:-1 align:center
with the necessary enrollment information.


315
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,595 line:-2
In case the device is registered
in Apple School Manager


316
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:12,132 line:-2
or Apple Business Manager,
this profile can be omitted,


317
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:17,171 line:-2
which triggers the device to check for
an enrollment profile during activation.


318
00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:22.376 line:-2 align:center
As part of the process, the previously
selected language and region get applied.


319
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,646 line:-2
I now want to touch on
a couple of enhancements


320
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,484 line:-2
which we think will be specifically
relevant for educational organizations.


321
00:17:30.517 --> 00:17:33.954 line:-2 align:center
Getting a class started can be
a stressful process for the teacher.


322
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:37,357 line:-2
They have to ensure
everyone's signed in and ready to go.


323
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,394 line:-2
This is even more challenging
for larger classes.


324
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:43,530 line:-2
To make the process of signing in
easier and quicker,


325
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:46,533 line:-1
we are introducing easy student sign-in.


326
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,936 line:-1
To initiate the sign-in flow,


327
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:52,372 line:-2
the teacher needs to be signed into
their managed Apple ID.


328
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:55,375 line:-2
Additionally,
the student needs to have their iPad open


329
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,846 line:-2
to the iCloud sign-in view
within Settings.


330
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:00,714 line:-1
iPads are brought close to each other


331
00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:04.451 line:-2 align:center
and the teacher's iPad opens up
a sign-in proximity card.


332
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:08,222 line:-2
The teacher taps on
"Continue to Sign In Student."


333
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,226 line:-2
The proximity card transitions
to a camera scan on the teacher's iPad


334
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,263 line:-2
and the view on the student's iPad
changes to a particle cloud.


335
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,333 line:-1
The teacher then scans the particle cloud.


336
00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:23.036 line:-2 align:center
The teacher continues on
to the student selection process.


337
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,107 line:-2
The teacher can either select a class
to see the current student roster,


338
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:32.479 line:-2 align:center
or, they can instead use the search bar
to look up a student they had in mind.


339
00:18:32.513 --> 00:18:37.317 line:-2 align:center
In this illustration, the teacher taps
on the "Mathematics" class.


340
00:18:37.351 --> 00:18:40.787 line:-2 align:center
A list of students in the selected class
is appropriately shown.


341
00:18:40.821 --> 00:18:45.692 line:-2 align:center
The teacher then subsequently selects
Allison to sign in to the student iPad.


342
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:49,396 line:-2
After the iPad is set up,
the teacher gets a successful confirmation


343
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,666 line:-2
and the student iPad
is signed in successfully.


344
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,868 line:-1
To use the streamlined login process,


345
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:58,205 line:-2
multiple prerequisites
need to be in place.


346
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,574 line:-2
First, the teacher and student
need to be part


347
00:19:00.607 --> 00:19:03.477 line:-1 align:center
of the same Apple School Manager location.


348
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:08,382 line:-2
Second, both devices need to be
in physical proximity of each other.


349
00:19:08.415 --> 00:19:12.019 line:-2 align:center
And lastly, if the students are using
personal devices,


350
00:19:12.052 --> 00:19:14.788 line:-2 align:center
they first need to authorize the teacher
in a new prompt


351
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:17.591 line:-1 align:center
to enable this functionality.


352
00:19:17.624 --> 00:19:20.894 line:-2 align:center
We have also made it easier
to log into a Shared iPad.


353
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:23,530 line:-1
With the new AwaitUserConfiguration,


354
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:26,667 line:-2
an MDM solution can keep the device
in the login process


355
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.368 line:-1 align:center
after user authentication


356
00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:31.672 line:-2 align:center
until all necessary configurations
have been applied.


357
00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:34.408 line:-2 align:center
This is similar to a process
already available on devices


358
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,577 line:-1
using Automated Device Enrollment


359
00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:40.447 line:-2 align:center
and does require for the MDM server
to release the device from this state


360
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.250 line:-1 align:center
via a specific MDM command.


361
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,586 line:-1
To streamline the login flow even further,


362
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:50,324 line:-2
MDM solutions can make use of the new
'SkipLanguageAndLocaleSetupForNewUsers'


363
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:54,494 line:-2
key which prevents the device from showing
the respective selection screens


364
00:19:54.528 --> 00:19:59.433 line:-2 align:center
during the first log on,
and instead applies the system defaults.


365
00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:02.669 line:-2 align:center
In case a Shared iPad is used
by temporary users only,


366
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:06,974 line:-2
the device now honors the quota
configuration for this temporary user.


367
00:20:07.007 --> 00:20:11.745 line:-2 align:center
This allows IT administrators to reserve
sufficient space to assign new apps


368
00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:15.382 line:-1 align:center
and content while a user is logged in.


369
00:20:15.415 --> 00:20:18.485 line:-2 align:center
Now we shift gears and are going to look
at another key element


370
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:23,156 line:-2
of many iPhone and iPad deployments:
cellular connectivity.


371
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,626 line:-2
We know that many organizations
are looking forward to leverage


372
00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:30.964 line:-2 align:center
the great new capabilities that private
5G and LTE networks have to offer.


373
00:20:30.998 --> 00:20:34.568 line:-2 align:center
Common use cases include providing
network connectivity in large areas


374
00:20:34.601 --> 00:20:38.138 line:-2 align:center
where Wi-Fi may not be available
or feasible.


375
00:20:38.172 --> 00:20:42.276 line:-2 align:center
Since last year,
iPad devices have supported private LTE


376
00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:44.211 line:-1 align:center
and non-standalone 5G networks


377
00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:48.215 line:-2 align:center
with the ability to install eSIMs
through device management.


378
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,919 line:-2
We are adding the same features
to 5G-capable iPhone models


379
00:20:51.952 --> 00:20:57.558 line:-2 align:center
and on both platforms, the ability to
connect to private standalone 5G networks.


380
00:20:57.591 --> 00:21:00.027 line:-2 align:center
Searching and associating
with a private network


381
00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.097 line:-2 align:center
requires an active SIM
and can be an energy consuming task.


382
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:07,134 line:-2
Specifically,
when the network is not available.


383
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:10,437 line:-2
Thanks to our tight integration
of hardware and software,


384
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,040 line:-2
we were able to create
a power efficient method


385
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:15,609 line:-1
to enable the SIM only when needed.


386
00:21:15.642 --> 00:21:21.215 line:-2 align:center
This allows organizations to define a set
of geolocations that the device monitors,


387
00:21:21.248 --> 00:21:23.217 line:-1 align:center
and if it enters one of them,


388
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:27.221 line:-2 align:center
only then will the SIM
of the private network get activated.


389
00:21:27.254 --> 00:21:29.723 line:-1 align:center
Based on network quality measurements,


390
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,326 line:-2
iPhone and iPad devices
intelligently select


391
00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:35.329 line:-2 align:center
the best cellular SIM
for data connectivity.


392
00:21:35.362 --> 00:21:38.799 line:-2 align:center
As an optional value,
an organization can also define


393
00:21:38.832 --> 00:21:41.335 line:-1 align:center
that a device prefers the private network


394
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:45,506 line:-2
even over a potentially available
Wi-Fi network.


395
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,009 line:-2
We are also adding
5G network slicing support.


396
00:21:49.042 --> 00:21:52.980 line:-2 align:center
This allows individual managed apps
to be assigned to a network slice


397
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:55,883 line:-2
which may provide specific
network capabilities


398
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:59,486 line:-2
and characteristics
to optimize the app experience.


399
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,924 line:-2
The assignment is done using the new
CellularSliceUUID app attribute


400
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:10,030 line:-2
in either the MDM app installation command
or declarative app configuration.


401
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:13,200 line:-2
The string value of the network slice
to put into the key


402
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:16,537 line:-2
needs to be provided
by the supporting carrier.


403
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,107 line:-2
Something to note is that 5G network
slicing will not be used


404
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:25.646 line:-2 align:center
if either the specific app or the entire
device is configured to use a VPN.


405
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,348 line:-1
To conclude our updates on connectivity,


406
00:22:28.382 --> 00:22:32.152 line:-2 align:center
I'm excited to make you aware
of a new way to provide secure access


407
00:22:32.186 --> 00:22:34.254 line:-1 align:center
to enterprise network resources:


408
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:36,190 line:-1
relays.


409
00:22:36.223 --> 00:22:40.093 line:-2 align:center
Relays are secure proxies
that are natively supported on iOS,


410
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:43,197 line:-1
iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS.


411
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,700 line:-2
If you're using a VPN
to access your enterprise resources,


412
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:50,270 line:-2
relays are an alternative that can provide
a better user experience


413
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:52,339 line:-1
and are easier to manage.


414
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:56,410 line:-2
Relays can be configured by an MDM
with a new profile payload type,


415
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,345 line:-1
without needing to install an app,


416
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,915 line:-2
or can be configured
using the NERelayManager API


417
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:04,918 line:-1
in the NetworkExtension framework.


418
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:08,822 line:-2
These configurations can apply
to managed apps, domains,


419
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:10,691 line:-1
or the entire device,


420
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,694 line:-2
and can be used in conjunction
with iCloud Private Relay


421
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:18,098 line:-2
to enhance user privacy
while accessing enterprise resources.


422
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:22,202 line:0
To learn more about this great new
built-in way to secure your traffic,


423
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:25,072 line:0
please watch session "Ready, set, relay:


424
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:28,308 line:0
Protect app traffic with network relays."


425
00:23:28.342 --> 00:23:30.777 line:-2 align:center
There are many more
new configuration possibilities


426
00:23:30.811 --> 00:23:34.948 line:-2 align:center
like requiring a minimum version
during automated device enrollment.


427
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:37,451 line:-1
In addition to the ones common with macOS,


428
00:23:37.484 --> 00:23:40.220 line:-2 align:center
there are also
some platform-specific enhancements


429
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:45,659 line:-2
like configuring 802.1X authentication
for ethernet networks on iOS,


430
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:48,629 line:-1
iPadOS, and even tvOS


431
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:54,468 line:-2
and allowing tap-to-pay applications
to be used more easily and securely.


432
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:57.271 line:-1 align:center
Just as a reminder, in a future release,


433
00:23:57.304 --> 00:24:00.908 line:-2 align:center
we will execute on
previously announced deprecations.


434
00:24:00.941 --> 00:24:05.345 line:-2 align:center
We will remove the APN payload,
as well as top-level cellular keys


435
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,748 line:-1
from the DeviceInformation query.


436
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,918 line:-1
Please use the com.apple.cellular payload


437
00:24:10.951 --> 00:24:14.254 line:-1 align:center
and ServiceSubscriptions response instead.


438
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:17,491 line:-2
Again, in a future release
we will also change


439
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:20,661 line:-2
the listed restrictions
to require supervision.


440
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:24,198 line:-2
In addition, some will only apply
to a personal Apple ID


441
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:26,200 line:-1
logged in on the device.


442
00:24:26.233 --> 00:24:29.336 line:-2 align:center
There is even more
I haven't had a chance to talk about,


443
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:32,406 line:-1
like added VPN support on Apple TV.


444
00:24:32.439 --> 00:24:36.176 line:-2 align:center
Please be sure to check out
the documentation for all the details.


445
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,314 line:-2
We additionally have exciting news
about Apple Configurator for iPhone.


446
00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:42,082 line:-1
Since its introduction,


447
00:24:42.115 --> 00:24:45.919 line:-2 align:center
Apple Configurator for iPhone
has been used by many IT administrators


448
00:24:45.953 --> 00:24:48.188 line:-2 align:center
to add devices
to their Apple School Manager


449
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:51,658 line:-1
or Apple Business Manager organizations.


450
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:54,561 line:-1
Adding a device is a two-step process.


451
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:58,065 line:-2
First, the device needs to be added
to the organization.


452
00:24:59.566 --> 00:25:03.203 line:-2 align:center
Secondly, a user with the role
of Device Enrollment Manager


453
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:05,038 line:-1
needs to sign in to the web portal


454
00:25:05.072 --> 00:25:08.242 line:-2 align:center
and assign the device
to the correct MDM server.


455
00:25:08.275 --> 00:25:12.312 line:-2 align:center
This year, we are allowing users
to automatically assign each device


456
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:16,350 line:-2
to an MDM server
right in Apple Configurator.


457
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:20,754 line:-2
The user has three options to choose from
for assigning devices;


458
00:25:20.787 --> 00:25:23.590 line:-1 align:center
don't assign to an MDM server,


459
00:25:23.624 --> 00:25:27.294 line:-2 align:center
assign to the default MDM server
configured for its type,


460
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:30,464 line:-1
for example Mac or iPad,


461
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:34,001 line:-2
or assign to one
of the organization's MDM servers.


462
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:37,571 line:-2
The list of available MDM servers
is provided automatically


463
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:40,807 line:-2
after the user signs in
with their Managed Apple ID.


464
00:25:40.841 --> 00:25:43.944 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a look at Apple Configurator
for Mac as well.


465
00:25:43.977 --> 00:25:47.948 line:-2 align:center
It's a great tool for configuring
iOS and iPadOS devices


466
00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:52.352 line:-2 align:center
and helps perform actions
on multiple tethered devices at once.


467
00:25:52.386 --> 00:25:55.556 line:-2 align:center
This year we are making those workflows
even more automated


468
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:58,225 line:-1
with the addition of Shortcut actions.


469
00:25:58,258 --> 00:26:02,729 line:-2
Using Shortcuts, IT administrators
can build powerful custom shortcuts


470
00:26:02.763 --> 00:26:05.232 line:-1 align:center
with Apple Configurator's actions.


471
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:08,135 line:-2
We are adding Shortcut actions
to update, restore,


472
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:11,405 line:-2
erase, and prepare
iPhone and iPad devices.


473
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:15,943 line:-2
Shortcuts can be triggered to run
when a device attaches or detaches.


474
00:26:15.976 --> 00:26:19.513 line:-2 align:center
If you combine those additions
with actions an MDM provides,


475
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:23,483 line:-2
you will have a very powerful
automation toolbox.


476
00:26:23.517 --> 00:26:25.786 line:-2 align:center
Let's look at an example
of a simple shortcut


477
00:26:25.819 --> 00:26:28.455 line:-1 align:center
that leverages Apple Configurator actions.


478
00:26:28.488 --> 00:26:32.559 line:-2 align:center
Here, we see a basic shortcut
for provisioning an iPad.


479
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:38,198 line:-2
First, we reset the device
and install the latest version of iPadOS.


480
00:26:38.232 --> 00:26:40.801 line:-2 align:center
The device then uses
Automated Device Enrollment


481
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:45,472 line:-2
to enroll in MDM and can take the device
completely through Setup Assistant,


482
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:48,208 line:-1
eventually landing it on the Home Screen.


483
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:50,577 line:-2
Because the Mac is sharing
its internet connection


484
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,980 line:-1
and has content caching enabled,


485
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:58,018 line:-2
commands are received from the MDM server
and apps begin to install quickly.


486
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:01,054 line:-2
Once done,
the shortcut updates the MDM server


487
00:27:01.088 --> 00:27:05.692 line:-2 align:center
with the asset tag number
from a separate csv file.


488
00:27:05.726 --> 00:27:07.394 line:-1 align:center
Once you perfect your shortcut,


489
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:10,430 line:-2
you can use new Shortcuts settings
in Apple Configurator


490
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:14,968 line:-2
to run it every time
you attach or detach a device.


491
00:27:15.002 --> 00:27:16.937 line:-1 align:center
If you're an MDM developer,


492
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,008 line:-2
we think it's important to provide
easy integration with Shortcuts.


493
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:24,244 line:-2
Your customers will want to easily
interact with your MDM server


494
00:27:24.278 --> 00:27:27.347 line:-2 align:center
to send commands
from your product to the device.


495
00:27:27.381 --> 00:27:30.751 line:-2 align:center
They will also want to send information,
like an asset tag number,


496
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:34,154 line:-2
back to your product
to update a device's information.


497
00:27:34.188 --> 00:27:38.091 line:-2 align:center
We can't wait to see what you will do
with the new possibilities!


498
00:27:38.125 --> 00:27:42.629 line:-2 align:center
This concludes our updates
on iOS and iPadOS.


499
00:27:42.663 --> 00:27:45.199 line:-2 align:center
We've covered many enhancements
during this session,


500
00:27:45.232 --> 00:27:47.768 line:-1 align:center
so let's take a moment to recap.


501
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:49,436 line:-1
As Jonathan has mentioned,


502
00:27:49.469 --> 00:27:52.139 line:-2 align:center
macOS provides new options to
organizations


503
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:55,008 line:-2
to ensure devices are in
the desired state.


504
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:59,079 line:-2
We also covered great new ways
to create and manage local user accounts


505
00:27:59.112 --> 00:28:01.081 line:-1 align:center
based on your identity system.


506
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:03,684 line:-2
Managed Device Attestation
comes to the Mac


507
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:07,354 line:-2
and gets additional attributes
on all supported platforms.


508
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:12,259 line:-2
And for iOS we have looked at an easy way
to put a device back into service


509
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:16,330 line:-2
and great enhancements
to classroom setups and Shared iPad.


510
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:19,733 line:-2
We also spoke about increased support
of private cellular networks


511
00:28:19.766 --> 00:28:22.102 line:-1 align:center
on both iPhone and iPad.


512
00:28:22.135 --> 00:28:25.405 line:-2 align:center
We additionally looked at how
Apple Configurator streamlines the process


513
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:27,140 line:-1
of registering devices,


514
00:28:27,174 --> 00:28:30,644 line:-2
and its new options
to create powerful automations.


515
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:34,348 line:-2
We can't wait for you to use
the great new management capabilities,


516
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:36.750 line:-1 align:center
and we look forward to your feedback.


517
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:39,052 line:-1
Thank you very much for joining us.
