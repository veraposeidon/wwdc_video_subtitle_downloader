Michael: Hello and welcome.


4
00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.214 line:-2 align:center
I'm Michael Ochs and in this video
I'm going to talk about


5
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:17,985 line:-1
how to build better document-centric apps.


6
00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.054 line:-2 align:center
Document-centric apps are
a big part of productivity tools,


7
00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.090 line:-1 align:center
especially on the iPad.


8
00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.426 line:-2 align:center
There are three types
of document-centric apps.


9
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.831 line:-2 align:center
Those that allow browsing documents,
such as the Files app;


10
00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:34.501 line:-2 align:center
those that allow viewing content,
for example Quick Look;


11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:38,005 line:-2
and those that also allow editing
or creating content,


12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,009 line:-1
like Pages, Keynote, or Numbers.


13
00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.679 line:-2 align:center
This video focuses on improvements
to viewer and editor apps,


14
00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:50.751 line:-2 align:center
but some of the content discussed
also applies to browser apps.

iPadOS 17 introduces a new view controller
that automatically enables


16
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,058 line:-1
a large number of features in your app.


17
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,128 line:-2
It works nicely together
with the desktop-class iPad APIs


18
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,163 line:-1
introduced in iPadOS 16,


19
00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:07.000 line:-1 align:center
and the existing document-centric APIs.


20
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:10,170 line:-2
This new view controller
is built in a modular way.


21
00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:14.842 line:-2 align:center
You get great system defaults,
but can customize any individual behavior.


22
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,179 line:0
To catch up on desktop-class iPad APIs,


23
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,315 line:0
check out 'Meet desktop-class iPad'


24
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:25,786 align:center
and 'Build a desktop-class iPad app'
from WWDC22.


25
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,791 align:center
For SwiftUI development,
DocumentGroup now has support


26
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,127 align:center
for all these features
with no additional code.


27
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,430 line:0
To learn more
about the SwiftUI side of this,


28
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:41,101 align:center

in SwiftUI' from WWDC20


29
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:48,675 align:center

titles, and more' from WWDC22.


30
00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.211 line:-1 align:center
In UIKit the functionality is opt-in.


31
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:56,383 line:-2
UIDocumentViewController is a new
base class for content view controllers.


32
00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.352 line:-1 align:center
It works together with UIDocument


33
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,255 line:-2
to automatically configure
the navigation bar.


34
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,658 line:-2
This enables features like sharing,
dragging the document,


35
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.027 line:-1 align:center
undo and redo support, and more.


36
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.464 line:-1 align:center
It also supports automatic renaming.


37
00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.600 line:-2 align:center
In this video,
you will learn how to use UIDocument


38
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:18,472 line:-2
and how to present documents
with UIDocumentViewController.


39
00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.908 line:-2 align:center
I'll then explain
which features are built-in,


40
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:24,478 line:-1
and how to customize them further.


41
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,215 line:-2
At the end I explore some best practices
to migrate your existing apps


42
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:32,052 line:-1
to take advantage of UIDocument.


43
00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.421 line:-1 align:center
First up, creating a document.


44
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.093 line:-2 align:center
The core of every document based app
is UIDocument.


45
00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:43.096 line:-2 align:center
It's an abstract base class
that is meant to be subclassed


46
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.900 line:-1 align:center
for each file-type that your app supports.


47
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,570 line:-1
All UIDocuments are backed by a URL.


48
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,271 line:-1
Files on disk are the most common,


49
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,241 line:-2
but you can also save and load
your documents using a database


50
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,578 line:-1
and a custom URL scheme.


51
00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:00.514 line:-2 align:center
UIDocument's load and save operations
are asynchronous,


52
00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:04.384 line:-2 align:center
which allows for lengthy
read and write operations, if necessary.


53
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,787 line:-2
For this reason,
UIDocument is thread safe


54
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,390 line:-2
and takes care of coordinating access
through locks and queues.


55
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,895 line:-1
When implementing a UIDocument subclass,


56
00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:18.565 line:-2 align:center
there are two main responsibilities
to take care of:


57
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,834 line:-1
loading and saving of the document,


58
00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:25.105 line:-2 align:center
and providing access
to the content of the document.


59
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:29,309 line:-2
Loading and saving is very similar
across all documents.


60
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:32,479 line:-2
Accessing the content is more specific
to the type of document


61
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,282 line:-1
and how it is used in your app.


62
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,085 line:-2
For example,
a document model for a markdown editor


63
00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:40.487 line:-1 align:center
might only have a single text property;


64
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:43,257 line:-2
or it could expose
a more complex interface


65
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,661 line:-2
that allows updating individual parts
of the document.


66
00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.397 line:-2 align:center
Before we talk more
about accessing the content,


67
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,133 line:-1
let's talk about loading and saving.


68
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,469 line:-1
For simple, file based documents,


69
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,438 line:-2
there are two convenience methods
you can override.


70
00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:01.808 line:-2 align:center
When a document gets opened,
'loadFromContents:ofType:'


71
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,112 line:-2
will be called
with the contents of the file.


72
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,147 line:-1
When the document is being saved,


73
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:12.386 line:-2 align:center
'contentsForType:' is called to get
the current content of the document.


74
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,856 line:-2
The content of the document
is a Data object for regular files,


75
00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.092 line:-1 align:center
or a FileWrapper for everything else.


76
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,728 line:-3
To learn more about file types
and how they work,


77
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,663 line:-2
check out the Tech Talk


78
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:26,500 line:-3
'Uniform Type Identifiers --
a reintroduction'.


79
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,736 line:-3
For example here, the document
deals with regular markdown files,


80
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,506 line:-2
so we expect a data object.


81
00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.944 line:-2 align:center
Now, if you want total control,
overriding 'saveToURL:forSaveOperation:'


82
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,647 line:-2
and 'readFromURL:' instead
gives you full access to the URL


83
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:43,750 line:-1
and leaves all reading and writing to you.


84
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,854 line:-2
This is great if you want to store
your documents in a database


85
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:51,525 line:-2
or have special requirements
for reading and writing your document.


86
00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.961 line:-2 align:center
Note that while the save operation
is asynchronous,


87
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:58,498 line:-2
reading is expected to complete
by the time the method returns.


88
00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:02.202 line:-2 align:center
And this is all there is
to loading and saving a document.


89
00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:06.940 line:-2 align:center
Now let's make sure we have a way
to access the content of the document.


90
00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:09.910 line:-2 align:center
An easy way to provide access
to the document's content


91
00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:12.579 line:-1 align:center
is by adding properties for that content.


92
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:15,549 line:-2
In this example,
I add a single text property


93
00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:18.852 line:-1 align:center
that contains the full markdown string.


94
00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:22.155 line:-2 align:center
This property will be set
when loading the document initially,


95
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,725 line:-1
as discussed on the previous slides.


96
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,426 line:-1
The app can then update this text


97
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,530 line:-1
whenever the user edits the document.


98
00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:33.033 line:-2 align:center
For UIDocument to know
when it requires saving,


99
00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:37.905 line:-2 align:center
call 'updateChangeCount:'
every time a property updates.


100
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:41,441 line:-2
Calling 'updateChangeCount:' allows
UIDocument to mark the document


101
00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:45.345 line:-2 align:center
as needs-saving and automatically
save at appropriate times.


102
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:52,119 line:-2
Next, presenting a document
with the new UIDocumentViewController.


103
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,589 line:-1
Similar to UIDocument,


104
00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:58.959 line:-2 align:center
UIDocumentViewController
also is an abstract base class


105
00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:01.662 line:-1 align:center
that is meant to be subclassed.


106
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.865 line:-2 align:center
It manages opening,
saving, and closing the document


107
00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:10.704 line:-2 align:center
and populates its navigation item with
information from its associated document.


108
00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:13.807 line:-2 align:center
This includes the title,
the navigation item's title menu,


109
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:18,445 line:-2
its UIDocumentProperties object,
and the rename delegate.


110
00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:22.216 line:-2 align:center
UIDocumentViewController also provides
key-commands for common actions


111
00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:24.785 line:-1 align:center
like undo and redo.


112
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:28,956 line:-2
Let's check out how to implement
a UIDocumentViewController subclass.


113
00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:33.927 line:-2 align:center
There are two methods that are designed
to be overridden by your subclass.


114
00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:36.997 line:-2 align:center
When the document associated
with the view controller gets opened,


115
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,801 line:-2
or when an already opened document
gets assigned to the view controller,


116
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,403 line:-1
'documentDidOpen' is called.


117
00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:46.907 line:-2 align:center
Populate the view controller's views
to display the content of the document


118
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.343 line:-1 align:center
in this method.


119
00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:51.311 line:-1 align:center
Note that there's no timing guarantee


120
00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:53.313 line:-1 align:center
between when 'documentDidOpen' is called


121
00:06:53.347 --> 00:06:56.550 line:-2 align:center
and when the view controller's view
gets loaded.


122
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,254 line:-2
A good approach to write robust code
is to move the view configuration


123
00:07:00.287 --> 00:07:02.389 line:-1 align:center
in its own method and call it from both,


124
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,959 line:-2
'documentDidOpen'
as well as 'viewDidLoad'.


125
00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:08.829 line:-2 align:center
Check if the view is loaded
and the document is opened,


126
00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:10.898 line:-1 align:center
before configuring your views.


127
00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:17.604 line:-2 align:center
The second method to override
is 'navigationItemDidUpdate'.


128
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:21,642 line:-2
Whenever UIDocumentViewController
makes changes to the navigation item,


129
00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:24.311 line:-1 align:center
it will call this method.


130
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,714 line:-2
Add your navigation item customization
in there.


131
00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:30.417 line:-2 align:center
'UIDocumentViewController'
will make a best effort


132
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,522 line:-2
to keep changes to a minimum to persist
your changes as best as possible.


133
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:39,960 line:-2
UIDocumentViewController also offers
a 'undoRedoItemGroup'.


134
00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:43.830 line:-2 align:center
Put this group in the navigation bar if
you want undo and redo buttons to appear,


135
00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:47.968 line:-2 align:center
and make sure that your document
has an undo manager assigned to it.


136
00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:51.438 line:-2 align:center
UIDocumentViewController will change
the 'hidden' property of this group


137
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,141 line:-2
depending on the availability
of an undo manager


138
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:57,911 line:-2
and enable or disable the buttons
inside the group as necessary.


139
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:03,951 line:-2
UIDocumentViewController automatically
opens and closes the document.


140
00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:07.387 line:-2 align:center
However if you need access to the document
from outside the view controller,


141
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:11,291 line:-1
call 'openDocumentWithCompletionHandler'.


142
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,528 line:-2
UIDocumentViewController will make
all the necessary callbacks,


143
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,663 line:-1
such as calling 'documentDidOpen'


144
00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:18.999 line:-2 align:center
and call your completion handler
when ready.


145
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,171 line:-2
Last but not least,
UIDocumentViewController


146
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,440 line:-1
provides a document property.


147
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:29,643 line:-2
This property always refers to
the document associated


148
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.979 line:-1 align:center
with the view controller.


149
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,548 line:-2
While you can provide a document
during initialization,


150
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,617 line:-1
it is entirely optional.


151
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,419 line:-2
When there is no document
associated with the view controller,


152
00:08:39.453 --> 00:08:42.756 line:-1 align:center
it will automatically show an empty state.


153
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,725 line:0
To learn more
about configuring empty states,


154
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,861 align:center
check out "What's new in UIKit".


155
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:53,166 line:-2
Furthermore, UIDocumentViewController can
be used as your app’s root view controller.


156
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,702 line:-2
If there is no browser view controller
in the hierarchy,


157
00:08:55.736 --> 00:08:59.306 line:-2 align:center
UIDocumentViewController puts
a document button in the navigation bar


158
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,343 line:-1
that opens a document picker.


159
00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:06.413 line:-2 align:center
This requires declaring the key
'UIDocumentClass'


160
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,316 line:-2
for the relevant file type
in your app's info.plist


161
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:13,086 line:-2
and setting it to the UIDocument subclass
matching that file type.


162
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:20,661 line:-2
In iPadOS 17, UIDocument conforms
to 'UINavigationItemRenameDelegate'


163
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,397 line:-2
and will handle
the underlying file changes by itself


164
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.067 line:-2 align:center
when the user invokes renaming
from the title menu.


165
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.102 line:-1 align:center
If you are using UIDocumentViewController,


166
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,738 line:-2
it will automatically
configure renaming for you,


167
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,507 line:-1
otherwise you can set the document


168
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.777 line:-2 align:center
as the navigation item's
rename delegate manually.


169
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,849 line:-2
These are all the pieces you need
to create a great document-centric app


170
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,684 line:-1
in iPadOS 17.


171
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,720 line:-1
Next, how to migrate your existing apps.


172
00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:52.659 line:-2 align:center
Migrating your app to make use of
the new UIDocumentViewController is easy


173
00:09:52.693 --> 00:09:55.562 line:-1 align:center
and only requires three steps.


174
00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:59.499 line:-2 align:center
First, update the base class
of your content view controller.


175
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:03,971 line:-2
Second,
move existing code to the new callbacks.


176
00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:08.642 line:-2 align:center
And third,
delete code that is no longer necessary.


177
00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:11.812 line:-2 align:center
Let's check out how to convert
the markdown editor example


178
00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:15.048 line:-2 align:center
we use
in the desktop-class iPad app videos.


179
00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:17.584 line:-2 align:center
If you are not familiar with it,
don't worry.


180
00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:20.954 line:-2 align:center
I'll walk you through the relevant parts
of the existing code first.


181
00:10:22.189 --> 00:10:25.826 line:-2 align:center
So here we have the definition
of the view controller at the top,


182
00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:28.295 line:-1 align:center
the document property it defines,


183
00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:31.031 line:-2 align:center
and an init method
that sets the initial document


184
00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:33.534 line:-1 align:center
and then adds a callback to our document.


185
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:39,573 line:-2
First we change the base class
to UIDocumentViewController.


186
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:44,478 line:-2
Now that this class inherits
from UIDocumentViewController,


187
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,481 line:-2
we will get a compiler error
because the property 'document'


188
00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:52.019 line:-2 align:center
already exists in the superclass
with a different type.


189
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,922 line:-2
We change the name of that property
to a more specific one,


190
00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:57.558 line:-1 align:center
like 'markdownDocument'.


191
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:01,828 line:-2
Then we make it a computed property
that casts the generic document property


192
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:06,266 line:-2
to the specific document class
used in this view controller.


193
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.803 line:-2 align:center
The last bit in this code to take care of
is the initializer.


194
00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:15.242 line:-2 align:center
The only code in there that we still need
is assigning a callback to our document.


195
00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:18.946 line:-2 align:center
Since the document can change during
the lifetime of this view controller,


196
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:22,349 line:-2
we move this to execute every time
the document changes.


197
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:27.287 line:-2 align:center
An easy way to do this
is to override the document property


198
00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:29.890 line:-1 align:center
and add a didSet callback.


199
00:11:29.923 --> 00:11:32.326 line:-2 align:center
Great,
now that the base class is up to date,


200
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,897 line:-1
we need to take care of the new callbacks.


201
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,433 line:-2
In 'viewDidLoad' we add buttons
to our navigation bar


202
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,803 line:-2
and configure it
to allow toolbar customization.


203
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,304 line:-1
For UIDocumentViewController


204
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:47,774 line:-2
we move this to the new callback
'navigationItemDidUpdate'.


205
00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:54.982 line:-2 align:center
Next, our class already has a method
'didOpenDocument'.


206
00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:58.118 line:-2 align:center
This is almost what
UIDocumentViewController has as well.


207
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,853 line:-1
We just need to rename the method,


208
00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:03.156 line:-2 align:center
and adjust for the fact
that the document is now optional.


209
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:08,262 line:-2
All right,
next the part that we all enjoy most:


210
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,197 line:-1
deleting code.


211
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,102 line:-2
Editor view controller conforms
to 'UINavigationItemRenameDelegate',


212
00:12:15.135 --> 00:12:16.970 line:-1 align:center
but we no longer need that.


213
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:20,307 line:-2
UIDocument does all renaming for us
automatically.


214
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.910 line:-1 align:center
So we remove the delegate definition,


215
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,212 line:-1
the delegate method with all its code,


216
00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:28.182 line:-1 align:center
and also the 'renameDelegate' assignment.


217
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:35,355 line:-2
Next we can remove a few more
navigationItem customizations.


218
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,858 line:-2
Both 'style' and 'backAction'
are configured


219
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,893 line:-2
by the document view controller
automatically,


220
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,563 line:-1
so we can get rid of this completely.


221
00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:46.867 line:-2 align:center
There is also
a 'updateDocumentProperties' method


222
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,371 line:-2
that is used to create
a UIDocumentProperties object.


223
00:12:51.405 --> 00:12:53.707 line:-1 align:center
This method is called from various places.


224
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.609 line:-1 align:center
However, we don't need it anymore.


225
00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:59.379 line:-2 align:center
UIDocumentViewController
is doing all of this for us,


226
00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:03.350 line:-2 align:center
so we can remove it
and all its call sites.


227
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,052 line:-1
And that's all there is to do.


228
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,088 line:-2
The editor view controller is now
only taking care of the features


229
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,790 line:-1
that are unique to the app.


230
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,727 line:-2
It no longer has to manage basic tasks
of document management


231
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.830 line:-2 align:center
or default configuration
of the navigation bar.


232
00:13:16.864 --> 00:13:22.269 line:-2 align:center
Instead you can focus on the pieces
that are unique, key elements of your app.


233
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,339 line:-2
This is all you need to know
to take your document-centric apps


234
00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:29.042 line:-2 align:center
to the next level and provide your users
with a great experience.


235
00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:33.680 line:-2 align:center
Convert your data models
to use UIDocument.


236
00:13:33.714 --> 00:13:35.782 line:-1 align:center
Then convert your content view controller


237
00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:39.853 line:-2 align:center
to use the new
UIDocumentViewController base class.


238
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,055 line:-2
After that,
go through your view controller


239
00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:46.293 line:-2 align:center
and remove all the code
that's no longer needed.


240
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,961 line:-1
Thanks for watching.
