Jonathan: Hi, I'm Jonathan,


4
00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.849 line:-2 align:center
and I'm an engineer
on the Internet Technologies team.


5
00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:20.521 line:-2 align:center
Today we'll explore how to build
robust and resumable file transfers


6
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:23,257 line:-1
using URLSession.


7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,093 line:-2
Large file transfers can be
a huge challenge


8
00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:30.564 line:-2 align:center
because even a tiny interruption
can throw away all your user's progress


9
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,567 line:-2
and force them to start
from the very beginning.


10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.036 line:-1 align:center
Plus, the larger the transfer,


11
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:39,072 line:-2
the longer it takes,
and the longer it takes,


12
00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:42.776 line:-2 align:center
the more opportunity there is
for something to go wrong.


13
00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:48.615 line:-2 align:center
In that time, your user might
navigate away from your app,


14
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,617 line:-1
leave the range of Wi-Fi,


15
00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:56.123 line:-2 align:center
or experience one of so many
network problems outside of their control.


16
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,826 line:-2
In this session, we'll explore
how to solve these challenges


17
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.364 line:-2 align:center
and provide a robust
networking experience for your users.


18
00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:08.435 line:-2 align:center
Our first stop
is resumable HTTP protocols,


19
00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.938 line:-2 align:center
which allow your user
to keep their progress


20
00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.574 line:-1 align:center
when a connection is interrupted.


21
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,476 line:-1
This prevents wasted time and bandwidth,


22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,015 line:-2
making these protocols a powerful tool
when transferring large amounts of data.


23
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,087 line:-2
I'll demonstrate how to resume both
downloads and uploads in URLSession,


24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,892 line:-2
including brand new APIs
for resumable upload tasks.


25
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:36.029 line:-2 align:center
Understanding the mechanism
behind these APIs can be really helpful


26
00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:40.400 line:-2 align:center
for debugging your app,
or even building your own server support.


27
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,204 line:-2
That's why we'll also cover
the resumable protocols themselves,


28
00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:49.142 line:-2 align:center
so you know exactly how your app
and server achieve this over HTTP.


29
00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:53.146 line:-1 align:center
Next up, speaking of servers,


30
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.485 line:-2 align:center
you'll learn how to bring resumable upload
support to any server that uses SwiftNIO.


31
00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:03.557 line:-2 align:center
And lastly,
we'll review how background URLSessions


32
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.294 line:-2 align:center
can gracefully handle
user and network interruptions,


33
00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:10.197 line:-2 align:center
while making efficient use
of system resources.


34
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:16,436 line:-2
Let's learn more about download
and upload resumption in URLSession.


35
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.473 line:-1 align:center
So I'm downloading the latest Xcode,


36
00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:23.043 line:-2 align:center
and the 7 gigabyte download
is almost finished.


37
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,913 line:-1
Right at the end, my Wi-Fi goes out.


38
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,583 line:-1
But wait, the download is paused,


39
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,753 line:-1
and when the Wi-Fi comes back online,


40
00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.689 line:-2 align:center
I can resume my download
from where it left off.


41
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:42,196 line:-2
I just saved lots of time
and several gigs of bandwidth.


42
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:44.398 line:-1 align:center
Resumable downloads are amazing.


43
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:47.167 line:-1 align:center
But how do they work?


44
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:52.072 line:-2 align:center
First, the client sends a GET request
to retrieve the download from the server.


45
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.844 line:-2 align:center
In the response,
the server advertises its support


46
00:02:56,877 --> 00:03:01,415 line:-2
for resumable downloads
using the Accept-Ranges header.


47
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:05,586 line:-2
Accept-Ranges: bytes means
the server supports range requests


48
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:09,256 line:-1
for specific bytes of this resource.


49
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,893 line:-2
The server response also contains
what's called an ETag,


50
00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:17.631 line:-2 align:center
which uniquely identifies the resource
at this moment in time.


51
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,502 line:-2
If the content on the server changes,
the ETag does, too.


52
00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:25.706 line:-2 align:center
So what happens
if this download is interrupted?


53
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.910 line:-2 align:center
The client has stored
the partial download data,


54
00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.779 line:-1 align:center
so it only needs the last part.


55
00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:36.049 line:-2 align:center
To accomplish this,
it can send a range request


56
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,520 line:-2
to retrieve the missing bytes
of the download.


57
00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:44.191 line:-2 align:center
The request indicates which bytes
using the Range field.


58
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:49.029 line:-2 align:center
But the client also needs to make sure
the resource hasn't changed,


59
00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:52.199 line:-2 align:center
or else it would be appending data
from the new resource


60
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,736 line:-1
onto the older resource that's stored.


61
00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.274 line:-2 align:center
To prevent this, the If-Range field
contains the ETag received


62
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,142 line:-1
from the previous response,


63
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,713 line:-2
telling the server to only send
the partial data if the ETag is the same.


64
00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.185 line:-1 align:center
If the ETag is the same,


65
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:15,923 line:-2
then the server responds
with 206 Partial Content.


66
00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:19.293 line:-2 align:center
The Content-Range field here
denotes the range of bytes


67
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:23,130 line:-2
included in this response,
completing the download.


68
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,835 line:-2
Since the beginning,
URLSession has offered API


69
00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:32.206 line:-2 align:center
to pause and resume download tasks
using Range requests.


70
00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:35.742 line:-2 align:center
Now,
you can pause and resume uploads, too.


71
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:40,514 line:-2
Not only does this allow you
to manually pause an ongoing task,


72
00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:45.752 line:-2 align:center
but you can also perform error handling to
recover from unexpected connection issues


73
00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:49.857 line:-2 align:center
and resume your transfer
right where it left off.


74
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.560 line:-2 align:center
Let's review how this works
for downloads first.


75
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:57,698 line:-2
Imagine you're creating a UI
that allow users to manually pause


76
00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:00.067 line:-1 align:center
and resume their downloads.


77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,035 line:-1
Like the Safari example,


78
00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.472 line:-1 align:center
your app owns this UI, but under the hood,


79
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:08,775 line:-2
you can use URLSession
to handle all the details,


80
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:14.515 line:-2 align:center
like keeping track of the partial download
data, ETag, and request headers.


81
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:18,185 line:-2
To begin a download,
you create a download task like usual,


82
00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:21.455 line:-1 align:center
and start it by calling resume.


83
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,792 line:-2
To pause the download,
such as when a user taps a pause button,


84
00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:30.264 line:-1 align:center
you can call cancelByProducingResumeData.


85
00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:32.566 line:-1 align:center
In order to resume this download later,


86
00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.370 line:-2 align:center
URLSession will need information
about the partial download,


87
00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:41.308 line:-2 align:center
like its ETag, current size,
and location on disk.


88
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:43.477 line:-1 align:center
This, and other metadata,


89
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.383 line:-2 align:center
are conveniently stored in the resume
data object returned from this function.


90
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,953 line:-2
Again, it's important to note
that this resume data


91
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,756 line:-1
is not the partial download data.


92
00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.758 line:-1 align:center
If the resume data is nil,


93
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:03,063 line:-2
this means that one or more requirements
for resumable downloads are not met,


94
00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:05.299 line:-1 align:center
which we'll cover soon.


95
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,502 line:-2
On the other hand,
if the resume data is not nil,


96
00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.672 line:-1 align:center
you should store it for later use.


97
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.241 line:-1 align:center
That's because to resume the download,


98
00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:17.010 line:-1 align:center
like when a user taps a resume button,


99
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:22,216 line:-2
you pass this stored data to
the downloadTask withResumeData method.


100
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,685 line:-1
It's as simple as that!


101
00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:28.021 line:-2 align:center
This pattern is great
for manually pausing a download,


102
00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:33.193 line:-2 align:center
but URLSession also offers ways to recover
from unpredicted connection interruptions.


103
00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:38.432 line:-2 align:center
If your download task fails
due to a network problem,


104
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:42,169 line:-2
you can check for resume data
in the error itself.


105
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,171 line:-1
If the download can be resumed,


106
00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:49.243 line:-2 align:center
the error's userInfo dictionary
will contain that resume data.


107
00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:51.712 line:-1 align:center
You can conveniently access this data


108
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:56,783 line:-2
using the downloadTaskResumeData
property of URLError.


109
00:06:56,817 --> 00:07:02,155 line:-2
There are a few requirements for
resumable downloads in URLSession.


110
00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:06.026 line:-2 align:center
Downloads inherently fetch data,
and should be safe to repeat,


111
00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:12.065 line:-2 align:center
so URLSession requires the download task
to have an HTTP GET request.


112
00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.469 line:-2 align:center
Other schemes or methods
are not supported.


113
00:07:15.502 --> 00:07:19.039 line:-2 align:center
Next, the server must support
byte-range requests


114
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:23,744 line:-2
and advertise this
using the Accept-Ranges header.


115
00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:27.748 line:-2 align:center
The server must provide an ETag,
or Last-Modified field,


116
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:32,686 line:-2
for the resource in the response,
but ETag is preferred.


117
00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:37.724 line:-2 align:center
And lastly, the temporary download file
must not have been deleted by the system


118
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:40,194 line:-1
in response to disk space pressure.


119
00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:43.730 line:-1 align:center
With these requirements in place,


120
00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:46.633 line:-2 align:center
you can manually pause
and resume a download,


121
00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:50.204 line:-2 align:center
or even recover
from connection interruption.


122
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,239 line:-1
Without a resumption protocol,


123
00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:56.210 line:-2 align:center
even a small interruption
forces you to restart your transfer


124
00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:58.779 line:-1 align:center
from the very beginning.


125
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,182 line:-2
This is an even bigger problem
for uploads.


126
00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:05.853 line:-2 align:center
Upload speeds are often much slower
than download speeds,


127
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:09,723 line:-2
so restarting means even more lost time
and resources.


128
00:08:09.756 --> 00:08:14.461 line:-2 align:center
iOS 17 introduces brand new support
for resumable upload tasks.


129
00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.496 line:-1 align:center
I'm super excited for these.


130
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.100 line:-2 align:center
Now, upload tasks
are automatically resumable


131
00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:23.504 line:-2 align:center
if the server supports
the latest protocol draft.


132
00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:26.073 line:-1 align:center
Let's explore the new API first,


133
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:30,110 line:-2
then dive-in to the details
of the resumable upload protocol.


134
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,812 line:-1
Just like download tasks,


135
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:36.850 line:-2 align:center
simply create an upload task
and start it by calling resume.


136
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,553 line:-2
To pause,
upload tasks now support


137
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:45,192 line:-2
the same cancelByProducingResumeData
method as download tasks.


138
00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:48.328 line:-2 align:center
The task automatically detects
if the server supports


139
00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:51.732 line:-1 align:center
the latest resumable upload protocol.


140
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,534 line:-1
If the server does support it,


141
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,703 line:-2
then you can store the resume data
for later use.


142
00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.974 line:-1 align:center
And finally, to resume your paused upload,


143
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:05,345 line:-2
use the new
uploadTask withResumeData method.


144
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:10,684 line:-2
You'll notice the pattern shown here
is identical to download tasks.


145
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.921 line:-2 align:center
That means if you've already
created a great experience


146
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,790 line:-2
for pausing and resuming downloads
in your app,


147
00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:21.595 line:-2 align:center
you can easily implement resumable uploads
for your users, too.


148
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,064 line:-2
If there's just
a momentary network interruption,


149
00:09:24.097 --> 00:09:26.533 line:-1 align:center
but the server is still reachable,


150
00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:30.604 line:-2 align:center
URLSession will automatically try
to resume your upload.


151
00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:33.073 line:-1 align:center
No extra code is needed.


152
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,976 line:-2
But in case of other,
broader connection issues,


153
00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:39.213 line:-2 align:center
like if your network or server
goes down entirely,


154
00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:41.615 line:-1 align:center
you can check the error for resume data,


155
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,518 line:-1
just like download tasks.


156
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:48.589 line:-2 align:center
I'm extremely happy to see
resumable uploads in URLSession,


157
00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:50.924 line:-1 align:center
and I hope you love them, too.


158
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,727 line:-2
But in order for you to take advantage
of this feature,


159
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.731 line:-2 align:center
your server must also support
the latest resumable upload protocol.


160
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:01,535 line:-2
This protocol
is currently being developed,


161
00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:07.007 line:-2 align:center
and there are efforts across the industry
to standardize it in the IETF.


162
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,679 line:-2
In the protocol, the client is able
to automatically discover server support.


163
00:10:12.713 --> 00:10:16.884 line:-2 align:center
This means URLSession can attempt
to make ALL uploads resumable


164
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,887 line:-1
on the very first request.


165
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.990 line:-2 align:center
If the server does not support
resumable uploads,


166
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:27,027 line:-2
the request simply continues
as a regular upload.


167
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.263 line:-1 align:center
Let's see how it works on the wire.


168
00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:34.835 line:-2 align:center
The client first sends a request
to an upload endpoint.


169
00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:38.205 line:-2 align:center
The Upload-Incomplete field
indicates that this client


170
00:10:38.238 --> 00:10:40.807 line:-1 align:center
supports resumable uploads.


171
00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:45.412 line:-2 align:center
The question mark zero is what's known
as a structured field boolean,


172
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,682 line:-1
and it represents the value false.


173
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:53,687 line:-2
This means that all of the upload data
is included in the body of this request.


174
00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:57.758 line:-1 align:center
If the server supports resumable uploads,


175
00:10:57.791 --> 00:11:01.495 line:-2 align:center
it detects the client's header
and advertises its own support


176
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:05,465 line:-1
using a 104 informational response.


177
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:11,104 line:-2
The 104 response contains
a location field with a resume URL.


178
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:15,342 line:-2
This resume URL is used
to uniquely identify the upload,


179
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:20,881 line:-2
so the client knows where to resume the
upload if the connection is interrupted.


180
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:26,286 line:-2
The server associates the upload data
it receives with this unique resume URL.


181
00:11:28.055 --> 00:11:31.592 line:-2 align:center
If the upload finishes
without interruption, then great.


182
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,796 line:-1
The server sends a 201 and it's done.


183
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:38.899 line:-1 align:center
However, if the upload is interrupted,


184
00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:42.836 line:-2 align:center
the client and server perform
the resumable upload procedures.


185
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:48,342 line:-2
The server has stored the partial upload
for the resume URL,


186
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:53,580 line:-2
but the client needs a way to determine
how much data the server actually got.


187
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:57,985 line:-2
To do this, the client sends
a HEAD request to the resume URL,


188
00:11:58.018 --> 00:12:01.588 line:-1 align:center
asking the server for the upload offset.


189
00:12:01.622 --> 00:12:05.559 line:-2 align:center
This offset is the true number of bytes
the server has received.


190
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:12,065 line:-2
The server then responds with the upload
offset for the client's specific upload.


191
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,303 line:0
And lastly,
the client needs to acknowledge


192
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,707 align:center
the server's offset
and send the remaining data.


193
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,777 align:center
To do this,
the client sends a PATCH request


194
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,215 line:0
to the resume URL
with a matching upload offset.


195
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,385 line:0
The body of this request
contains the upload data


196
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,687 line:0
starting from the given offset.


197
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:40,027 line:0
With that, the client has finally sent
all the data to the server,


198
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,995 align:center
completing the upload.


199
00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:46.900 line:-2 align:center
Your app gets all this for free
using upload tasks in URLSession.


200
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:50,304 line:-2
Now, let's take a quick trip
to the server side


201
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:55,309 line:-2
and explore how you can build your very
own resumable upload server with SwiftNIO.


202
00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:59.446 line:-2 align:center
For those of you already using SwiftNIO
on your server,


203
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,249 line:-1
this section is for you.


204
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,452 line:-2
Resumable uploads can be implemented
in any server,


205
00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:08.388 line:-1 align:center
but if your server already uses SwiftNIO,


206
00:13:08.422 --> 00:13:12.826 line:-2 align:center
there's a new package that makes it
really easy to add support.


207
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,929 line:-1
Let's go over a quick example.


208
00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:21.301 line:-2 align:center
If you're not familiar, SwiftNIO is an
asynchronous network application framework


209
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:24,004 line:-1
that works in your app and server.


210
00:13:24.037 --> 00:13:29.910 line:-2 align:center
In this sample code,
we're setting up an HTTP/2, server.


211
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,280 line:-1
We've added two handlers to our server.


212
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:37.084 line:-2 align:center
The codec translates HTTP/2 frames
into requests


213
00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:40.354 line:-1 align:center
our example handler can understand.


214
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:44,892 line:-2
In the other direction, it takes
responses from the example handler


215
00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:48.562 line:-1 align:center
and codes them into HTTP/2 frames.


216
00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:51.965 line:-2 align:center
The ExampleChannelHandler
performs the basic routing


217
00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:54.535 line:-1 align:center
and logic for our server.


218
00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:58.505 line:-1 align:center
At first, we only support regular uploads.


219
00:13:58.539 --> 00:14:04.044 line:-2 align:center
Let's find out how easy it is to transform
our server to support resumable uploads.


220
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:10,050 line:-2
First, we download
the NIOResumableUpload project,


221
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:14,621 line:-2
add it as a dependency,
and import it in our code.


222
00:14:14.655 --> 00:14:19.059 line:-2 align:center
Then, we define
a resumable upload context.


223
00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:22.062 line:-2 align:center
This tells the handler
which upload endpoint to use


224
00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:24.097 line:-1 align:center
when generating resume URLs.


225
00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:32.673 line:-2 align:center
And lastly, we wrap our current handler
in the HTTPResumableUploadHandler.


226
00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:38.445 line:-2 align:center
This performs the resumable upload
procedures on top of our current logic.


227
00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:43.050 line:-2 align:center
For each upload, it generates a random
and secure resume URL


228
00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:46.920 line:-1 align:center
and associates this with the upload data.


229
00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:51.758 line:-2 align:center
If a connection is interrupted,
the handler holds on to any partial data


230
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:55,896 line:-2
and responds to all
the resumable upload procedures for us.


231
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,197 line:-1
Wow!


232
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:00.801 line:-2 align:center
With just a few lines of code,
we've supercharged our server


233
00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:03.604 line:-1 align:center
to support resumable uploads.


234
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:08,008 line:-2
For those of you using Swift on Server
already, try this out!


235
00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:09.910 line:-1 align:center
And for everybody regardless,


236
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,379 line:-2
be sure to check out
the open-source sample code


237
00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:13.947 line:-1 align:center
from the link in the description.


238
00:15:13.981 --> 00:15:17.918 line:-1 align:center
The sample code also uses new HTTP types,


239
00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:20.921 line:-2 align:center
which allow you to use the same types
across your app


240
00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:23.824 line:-1 align:center
and your Swift on Server projects.


241
00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:26.927 line:-2 align:center
These data types were released
as an open-source package


242
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,162 line:-1
in collaboration with SwiftNIO,


243
00:15:29.196 --> 00:15:32.933 line:-2 align:center
so check out the Swift blog to learn more
and provide your feedback.


244
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,271 line:-2
You might have noticed
the resumable upload protocol


245
00:15:37.304 --> 00:15:42.843 line:-2 align:center
makes use of informational responses
using the 104 status code.


246
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:48,615 line:-2
The new HTTP Types make it easy to support
these responses on the server side.


247
00:15:48.649 --> 00:15:53.253 line:-2 align:center
In your app, URLSession handles
the 104 response automatically


248
00:15:53.287 --> 00:15:55.355 line:-1 align:center
for resumable uploads.


249
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:59.426 line:-2 align:center
But on top of that, URLSession now
provides a delegate method


250
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,296 line:-1
didReceiveInformationalResponse.


251
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:05.666 line:-2 align:center
This allows your app to handle
other intermediate responses


252
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,369 line:-1
such as 102 Processing or 103 Early Hints.


253
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:14,875 line:-2
Resumable protocols are a great way
to alleviate network interruptions


254
00:16:14.908 --> 00:16:17.311 line:-1 align:center
and save bandwidth.


255
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:22,983 line:-2
Background URLSession can also be useful
when handling large file transfers.


256
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:29,122 line:-2
Imagine your user wants to upload a huge
4K video from their latest ski trip.


257
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,191 line:-1
If their connection gets interrupted,


258
00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:35.128 line:-2 align:center
you want to make sure to resume
the upload if possible.


259
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,931 line:-2
You could do
all the error handling yourself.


260
00:16:37.965 --> 00:16:41.168 line:-2 align:center
Or, you can let background session
do it for you.


261
00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:46.907 line:-2 align:center
In fact, background session will handle
resumption automatically


262
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,677 line:-2
for both download and upload tasks,
if the server supports it.


263
00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:55.649 line:-2 align:center
If a task is interrupted,
the system will try to resume the task


264
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,718 line:-1
at increasing time intervals.


265
00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:01.522 line:-1 align:center
If the task cannot be resumed,


266
00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:05.425 line:-2 align:center
the system will automatically retry
the task from the beginning.


267
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,430 line:-2
Maybe your user loses cell coverage
on the ski mountain,


268
00:17:10.464 --> 00:17:13.500 line:-1 align:center
or a snowstorm took out their Wi-Fi.


269
00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:16.270 line:-2 align:center
Background session always waits
for connectivity,


270
00:17:16.303 --> 00:17:18.705 line:-1 align:center
so tasks will be scheduled at some point


271
00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:21.608 line:-2 align:center
after the device connects
to the internet again.


272
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,113 line:-1
While your user is uploading their video,


273
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,850 line:-2
they might leave your app
or put their device away.


274
00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.519 line:-2 align:center
Maybe they're getting ready
to shred more some powder,


275
00:17:32.553 --> 00:17:35.022 line:-2 align:center
and they still expect
their upload to continue.


276
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:40.060 line:-2 align:center
This specifically calls
for a background session.


277
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,596 line:-2
Background tasks are scheduled
by the system,


278
00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:46.033 line:-1 align:center
so they run outside your app's process.


279
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:50,103 line:-2
This means even if your app is suspended
or terminated by the system,


280
00:17:50.137 --> 00:17:53.607 line:-1 align:center
your network tasks continue reliably.


281
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,644 line:-2
Use a background session for large
file transfers that might take a long time


282
00:17:57,678 --> 00:18:00,280 line:-2
and need to persist
when a user leaves your app.


283
00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:06.420 line:-2 align:center
Lastly, your user deserves the best
experience when they're in your app,


284
00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:11.925 line:-2 align:center
and that might mean scheduling less urgent
tasks to happen at a later time.


285
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,694 line:-1
By using a background session,


286
00:18:13.727 --> 00:18:17.130 line:-2 align:center
you have several ways
to efficiently schedule network activity


287
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,166 line:-1
and save resources for your user.


288
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.903 line:-2 align:center
For tasks that don't need
to happen immediately,


289
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:26,340 line:-2
consider setting the isDiscretionary
property to true


290
00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:29.309 line:-1 align:center
on your background configuration.


291
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:33,046 line:-2
This allows the system
to intelligently schedule your tasks,


292
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.917 line:-2 align:center
taking into account factors like
"Is the user on Wi-Fi",


293
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,785 line:-1
"is their device connected to power",


294
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,788 line:-1
and "is the network constrained"?


295
00:18:41.822 --> 00:18:45.492 line:-2 align:center
This can be a great option
when downloading assets for later use,


296
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:47,995 line:-2
or uploading a nightly backup,
or analytics.


297
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.000 line:-2 align:center
To prevent using too much bandwidth
on Low Data Mode,


298
00:18:53.033 --> 00:18:56.036 line:-2 align:center
consider setting
the allowsConstrainedNetworkAccess


299
00:18:56.069 --> 00:18:58.672 line:-1 align:center
property to false.


300
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,074 align:center
Check out the Advances
in Networking session


301
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:04,444 line:0
for more tips on supporting
Low Data Mode in your app.


302
00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:10.884 line:-2 align:center
You can also schedule the background task
itself to begin at a later time,


303
00:19:10.918 --> 00:19:15.656 line:-2 align:center
when a person is less likely
to be using system resources.


304
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:20,160 line:-2
Late at night is often a great time
for scheduling tasks like large backups.


305
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,364 line:-1
To further assist the system scheduling,


306
00:19:24.398 --> 00:19:27.701 line:-2 align:center
we can set the
countOfBytesClientExpectsToSend


307
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,504 line:-1
and Receive properties.


308
00:19:30.537 --> 00:19:32.706 line:-1 align:center
By utilizing these properties,


309
00:19:32.739 --> 00:19:36.009 line:-2 align:center
you're empowering the system
