James: Hello.
I'm James Magahern from UIKit,


4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,017 line:-2
and I'll be your guide through what's new
with text and text interactions.


5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,721 line:-2
Text plays a crucial role
in every application.


6
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,790 line:-2
It's the primary way
to consume information and communicate.


7
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,994 line:-1
Now we're giving you even more tools


8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,830 line:-2
to create a powerful
text experience in your app,


9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,800 line:-2
whether you're starting from scratch
or from high-level abstractions.


10
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:38,305 line:-2
I'll be going over a bunch of great
improvements to crafting text experiences


11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,707 line:-2
and how to take advantage of them
in your apps,


12
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,777 line:-2
including some changes
to system selection UI,


13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,681 line:-2
adding text item actions and menus
to UITextViews,


14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,083 line:-1
lists and bullets in TextKit 2,


15
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,419 line:-1
dictation UI on macOS,


16
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:56,156 line:-2
and some important updates
for internationalization.


17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,626 line:-2
We'll begin by talking
about some changes to selection UI.


18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,430 line:-2
New on all our platforms
is a completely redesigned text cursor.


19
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,568 line:0
We now display an inline,
interactive switcher


20
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,037 line:0
when changing input languages,


21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,941 line:0
more ergonomic selection handles
when doing range selection,


22
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,443 line:0
and we also have a completely new loupe


23
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,913 line:0
to make it easier to place the cursor
in large bodies of text.


24
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:24,151 line:-2
If your app is using UITextViews
or UITextFields,


25
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,387 line:-2
then you'll get
all this new UI automatically.


26
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,591 line:-2
Additionally, we made sure
that clients of UITextInteraction


27
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,760 line:-1
also get the new selection UI.


28
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:37,564 line:-2
However, if you have a highly customized
UI for displaying text,


29
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:41,368 line:-2
it can be challenging to keep up with
these changes in your own implementation,


30
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:46,507 line:-2
especially if you aren't able
to adopt UITextInteraction.


31
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,378 line:-2
That's why in iOS 17, we've added
UITextSelectionDisplayInteraction,


32
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,680 line:-1
which just provides the selection UI


33
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,683 line:-2
without the gestures included
with UITextInteraction.


34
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:01,822 line:-2
UITextSelectionDisplayInteraction is a new
type of UIInteraction


35
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,825 line:-1
that can be installed on any UIView.


36
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:09,763 line:-2
You must also provide an object
that implements the UITextInput protocol,


37
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,332 line:-2
which defines various methods
for the interaction


38
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:16,770 line:-1
to obtain selection state from your view.


39
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:21,141 line:0
UITextSelectionDisplayInteraction will
then do all the heavy lifting for you,


40
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:24,311 line:0
providing the cursor view
and cursor accessories,


41
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:28,248 line:0
as well as the range highlight
and selection handles.


42
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,317 line:-1
All of these views are replaceable too,


43
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,053 line:-2
so you can customize the behavior
if you need to.


44
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,490 line:-2
Here's a quick look at an example
of how to do this in code.


45
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,561 line:-2
First, create a selection display
interaction


46
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:46,600 line:-2
and provide it with your document object
that implements the UITextInput protocol.


47
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:50,337 line:-2
This can be the same as your view,
if applicable.


48
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,639 line:-1
Next, simply add the interaction


49
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,777 line:-2
to the view you want to display
the selection UI inside of.


50
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,682 line:-2
This can be a container view
or the view that renders your document.


51
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,985 line:-2
Whenever the selection state changes,
just make sure


52
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,888 line:-2
to call setNeedsSelectionUpdate
on the interaction,


53
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,958 line:-2
and the interaction will take care
of updating all the views


54
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,327 line:-1
to reflect your new selection state.


55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,763 line:-2
In addition
to UITextSelectionDisplayInteraction,


56
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,533 line:-2
we've also added a new API
for displaying a loupe.


57
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,602 line:-1
It can be used on any view,


58
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:27,441 line:-2
and UITextSelectionDisplayInteraction
or UITextInput isn't required to use it.


59
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,610 line:-2
It's recommended to use
a gesture recognizer,


60
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:34,982 line:-2
such as UIPanGestureRecognizer,
to drive the loupe's updates.


61
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,252 line:-2
Here's how to manage
a loupe session in code.


62
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,487 line:-1
When using a pan gesture recognizer,


63
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:44,758 line:-2
in the callback, grab the gesture's
location and selection widget,


64
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,895 line:-1
in this case, the cursor view.


65
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,030 line:-1
Next, if the gesture is beginning,


66
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,034 line:-2
create a new UITextLoupeSession
by calling begin(at:),


67
00:03:54,067 --> 00:04:00,841 line:-2
providing the loupe's starting location,
selection widget, and coordinate space.


68
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,776 line:0
Then when the gesture moves around,


69
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:08,849 line:0
call move(to:) on the existing
loupe session to update its location.


70
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,451 line:0
Lastly, when the gesture recognizer ends,


71
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:15,656 line:0
make sure to call invalidate
on the loupe session to dismiss it.


72
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,625 line:-1
Next I'd like to go over text item actions


73
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,563 line:-2
and how you can use them
to display menus inside of text views.


74
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:27,234 line:-2
Text item interactions in UITextView
are now much more customizable


75
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,137 line:-1
using new APIs on UITextViewDelegate.


76
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:35,909 line:-2
These new additions make it possible to
modify the primary action for text items


77
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:41,348 line:-2
or present a menu like the candidate menu
shown here in the Translate app.


78
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:46,119 line:-2
Previously, UITextView allows developers
to disable item interactions


79
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:50,390 line:-2
through the shouldInteractWith APIs
on UITextViewDelegate


80
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,093 line:-1
for links and attachments.


81
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,297 line:-2
In iOS 17, you now have the ability
to customize item interactions


82
00:04:57,331 --> 00:05:00,734 line:-1
for text items in text views.


83
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:05,906 line:0
UITextViewDelegate has gained new methods
to customize both the primary action,


84
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,710 line:0
or provide a menu for specific text items.


85
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:13,213 line:-2
Here's a quick review
of what text items actually are


86
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,082 line:-1
and how they integrate with your app.


87
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:21,188 line:0
Text items represent the content
that support item interactions.


88
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:27,327 line:0
This includes text attachments,
represented by NSTextAttachment,


89
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:32,366 line:0
and links,
represented by NSLinkAttributeName.


90
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:38,105 line:0
UITextItem now also supports tagging
custom ranges of text for interaction.


91
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,140 line:0
To tag a range for interaction,


92
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:44,378 line:0
use the UITextItemTagAttributeName
on the attributed string


93
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,881 line:0
representing the range of text
you wish to make interactive.


94
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,918 line:0
With these new APIs,
it is now possible to change


95
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:56,056 line:0
the default tap or menu behavior
when a text item is interacted with.


96
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,092 line:0
For instance, you might want
to redirect known links


97
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:02,429 line:0
to existing views within the app


98
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:07,568 line:0
or add custom menus to parts of the text.


99
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:11,839 line:-2
To continue to suppress or disable
the primary action or menu,


100
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,842 line:-2
simply return nil
for the menuConfiguration


101
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,344 line:-1
or primaryAction delegate methods.


102
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,515 line:-2
Here's a small code example
demonstrating how to show a menu


103
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:27,120 line:-2
in response to the user tapping on a link
inside of your UITextView.


104
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:31,124 line:-2
Just implement the
menuConfigurationFor:defaultMenu: method


105
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,193 line:-1
from UITextViewDelegate


106
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:38,799 line:-2
and return a menu configuration
containing the menu you wish to display.


107
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,035 line:-2
You may also provide a preview
as part of the menu configuration


108
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,272 line:-2
to show inline
with the rest of the context menu.


109
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,177 line:-2
List and bullet support have also been
added to TextKit 2.


110
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,480 line:-2
I'll go over how you can take advantage
of this in your application.


111
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:57,518 line:-2
In addition to supporting multiple
different kinds of bulleted items,


112
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:02,723 line:-2
roman numeral, alphabetical,
and decimal ordering is also supported.


113
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,791 line:-1
Each one will automatically be localized


114
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,227 line:-2
based on the device
or app's configured locale,


115
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:11,999 line:-2
so worldwide internationalization
is built right in.


116
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:15,169 line:-2
Here's a quick example
of how you can get started with text lists


117
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,738 line:-1
using attributed strings.


118
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,941 line:-2
Use the textLists property
on NSParagraphStyle


119
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:25,179 line:-2
to define which paragraph
has an ordered list applied to it.


120
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,447 line:-2
The system will automatically
number the items


121
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,784 line:-2
based on line terminating characters
like newlines,


122
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:34,388 line:-2
and UITextView will automatically
propagate the paragraph style


123
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,790 line:-1
based on typing attributes.


124
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:41,395 line:-2
There are some big changes in the way
dictation works on macOS Sonoma.


125
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,497 line:-2
We have some new APIs
to help you make sure


126
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,934 line:-2
your custom text elements work well
with the new design.


127
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:52,172 line:-2
This is how the new dictation indicator
behaves on macOS 14.


128
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:56,743 line:-2
Like on iOS, dictation has a trailing
glow effect while speaking,


129
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:59,913 line:-2
and a microphone indicator appears
when at rest.


130
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:05,485 line:-2
Notice that after scrolling, the indicator
next to the cursor will stick


131
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,055 line:-2
to the edge of the scroll view,
and offer a button


132
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:12,359 line:-2
to return to the current position
in the document.


133
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:16,496 line:-2
If you're using a standard text control
in AppKit like NSTextView,


134
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,666 line:-2
you'll get this behavior
right out of the box.


135
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,302 line:-2
If your app offers
a customized implementation


136
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,239 line:-2
for showing the insertion point,
there's a little bit of work


137
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,407 line:-2
you'll need to do
to support this new behavior.


138
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:32,012 line:-2
Similar to
UITextSelectionDisplayInteraction for iOS,


139
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,314 line:-1
there's now a new API for macOS


140
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:38,752 line:-2
that also allows you to remain consistent
with the system's selection UI.


141
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:43,824 line:-2
Instead of drawing your own cursor,
adopt NSTextInsertionIndicator,


142
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,394 line:-2
which is a customizable NSView subclass
that you can place


143
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:51,899 line:-2
inside of your document's view
to indicate the cursor position.


144
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,867 line:-1
Its appearance is customizable.


145
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,136 line:-1
You can change the color and size.


146
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,407 line:-2
By default, it will follow
the current accent color.


147
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,210 line:-2
It makes supporting the dictation effects
really easy.


148
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,679 line:-2
There's just a little bit
of configuration required


149
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,516 line:-2
to allow the system to insert
the appropriate views into your hierarchy.


150
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:15,022 line:-2
Here's how to get started
using NSTextInsertionIndicator on macOS.


151
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:19,860 line:-2
Simply create an NSTextInsertionIndicator
view and add it as a subview


152
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:24,331 line:-2
to whatever view is displaying
the contents of your document.


153
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,868 line:-2
Once you've done that,
set effectsViewInserter to a block


154
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:32,372 line:-2
that inserts views provided by your system
into your document's view hierarchy.


155
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:36,143 line:-2
The system will automatically take care
of positioning the effect views


156
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:41,481 line:-2
and making sure they get updated
as the insertion indicator moves around.


157
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:44,451 line:-2
When your custom text view resigns
responder status,


158
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:48,288 line:-2
make sure to hide the cursor
by setting displayMode to hidden.


159
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,461 line:-2
As text is inserted, updates to the frame
will automatically be animated


160
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:59,499 line:-2
with a glow effect if dictation is used
as the input source.


161
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,535 line:0
If you need to disable the glow effect,


162
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:07,641 line:0
remove the showEffectsView option
from automaticModeOptions.


163
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,710 line:0
When the user changes input modes,


164
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:13,380 line:0
an effect view is displayed
beneath the cursor in horizontal text


165
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:17,251 line:0
to show the language selection UI.


166
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,820 line:0
If you need to override
the placement of this UI,


167
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,856 line:0
you can specify
preferredTextAccessoryPlacement


168
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,360 line:0
in your implementation
of NSTextInputClient.


169
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,795 line:-2
The system checks
the value of this property


170
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,398 line:-2
to determine
where to draw the accessories.


171
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:35,202 line:-2
When the text cursor is scrolled offscreen
during dictation,


172
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,105 line:-2
the system will also display
a scroll-away indicator


173
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,574 line:-2
to indicate the relative position
of the cursor


174
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:44,711 line:-2
and offer an affordance
to get back to the dictation point.


175
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,950 line:-2
To make sure this behavior is supported
in your custom text view,


176
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,653 line:-1
make sure to adopt NSTextInputClient


177
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:58,358 line:-2
and implement the selectionRect
and documentVisibleRect properties.


178
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:01,295 line:-2
Notify the system
about scrolling beginning and ending


179
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:04,565 line:-2
by calling
textInputClientWillStartScrollingOrZooming


180
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:08,335 line:-1
and willEndScrollingOrZooming.


181
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:11,939 line:-2
Making sure your app works well
in every language is crucial


182
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:15,075 line:-2
to providing
an outstanding text experience.


183
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,945 line:-2
We've made some important changes
to standard text controls,


184
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:22,482 line:-2
enhancing their readability and ergonomics
across a broader range of languages.


185
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:26,186 line:-2
Supporting dynamic type in your apps
goes a long way


186
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,257 line:-2
towards improving the layout of your UI
in every language.


187
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,627 line:-2
Something important to consider
when laying out text elements in your app


188
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,631 line:-2
is the fact that many languages can have
variable line heights


189
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:42,336 line:-2
in addition to layout direction
and font styles.


190
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,372 line:-2
A common issue encountered
when dealing with variable line heights


191
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:49,443 line:-2
between languages is the problem
of clipped text.


192
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:54,081 line:-2
Not only does this look bad, but it can
also drastically impact readability


193
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:59,119 line:-2
and significantly hinder
the overall user experience of your app.


194
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,288 line:-1
These issues may be difficult to notice,


195
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,958 line:-2
especially if you aren't able
to test your app in every language.


196
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,794 line:-2
We've made some improvements
to standard text elements,


197
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,963 line:-1
like UITextField and UILabel,


198
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:13,534 line:-2
to address this problem automatically
in most cases.


199
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:17,771 line:-2
However, there are some best practices
that you should still make sure to follow


200
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:21,175 line:-2
to ensure the system can prevent
clipping of these elements.


201
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,877 line:0
To prevent these common clipping issues,


202
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:27,114 line:0
all our platforms will now automatically
adjust the line height


203
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,249 line:0
in UILabel or UITextField


204
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:33,187 line:0
to accommodate languages
with highly dynamic line heights.


205
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,124 line:0
This new behavior takes place
only in specific cases.


206
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:40,093 line:0
First, keep in mind
that line heights are now dependent


207
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,764 line:0
on the device's configured
preferred languages.


208
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:47,501 line:0
Second, this adjustment affects
the entire user interface,


209
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,370 line:0
increasing line heights
for all text elements,


210
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:54,208 line:0
even those that display scripts
with fixed line heights, like English,


211
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:57,811 line:0
which wouldn't normally require
the extra space.


212
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,447 line:-2
This is intentional
to ensure visual consistency


213
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,249 line:-1
across all text elements.


214
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,652 line:-2
Lastly, this automatic adjustment
only applies


215
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:08,522 line:-1
to text elements that use text styles.


216
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:12,659 line:-2
Custom fonts will continue
to use their fixed line heights.


217
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,761 line:-1
This behavior isn't entirely new,


218
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,364 line:-2
as it has been in effect
for several releases.


219
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:20,667 line:-1
However, in iOS 17 it's much more dynamic,


220
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:24,404 line:-2
and the exact adjustment depends
on both the text style and language used.


221
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:29,042 line:-2
To take advantage of this behavior,
adopt Text Styles


222
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:33,914 line:-2
by creating a UIFont explicitly with
the preferredFont(forTextStyle:) method


223
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:37,751 line:-2
and assign it to a text element,
like UILabel.


224
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:41,555 line:-2
Next, avoid setting clipsToBounds
on text elements.


225
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:45,626 line:-2
Ascenders and descenders for languages
like Thai and Hindi will often protrude


226
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,128 line:-1
beyond the line height bounds.


227
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,430 line:-2
This is generally acceptable
in most layouts,


228
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:53,767 line:-2
since there's usually extra space
around neighboring elements,


229
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,403 line:-2
but it does mean
that setting clipsToBounds will result


230
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,606 line:-1
in those text elements being clipped.


231
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,911 line:-2
UIKit has also been updated
to prevent unnecessary use of this setting


232
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,446 line:-2
where it was previously enabled
by default.


233
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,051 line:-2
Lastly, ensure that your UIs
are responsive to changes in height


234
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,353 line:-2
and that all other controls
remain aligned,


235
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:16,256 line:-1
as text elements can now grow vertically.


236
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,993 line:-2
We also made substantial enhancements
to line-breaking behavior


237
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:24,598 line:-2
for languages such as Chinese,
German, Japanese, and Korean.


238
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,500 line:-1
These improvements apply different rules


239
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,670 line:-2
based on what kind of text style
you're using in your UI


240
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,739 line:-1
and which language is being displayed.


241
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:36,243 line:-2
For instance, previously,
a word within Korean text


242
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,780 line:-1
might have been split between lines.


243
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:43,851 line:-2
Now UIKit prevents such splitting
for title text styles,


244
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,754 line:-2
ensuring a more seamless
reading experience.


245
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:50,023 line:-2
To benefit from this new behavior
in your app,


246
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,327 line:-1
similarly adopt Text Styles.


247
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,362 line:-1
So that's everything you need to know


248
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,466 line:-2
to create a powerful text experience
in your app on iOS 17.


249
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,504 line:-2
If you're using a custom text view
in your app,


250
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,939 line:-1
make sure to use the system selection UI


251
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:09,943 line:-2
to take advantage
of all the new features in the OS.


252
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,312 line:-2
Use text items
to create better interactions


253
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:15,649 line:-1
with links in your text views.


254
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,385 line:-2
Leverage the powerful new features
of TextKit 2


255
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,388 line:-2
to provide a more rich
text editing experience.


256
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,158 line:-2
And adopt Text Styles
in common text elements


257
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,928 line:-2
to ensure a great user experience
for everyone,


258
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:31,164 line:-2
regardless of what language
or preferred text size.


259
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:32,799 line:-1
That's all for now.


260
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,168 line:-1
