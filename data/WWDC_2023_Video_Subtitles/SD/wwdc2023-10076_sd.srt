Miquel Estany Rodriguez:
Hi, I'm Miquel Estany Rodriguez.


5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,815 line:-1
Lorena Pazmino:
And I'm Lorena Pazmino,


6
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,017 line:-1
and we're from
the Apple Design team.


7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,152 line:-1
Today, we're going to talk
about how to design


8
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,289 line:-1
spatial user interfaces.


9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,091 line:-1
To help you get started
on this platform,


10
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,660 line:-1
we've built a visual language
that maintains consistency


11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,363 line:-1
and familiarity
with our existing platforms,


12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,431 line:-1
while also evolving
certain elements to adapt


13
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.768 line:-1 position:50%
to immersive
and spatial experiences.


14
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,104 line:-1
Miquel: We'll start by talking
about the UI foundations


15
00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:38.538 line:-1 position:50%
and design principles
to consider


16
00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.674 line:-1 position:50%
when creating app icons
and interfaces


17
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:44,044 line:-1
that are legible and usable
in an environment.


18
00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.447 line:-1 position:50%
Then we'll go over key concepts
and best practices


19
00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:51.184 line:-1 position:50%
to create layouts that are both
ergonomic and easy to target.


20
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:54,721 line:-1
And finally, we'll conclude
by showing how this platform


21
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,858 line:-1
can bring your app
from a screen to spatial,


22
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,627 line:-1
walking you through
all our system components,


23
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,696 line:-1
most of which you are
already familiar with


24
00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:05.499 line:-1 position:50%
and some that are
completely new.


25
00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:09.603 line:-1 position:50%
Let's dive deep
into UI foundation.


26
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,071 line:-1
These are the core
design principles


27
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.273 line:-1 position:50%
we will cover on this section.


28
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,543 line:-1
Let's start talking
about app icons.


29
00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:19.079 line:-1 position:50%
We wanted to keep
home view familiar


30
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,048 line:-1
and we've gone one step further,


31
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,983 line:-1
making app icons
three-dimensional


32
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:25,752 line:-1
and realistic in your space.


33
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.255 line:-1 position:50%
When people look at them,
they expand.


34
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,290 line:-1
And the system enhance
this visual effect


35
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.826 line:-1 position:50%
by adding specular
highlights and shadows


36
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,395 line:-1
to reinforce the subtle depth
between layers.


37
00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:39.499 line:-1 position:50%
So how can you design
a great icon?


38
00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.602 line:-1 position:50%
First of all,
use multiple layers.


39
00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:46.039 line:-1 position:50%
Other platform use layers
to create a parallax effect.


40
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,142 line:-1
Here, just by using flat layers,


41
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:53,146 line:-1
the system can create
this truly 3D effect.


42
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:56,817 position:50%
All app icons can have
up to three layers,


43
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:00,988 line:0
a background layer and up to
two foreground layers on top.


44
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,622 position:50%
Each layer
is a square image,


45
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,526 position:50%
and their size is
1024 by 1024 pixels.


46
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:10,430 line:0
Both foreground layers should
have a transparent background.


47
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,301 position:50%
Design your background layer
as an edge to edge square image.


48
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,472 line:0
Then all layers will get
cropped by a circular mask.


49
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,841 position:50%
And finally, when layers
match together,


50
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,910 line:0
a glass layer is applied
automatically, adding depth,


51
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,080 line:0
specular highlights,
and shadows to them.


52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,082 line:0
Try to keep graphics centered.


53
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,484 line:0
If they are too close
to the edge,


54
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,854 position:50%
they could look
off-center when expanded.


55
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:37,858 position:50%
Avoid using large regions
of semitransparent pixels.


56
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,560 line:-1
Layers with reduced opacity
will blend with the shadow


57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,562 line:-1
cast behind it.


58
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,097 line:-1
And that's how
you can easily create


59
00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.932 line:-1 position:50%
three-dimensional app icons.


60
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,635 line:-1
Next,
let's talk about materials.


61
00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.904 line:-1 position:50%
When people tap your app icon,
apps will launch


62
00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.373 line:-1 position:50%
in many different places
like this one,


63
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,876 line:-1
a broad daylight room,
or in a small space


64
00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:58.612 line:-1 position:50%
like an airplane,
or at nighttime.


65
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,280 line:-1
Apps need to adapt
to the lighting conditions


66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,516 line:-1
in your surroundings.


67
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,786 line:-1
They should be easy to place
in the space around you,


68
00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:09.823 line:-1 position:50%
easy to use at any distance,
and easy to view


69
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,359 line:-1
with any lighting conditions.


70
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,228 line:-1
And that's why we've designed
a new visual language,


71
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,697 line:-1
the glass material.


72
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,133 line:-1
This system-defined beautiful
glass window


73
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,135 line:-1
feels part of
your physical world.


74
00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:24.104 line:-1 position:50%
And its unique properties
allow light


75
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:28,208 line:-1
from people's surroundings and
virtual content to show through.


76
00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:31.011 line:-1 position:50%
In addition, specular
highlights and shadows


77
00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:34.915 line:-1 position:50%
reinforce its scale
and position in your space.


78
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,484 line:-1
And it works as a canvas
for your contained UI,


79
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,952 line:-1
making it feel lighter


80
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:43,023 line:-1
and adding a sense
of physicality to it.


81
00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:45.292 line:-1 position:50%
This lightweight material
also gives people a sense of


82
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:49,663 line:-1
what might be behind a window,
like other apps or people.


83
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,099 line:-1
To deliver great
spatial experiences,


84
00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.168 line:-1 position:50%
it's important to be aware
of your surroundings.


85
00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:58.872 line:-1 position:50%
Avoid using solid colors
on windows.


86
00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:01.274 line:-1 position:50%
Too many opaque windows
can feel constricting


87
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:05,145 line:-1
and make the interface
feel heavy.


88
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,614 line:-1
Glass responds
dynamically to lighting,


89
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,683 line:-1
adjusting the contrast
and color balance


90
00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:11.585 line:-1 position:50%
to feel part of your space,


91
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,688 line:-1
like in this transition
from day to night.


92
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,958 line:-1
Unlike iOS and macOS,
this platform does not have


93
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,494 line:-1
a distinct light
or dark appearance.


94
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,430 line:-1
Instead, glass and UI
naturally adapt


95
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,300 line:-1
when placed in front
of light and dark backgrounds.


96
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,103 line:-1
System-defined vibrant materials
take great advantage


97
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,506 line:-1
of this feature,
ensuring your app looks great


98
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,342 line:-1
across different scenarios
and lighting conditions,


99
00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:38.044 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a look at them.


100
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,914 line:-1
First, we start
with a glass window.


101
00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:43.083 line:-1 position:50%
If you want to separate
sections of your app,


102
00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:46.286 line:-1 position:50%
like a sidebar,
use a darker material.


103
00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.288 line:-1 position:50%
Or a lighter material
to bring attention


104
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.358 line:-1 position:50%
to interactive elements,
like buttons.


105
00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:53.960 line:-1 position:50%
Or you might even consider
using darker materials


106
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,263 line:-1
to increase contrast
for standard components,


107
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,632 line:-1
like input fields.


108
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:02,302 line:-1
Here is how Music app looks
with all the UI elements.


109
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:06.072 line:-1 position:50%
As you can see,
text defaults to white.


110
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:10,010 line:-1
So, imagine that you want to
design a lock-up like this one,


111
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.713 line:-1 position:50%
and you want to add
a lighter button.


112
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,750 line:-1
It is great to place it
on top of the glass material.


113
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.451 line:-1 position:50%
Or if you want
to get more contrast,


114
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,288 line:-1
use a darker cell behind it.


115
00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:24.324 line:-1 position:50%
Try to not stack lighter
materials on top of each other,


116
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:28.628 line:-1 position:50%
as it impacts legibility
and reduces contrast.


117
00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:30.564 line:-1 position:50%
Now, I'll show you
how typography


118
00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:33.233 line:-1 position:50%
has been precisely adapted
to this platform.


119
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,435 line:-1
To keep things familiar,
all font styles


120
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,572 line:-1
use semantic names that work
on all platforms.


121
00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:41.875 line:-1 position:50%
They have been tuned
on our point-based unit system,


122
00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:45.045 line:-1 position:50%
ensuring they are legible
at any distance.


123
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,980 line:0
To learn more,
check out the session


124
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,983 line:0
"Principles of spatial design."


125
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,118 position:50%
We've also modified
some of the font weights


126
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,653 position:50%
to improve legibility.


127
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,523 position:50%
Let's take a closer look.


128
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,626 line:-1
To improve the contrast of text
against vibrant materials,


129
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:03,396 line:-1
font weight has been modified
to be slightly heavier.


130
00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:06.099 line:-1 position:50%
For example, on iOS,
we use regular weight


131
00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.934 line:-1 position:50%
for the body text style.


132
00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.537 line:-1 position:50%
On this platform, we use medium.


133
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,906 line:-1
And for titles,
instead of semibold,


134
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:17,010 line:-1
we use bold,
keeping text clear all the time.


135
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,679 line:-1
Consequently, the tracking
has been slightly increased


136
00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:22.382 line:-1 position:50%
to help with legibility.


137
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,184 line:-1
In addition to
the well-known font styles


138
00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:25.785 line:-1 position:50%
we share across platforms,


139
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,121 line:-1
we've added two brand-new
font styles that take advantage


140
00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:31.825 line:-1 position:50%
of the wide, editorial-style
layouts you can use.


141
00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:36.496 line:-1 position:50%
Here is an example of the
Extra Large Title 1 on Arcade.


142
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,265 line:-1
Cool, right?


143
00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:42.068 line:-1 position:50%
Even though windows can scale up
to incredible large sizes,


144
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,970 line:-1
custom smaller
or lightweight fonts


145
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.640 line:-1 position:50%
can still be difficult to read.


146
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,709 line:-1
To improve that,
consider increasing the weight


147
00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:52.879 line:-1 position:50%
or using a typeface designed
for optimized legibility,


148
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,282 line:-1
like system fonts.


149
00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:57.717 line:-1 position:50%
Next, let's talk about
vibrancy.


150
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,386 line:-1
This is one
of the most important details


151
00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:02.522 line:-1 position:50%
to maintain legibility
across the system.


152
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,924 line:-1
Vibrancy brightens
foreground content


153
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,360 line:-1
that displays on top
of a material and works


154
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.097 line:-1 position:50%
by pulling light and color
forward from what's behind it.


155
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,832 line:-1
On this platform,
since the background


156
00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:16.403 line:-1 position:50%
can be constantly changing,
vibrancy updates in real time


157
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,306 line:-1
to make sure your text
is always legible.


158
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:23,510 line:-1
To show what I mean,
let's look at an example.


159
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.945 line:-1 position:50%
Vibrancy works on top
of the glass material,


160
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,581 line:-1
enhancing legibility
and making system materials


161
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:31.518 line:-1 position:50%
feel richer and sophisticated.


162
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:34,254 line:-1
Make sure to use the system
components when possible.


163
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:38,358 line:-1
By default, they take advantage
of this vibrancy effect.


164
00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:41.828 line:-1 position:50%
Let's pause for a second
and turn vibrancy off.


165
00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:44.698 line:-1 position:50%
As we just saw,
vibrancy improves legibility


166
00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:46.733 line:-1 position:50%
and how materials look.


167
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,203 line:-1
Let me turn it on and off
to show you the difference.


168
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:54,140 line:-1
Now let's see how
you can take advantage of it.


169
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.609 line:-1 position:50%
Use vibrancy
to indicate hierarchy for text,


170
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,645 line:-1
symbols, and fills.


171
00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:03.950 line:-1 position:50%
There are three modes: primary,
secondary, and tertiary.


172
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,586 line:-1
Use primary for standard text.


173
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:12,359 line:-1
Or use secondary for description
text, footnotes, and subtitles.


174
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,362 line:-1
You've seen the glass material
can be many different colors,


175
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,098 line:-1
since it shows the color
of what's behind it.


176
00:08:18.098 --> 00:08:21.000 line:-1 position:50%
Colorful elements on top
of the glass may be hard to see


177
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.204 line:-1 position:50%
if the color
of the glass is similar.


178
00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:27.440 line:-1 position:50%
Most of the time, consider using
white text or symbols


179
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,210 line:-1
so they are always
clearly visible.


180
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,179 line:-1
If you need to use color,
use it in a background layer


181
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.783 line:-1 position:50%
or an entire button
so people can see it.


182
00:08:36.783 --> 00:08:40.286 line:-1 position:50%
When possible, use system
color instead of custom color,


183
00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:42.355 line:-1 position:50%
as they have been
calibrated for legibility


184
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.858 line:-1 position:50%
and dynamically adapt
to maintain hue and contrast


185
00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:47.060 line:-1 position:50%
on the glass.


186
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.362 line:-1 position:50%
So those are the design
principles and the updates


187
00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.164 line:-1 position:50%
we've made
to the core components,


188
00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:53.933 line:-1 position:50%
like materials, typography,
and vibrancy,


189
00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:57.337 line:-1 position:50%
to make sure your app gets
elevated on this platform.


190
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,206 line:-1
Now I'm going to hand it off
to Lorena who will show you


191
00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:03.109 line:-1 position:50%
how to create ergonomic layouts
that are easy to target


192
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,613 line:-1
as you take your app
from screen to spatial.


193
00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:08.081 line:-1 position:50%
Lorena: Thanks, Miquel.


194
00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:10.750 line:-1 position:50%
Let's start by exploring
some of the best ways


195
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.953 line:-1 position:50%
to position content
so that it feels comfortable.


196
00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:16.289 line:-1 position:50%
Then show you
how to properly size content


197
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,991 line:-1
so that it's easy to target.


198
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,627 line:-1
And lastly, show you
how to create layouts that work


199
00:09:20.627 --> 00:09:25.298 line:-1 position:50%
with our new and beautiful
eye focus feedback.


200
00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:26.966 line:-1 position:50%
Because people
primarily interact


201
00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:29.002 line:-1 position:50%
with their eyes and hands
on this platform,


202
00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:30.770 line:-1 position:50%
it's important
to create experiences


203
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,407 line:-1
that prioritize people's
physical comfort and safety.


204
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,309 line:-1
More than ever,
you need to consider


205
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,178 line:-1
the ergonomics of your design,


206
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,880 line:-1
ensuring that the placement
of content is intentional


207
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,017 line:-1
and doesn't cause
eye or neck fatigue.


208
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,820 line:-1
For example, because of
the neck's range of motion,


209
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.855 line:-1 position:50%
it's easier for most people
to turn their head


210
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:53,326 line:-1
farther to the right and to the
left rather than up and down.


211
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,729 line:-1
So keep your UI in people's
field of view and be careful


212
00:09:56.729 --> 00:10:01.701 line:-1 position:50%
about placing anything
too high up or too far down.


213
00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:03.536 line:-1 position:50%
If you need a large canvas
for your app,


214
00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:07.040 line:-1 position:50%
go with a wider aspect ratio
than taller.


215
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,008 line:-1
For example, in Freeform,


216
00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:12.745 line:-1 position:50%
the canvas extends horizontally
and not vertically.


217
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,881 line:-1
Prioritize having
the most important information


218
00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:17.150 line:-1 position:50%
centered in your app
so people can comfortably


219
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.586 line:-1 position:50%
view your content.


220
00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:22.388 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we've covered best
practices for content placement,


221
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,724 line:-1
let's talk about content size.


222
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,660 line:-1
Each person is unique and
our eyes have slight variations


223
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.063 line:-1 position:50%
from one person to another,
which is why


224
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:33,266 line:-1
elements should use sizes
that are easy to target.


225
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,069 line:-1
Let's get into the details.


226
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:38,872 position:50%
Interactive elements
must have a tap target area


227
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,341 line:0
with at least
60 points of space,


228
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,677 line:0
so they can be easily selected.


229
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,248 position:50%
This means that your UI element
can be visually smaller,


230
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,317 line:0
like the standard button,
which is 44 points,


231
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,654 position:50%
as long as you add
enough space around it.


232
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,857 position:50%
So for this button,
it always needs


233
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,827 line:0
to have at least eight points
of empty space around it


234
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,328 position:50%
so it meets the minimum


235
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,499 position:50%
of having a target area
of 60 points.


236
00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.502 line:-1 position:50%
As an easy thing to remember,
if you need to have


237
00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.872 line:-1 position:50%
several buttons in a stack,
use standard system buttons


238
00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:16.709 line:-1 position:50%
with at least 16 points
of spacing in between them.


239
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,513 line:-1
Now, let's say you needed to use
a visually smaller element,


240
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,615 line:-1
like a disclosure control.


241
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,585 line:-1
You can use a mini button,
which is 28 points,


242
00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:28.154 line:-1 position:50%
in an area like
the section header.


243
00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:30.189 line:-1 position:50%
Even though this button
might look small,


244
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,592 line:-1
because it has 60 points
of space around it,


245
00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:35.562 line:-1 position:50%
it's easy to select.


246
00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:37.463 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at another example.


247
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,166 line:-1
Here, this button
still has enough space


248
00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:44.370 line:-1 position:50%
because the text next to it,
it's not interactive.


249
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,007 line:0
Similarly, using large
and extra large buttons


250
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,277 position:50%
requires less spacing
around them.


251
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:55,315 line:-1
So, always remember
to give all interactive elements


252
00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:58.651 line:-1 position:50%
at least 60 points of space.


253
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,653 line:-1
Now that we've talked about
how to size elements


254
00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:04.223 line:-1 position:50%
in your layouts,
let's talk about focus feedback.


255
00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:06.292 line:-1 position:50%
Focus feedback
is a powerful tool


256
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,963 line:-1
built into every interactive
element in this platform.


257
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,765 line:-1
When people look at
system-provided components,


258
00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:15.568 line:-1 position:50%
they automatically display
a subtle visual brightening


259
00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.270 line:-1 position:50%
or hover effect.


260
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.806 line:-1 position:50%
This hover effect
allows people to understand


261
00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:22.508 line:-1 position:50%
which parts of an interface
are interactive


262
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,244 line:-1
just by looking at them.


263
00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:28.181 line:-1 position:50%
When an item becomes inactive,
like the Share button,


264
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,551 line:-1
it no longer gives
focus feedback.


265
00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:33.987 line:-1 position:50%
This gives people confidence
that they are focused


266
00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:35.622 line:-1 position:50%
on the intended element,


267
00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:40.026 line:-1 position:50%
which means that they can tap
their fingers to select it.


268
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,628 line:-1
As you go creating layouts,


269
00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:44.897 line:-1 position:50%
it's important to take
the hover effect into account.


270
00:12:44.897 --> 00:12:47.834 line:-1 position:50%
For example, if you're creating
a list or a menu,


271
00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:49.669 line:-1 position:50%
you need to account for
a small amount of padding


272
00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:54.407 line:-1 position:50%
in between each item to avoid
having the hover effect overlap.


273
00:12:54.407 --> 00:12:57.210 line:-1 position:50%
Four points is recommended.


274
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,646 line:-1
As you're designing a lock-up,
include a shape


275
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,649 line:-1
that will allow the system
to display the hover effect


276
00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:05.118 line:-1 position:50%
as people focus on it.


277
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.721 line:-1 position:50%
Here, we have some images
with text below them.


278
00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:11.858 line:-1 position:50%
Each lock-up is a single
interactive element.


279
00:13:11.858 --> 00:13:13.526 line:-1 position:50%
You need to define
a custom region


280
00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:16.229 line:-1 position:50%
so it can brighten
as people look at it.


281
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,331 line:-1
This helps them understand
the entire area


282
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:21,300 line:-1
is a single element
that can be selected.


283
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,802 line:-1
And remember to keep
that small space


284
00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:25.938 line:-1 position:50%
in between each
containing shape.


285
00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:28.975 line:-1 position:50%
Another thing to keep in mind
is to ensure nested elements


286
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,778 line:-1
have relative corner radii
and padding


287
00:13:31.778 --> 00:13:34.981 line:-1 position:50%
that keeps them concentric
with each other.


288
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,650 line:-1
To help you figure out
how to size your corners,


289
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.253 line:-1 position:50%
you can use this simple formula.


290
00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:42.388 line:-1 position:50%
Corner radius
of the nested element,


291
00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:46.092 line:-1 position:50%
plus the padding in between it
and the outer container,


292
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,461 line:-1
gets you
the outer corner radius.


293
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,631 line:-1
And remember, in order
to keep your corners smooth,


294
00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:56.035 line:-1 position:50%
be sure to set them
to be continuous corners.


295
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,838 line:-1
Throughout the system,
every element is concentric


296
00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:01.074 line:-1 position:50%
to one another,
starting from the relationship


297
00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:04.143 line:-1 position:50%
of the window to the elements
in the corners.


298
00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.179 line:-1 position:50%
So remember to keep
nested elements


299
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,513 line:-1
concentric with each other,


300
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,350 line:-1
as this will help them feel
like they belong together.


301
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,120 line:-1
Now that we've covered best
practices to create layouts,


302
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,822 line:-1
let's take a closer look
at the components


303
00:14:15.822 --> 00:14:17.356 line:-1 position:50%
that you'll be using.


304
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,691 line:-1
In this section,
we'll show you


305
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,160 line:-1
how to take your knowledge
from existing platforms


306
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.030 line:-1 position:50%
and apply it
to spatial computing.


307
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.566 line:-1 position:50%
We'll start with a brief
overview of our input model,


308
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,701 line:-1
then dive deep into how
to set up the core structure


309
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:32.905 line:-1 position:50%
of an app with a window,
tab bar, and sidebar.


310
00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:36.576 line:-1 position:50%
Then we'll talk about
a new way of presenting content.


311
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,512 line:-1
And last,
we'll explore modalities.


312
00:14:39.512 --> 00:14:42.915 line:-1 position:50%
Let's get started with inputs.


313
00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:45.518 line:-1 position:50%
As we've mentioned earlier,
people interact with a device


314
00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:49.055 line:-1 position:50%
with their eyes, hands,
and voice.


315
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,990 line:-1
They do this
by looking at elements


316
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:55.628 line:-1 position:50%
and tapping their fingers,
primarily from a distance.


317
00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:58.731 line:-1 position:50%
However, people can also select
an element directly


318
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.666 line:-1 position:50%
by touching it.


319
00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:03.269 line:-1 position:50%
Additionally, people can also
connect a keyboard


320
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:05.938 line:-1 position:50%
or a trackpad,
allowing them to interact


321
00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:10.076 line:-1 position:50%
with the system
with a wide array of inputs.


322
00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:16.048 line:-1 position:50%
Interacting with
the system feels magical,


323
00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:17.850 line:-1 position:50%
but it means elements
have to provide


324
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.521 line:-1 position:50%
the appropriate feedback
for each of those models.


325
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,389 line:-1
All of our system components
have been built


326
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:28.127 line:-1 position:50%
to support each input.
So, use system components.


327
00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:31.297 line:-1 position:50%
They help you create interfaces
quickly so you can spend time


328
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:35,067 line:-1
finding what makes your app
unique in this new medium.


329
00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:37.403 line:-1 position:50%
To learn more about inputs,
be sure to check out


330
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,540 line:-1
the session
"Design for spatial input."


331
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.543 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let's walk through
some examples.


332
00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:47.013 line:-1 position:50%
If you're familiar with iOS,
many of the components


333
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,849 line:-1
in this platform
will look familiar to you.


334
00:15:49.849 --> 00:15:54.020 line:-1 position:50%
Let's begin with a window,
tab bar, and sidebar.


335
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,857 line:-1
Let's start with the core
structure of an iOS app.


336
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,027 line:-1
You need a window,
which has an opaque material


337
00:16:01.027 --> 00:16:06.365 line:-1 position:50%
and provides the canvas
for all elements to sit on top.


338
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,535 line:-1
As Miquel said, the window
is made of the glass material


339
00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:11.804 line:-1 position:50%
with a window bar below
that allows people


340
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,874 line:-1
to move your app fluidly
in their space.


341
00:16:14.874 --> 00:16:17.777 line:-1 position:50%
Similarly, on top of it,
you'll have your content.


342
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,281 position:50%
On iPhone at the bottom
of the window,


343
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,817 position:50%
laid out horizontally,
you have a tab bar controller


344
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,954 line:0
for your main navigation,
giving people quick access


345
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,822 position:50%
to the top-level sections
of your app


346
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,692 position:50%
with just a single tap.


347
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:36,329 line:-1
Here, the tab bar is vertical,
floating in a fixed position


348
00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.397 line:-1 position:50%
on the left side of the window.


349
00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:41.334 line:-1 position:50%
Designed to be out of the way
and easy to access,


350
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,769 line:-1
it's there where you need it,
allowing people to see


351
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,172 line:-1
where they are in your app
without taking away


352
00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.274 line:-1 position:50%
from your main content.


353
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,843 line:-1
In general, you want
to keep those feeling light,


354
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:55,181 line:-1
so avoid having
more than six items.


355
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:59,151 line:-1
When people look at the tab bar,
they can quickly select an item.


356
00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:01.754 line:-1 position:50%
And if they look at it
for a little longer,


357
00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:07.026 line:-1 position:50%
It automatically expands,
showing labels for each section.


358
00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:11.397 line:-1 position:50%
When people look away,
it automatically closes again,


359
00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:15.902 line:-1 position:50%
allowing people to focus
on the content.


360
00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:17.904 line:-1 position:50%
If you need to provide
sub navigation,


361
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,172 line:-1
like with an album
in this example,


362
00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:23.109 line:-1 position:50%
sidebars live in the window
alongside the tab bar.


363
00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:27.546 line:-1 position:50%
This gives people a clear sense
of where they are in that tab.


364
00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:29.782 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we've covered
the core structure of an app,


365
00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:31.517 line:-1 position:50%
let's get into
a new presentation style


366
00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:34.353 line:-1 position:50%
we've added, ornaments.


367
00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:37.189 line:-1 position:50%
In the Photos app, we have
a floating accessory element


368
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:41,294 line:-1
at the top center to navigate
between years, months, and days.


369
00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:44.463 line:-1 position:50%
On this platform, since we're
not bounded by a screen,


370
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,600 line:-1
that accessory is placed
as an ornament at the bottom,


371
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,902 line:-1
slightly in front of the window.


372
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,638 line:-1
This gives people
additional persistent controls


373
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:57,476 line:-1
that are easy to access
using depth to create hierarchy.


374
00:17:57.476 --> 00:18:00.446 line:-1 position:50%
Ornaments are a great way
to present toolbars.


375
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,348 line:-1
They allow people
to perform quick actions


376
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,017 line:-1
related to the content
in a convenient location.


377
00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:08.587 line:-1 position:50%
And they add a bit of depth
to your app.


378
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,957 line:-1
Since ornaments are usually
a collection of buttons


379
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,025 line:-1
and sit on their own
glass container,


380
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:16,762 line:-1
this is a perfect place
to use borderless buttons.


381
00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:19.966 line:-1 position:50%
In this case, it's clear that
these are interactive elements,


382
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:24,570 line:-1
and they'll still get the hover
effect as people look at them.


383
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.974 line:-1 position:50%
Here's another great use of
an ornament in the Music app.


384
00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:30.309 line:-1 position:50%
The Now Playing controls are
presented as an ornament


385
00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:34.046 line:-1 position:50%
that persists no matter
where you are in the app.


386
00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:36.215 line:-1 position:50%
This allows people to search
for their next song


387
00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:39.318 line:-1 position:50%
while being able to control
their music.


388
00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:42.054 line:-1 position:50%
When ornaments sit at
the bottom edge of the window,


389
00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:45.725 line:-1 position:50%
place them so they overlap
the bottom edge by 20 points.


390
00:18:45.725 --> 00:18:48.060 line:-1 position:50%
This helps ornaments
to feel like they're integrated


391
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,664 line:-1
with the main window without
blocking too much content.


392
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:55,368 line:-1
And they look really nice,
pulling colors from the content


393
00:18:55.368 --> 00:18:57.970 line:-1 position:50%
through the glass as you scroll.


394
00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:05.011 line:-1 position:50%
Ornaments can appear
and disappear entirely.


395
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:06.946 line:-1 position:50%
However, it is only recommended


396
00:19:06.946 --> 00:19:09.648 line:-1 position:50%
while focusing on a single
piece of content.


397
00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:14.153 line:-1 position:50%
For example, looking at
a photo or watching a movie.


398
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.689 line:-1 position:50%
Like in this example,
with just a tap,


399
00:19:16.689 --> 00:19:19.291 line:-1 position:50%
we give people quick access
to important controls


400
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,261 line:-1
without distracting them
from the main experience.


401
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,797 line:-1
Additionally,
ornaments can expand,


402
00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:26.432 line:-1 position:50%
presenting additional content,


403
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,869 line:-1
or even have their own
navigation hierarchy.


404
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,171 line:-1
So find where ornaments
fit in your app.


405
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,240 line:-1
They are flexible
and give your app depth


406
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,109 line:-1
without occluding content.


407
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,544 line:-1
Now that we've
covered ornaments,


408
00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:42.281 line:-1 position:50%
let's get into menus,
popovers, and sheets.


409
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,283 line:-1
On iPad, menus align


410
00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.385 line:-1 position:50%
to the leading edge
of the invoking button,


411
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,522 line:-1
and the button dims
as the menu opens.


412
00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.690 line:-1 position:50%
Popovers point to
the invoking element


413
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,393 line:-1
and the navbar becomes inactive.


414
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,929 line:-1
On this platform,
menus and popovers


415
00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:58.964 line:-1 position:50%
can expand outside the window.


416
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,999 line:-1
They appear centered
by default,


417
00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:03.369 line:-1 position:50%
ensuring that
the content always appears


418
00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:06.172 line:-1 position:50%
right where the user is looking.


419
00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:08.307 line:-1 position:50%
One thing
to always keep in mind


420
00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:10.142 line:-1 position:50%
is to change the button
that invokes them


421
00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:12.144 line:-1 position:50%
to its selected state.


422
00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:14.580 line:-1 position:50%
On this platform,
we always use black labels


423
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.117 line:-1 position:50%
on a white background
to show buttons are selected.


424
00:20:18.117 --> 00:20:20.086 line:-1 position:50%
This helps people
have clear feedback


425
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,221 line:-1
of which button
invoked the popover


426
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:25.524 line:-1 position:50%
without the need of arrows.


427
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,359 line:-1
As a general rule
on this platform,


428
00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.261 line:-1 position:50%
avoid using buttons
with white backgrounds


429
00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:32.298 line:-1 position:50%
unless they are selected.


430
00:20:32.298 --> 00:20:34.834 line:-1 position:50%
Finally,
let's talk about sheets.


431
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,837 line:-1
On this system, sheets
are presented as modal views,


432
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,406 line:-1
and they appear
at the center of the app.


433
00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:43.609 line:-1 position:50%
Modals contain the same
Z position as the parent window.


434
00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:46.946 line:-1 position:50%
The parent window
pushes back and dims.


435
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,448 line:-1
This helps focus the experience
and prevents people


436
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,150 line:-1
from interacting
with the parent view


437
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,019 line:-1
until the sheet is dismissed.


438
00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:56.922 line:-1 position:50%
If you need to present
another sheet, a secondary modal


439
00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:59.225 line:-1 position:50%
can appear in front
with an additional layer


440
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:02,495 line:-1
of dimming
pushing everything back.


441
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:05,764 line:-1
So let's look at it again
from the side.


442
00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:08.634 line:-1 position:50%
Because we're stacking
all these elements in Z,


443
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:13,372 line:-1
consider using push navigation
for nested views.


444
00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:17.343 line:-1 position:50%
Here's a quick example
of push navigation in a modal.


445
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:21,280 line:-1
The secondary view will present
a back button instead of close.


446
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.516 line:-1 position:50%
Also, notice how
the close and back buttons


447
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:26,085 line:-1
are in the top-left corner.


448
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,988 line:-1
As a system pattern,
always place close buttons


449
00:21:28.988 --> 00:21:31.957 line:-1 position:50%
on the top-left corner.


450
00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.592 line:-1 position:50%
Miquel: Now that you understand
the fundamentals


451
00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:36.495 line:-1 position:50%
of building an app
and using system components,


452
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,631 line:-1
think about
what makes your app special


453
00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:41.367 line:-1 position:50%
and how to take advantage
of the space outside windows


454
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,869 line:-1
to create rich spatial moments.


455
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,671 line:-1
For example, in Photos,


456
00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:47.806 line:-1 position:50%
we kept the browsing
experience familiar


457
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,043 line:-1
and focused on creating new ways
to experience your images,


458
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,446 line:-1
like Spatial Captures,
which give you an immersive way


459
00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:56.549 line:-1 position:50%
to relive your moments
and experience content


460
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:59.451 line:-1 position:50%
in a unique and special way.


461
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,054 line:-1
We've covered how to design
and develop accessible,


462
00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:04.190 line:-1 position:50%
familiar, and intuitive apps,


463
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,259 line:-1
using materials that blend
