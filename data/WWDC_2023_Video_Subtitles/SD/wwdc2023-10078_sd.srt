Manda Paul:
Hi, my name is Manda.


5
00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.415 line:-1 position:50%
I'm on the Apple Vision
Science team

Herman Damveld: And I am Herman,
and I'm a research scientist

8
00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.755 line:-1 position:50%
Creating experiences
in three dimensions makes use


9
00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:25.659 line:-1 position:50%
of unique modalities such
as depth and full field of view.


10
00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.195 line:-1 position:50%
We will introduce you to how
a person may experience


11
00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.998 line:-1 position:50%
this new level of immersion
through visual cues


12
00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.567 line:-1 position:50%
and motion information
from 3D content,


13
00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.903 line:-1 position:50%
and where human limitations
may interfere


14
00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:39.973 line:-1 position:50%
with comfort of people
experiencing your apps.


15
00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.743 line:-1 position:50%
Manda: Our guidelines are
to help you create experiences


16
00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:46.413 line:-1 position:50%
that are comfortable
and enjoyable.


17
00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:49.483 line:-1 position:50%
We'll talk through
visual depth cues,


18
00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:51.685 line:-1 position:50%
content parameters,


19
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.620 line:-1 position:50%
eye effort,


20
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.056 line:-1 position:50%
motion of virtual objects,


21
00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.358 line:-1 position:50%
head-locked content,


22
00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.127 line:-1 position:50%
motion in windows,


23
00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:03.397 line:-1 position:50%
and oscillating motion.


24
00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.766 line:-1 position:50%
To begin, it's important
that your content


25
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.969 line:-1 position:50%
provides correct
visual depth cues to the viewer.


26
00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.339 line:-1 position:50%
This matters because
well-designed 3D content


27
00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:15.409 line:-1 position:50%
enables the brain
to perceive depth.


28
00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.412 line:-1 position:50%
First, a bit of science.


29
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.847 line:-1 position:50%
We have multiple sensory systems


30
00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.283 line:-1 position:50%
with which we experience
the real


31
00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:26.353 line:-1 position:50%
and virtual world.


32
00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:30.123 line:-1 position:50%
At the very high level,
the visual system is responsible


33
00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.226 line:-1 position:50%
for taking in light
from the content you create


34
00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:36.430 line:-1 position:50%
and interpreting it
into what is perceived.


35
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.199 line:-1 position:50%
That is to say,
your design decisions


36
00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:44.304 line:-1 position:50%
have a significant impact on
vision comfort for your viewers.


37
00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:48.508 line:-1 position:50%
Agreement between
the depth intended by you


38
00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.877 line:-1 position:50%
and the depth
perceived by the viewer


39
00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:54.781 line:-1 position:50%
is necessary for vision comfort.


40
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.150 line:-1 position:50%
As an image moves in depth,


41
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.653 line:-1 position:50%
the brain enlists
the eye muscles to converge


42
00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:03.924 line:-1 position:50%
the line of sight and fixate
the eyes at the image depth.


43
00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:09.162 line:-1 position:50%
This enables a single image
to be perceived.


44
00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.131 line:-1 position:50%
To converge the eyes correctly,


45
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.234 line:-1 position:50%
the brain needs correct
visual depth cues.


46
00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:18.038 line:-1 position:50%
Vision comfort might be affected
when depth cues are missing,


47
00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:20.907 line:-1 position:50%
conflicting, or misleading.


48
00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:23.276 line:-1 position:50%
The viewer might
experience discomforts


49
00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:26.480 line:-1 position:50%
such as double vision
or eye fatigue.


50
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.352 line:-1 position:50%
Let's see how we can use image
cues to maintain vision comfort.


51
00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.988 line:-1 position:50%
When working with scenes
that are very sparse,


52
00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:38.992 line:-1 position:50%
as in this image of a citrus,
many visual cues are missing


53
00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.728 line:-1 position:50%
that might have conveyed
depth information.


54
00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.798 line:-1 position:50%
The brain might be unable
to reconcile what depth


55
00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:50.404 line:-1 position:50%
to converge the eyes to,
hence causing discomfort.


56
00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:55.542 line:-1 position:50%
Seeing the color of the citrus
enables the familiar size cue.


57
00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:59.379 line:-1 position:50%
If the slice looks green, the
brain uses the prior knowledge


58
00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.582 line:-1 position:50%
of the size of a lime
to inform what depth


59
00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.651 line:-1 position:50%
this slice might be floating at


60
00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:09.456 line:-1 position:50%
and converges the eyes
at that correct depth.


61
00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:14.628 line:-1 position:50%
Using blur is another way
to convey depth information.


62
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,763 position:50%
Relative size can also be used


63
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,566 position:50%
to add depth cues
to a sparse image.


64
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,035 position:50%
The larger of the two slices
from the lime


65
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:26,239 position:50%
is perceived to be
closer to the viewer.


66
00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.642 line:-1 position:50%
Gentle motion can also
provide a reference


67
00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:32.179 line:-1 position:50%
for what depth the line of sight
should point to.


68
00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:34.815 line:-1 position:50%
My colleague Herman,
will elaborate on the nuances


69
00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:37.684 line:-1 position:50%
of using motion in your content.


70
00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:42.956 line:-1 position:50%
For now, let's add just a few
more cues to direct the eyes.


71
00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:46.560 line:-1 position:50%
An added background,
light and shadow, occlusion,


72
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.296 line:-1 position:50%
and texture density
are some more methods


73
00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:53.233 line:-1 position:50%
to add in the missing
visual depth cues.


74
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,069 position:50%
Conflicting cues
are also troublesome.


75
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,139 position:50%
As mentioned, the bottom slice
appears closer


76
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,974 position:50%
since it looks larger.


77
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,742 position:50%
We expect it to be in front


78
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,445 position:50%
and occlude
the smaller looking slice.


79
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:10,817 position:50%
However here, relative size cue
conflicts with occlusion cue,


80
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,920 position:50%
telling the brain the opposite
of what we expect.


81
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.722 line:-1 position:50%
The conflict between
the depth cues


82
00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:18.992 line:-1 position:50%
might lead to vision discomfort.


83
00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:23.163 line:-1 position:50%
Conflicting cues are not unique
to sparse scenes.


84
00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:24.931 line:-1 position:50%
The more conflict there is,


85
00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:29.369 line:-1 position:50%
the more challenging
for vision comfort.


86
00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:33.206 line:-1 position:50%
So, ensure all of the depth cues
from your content


87
00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:35.876 line:-1 position:50%
give the brain
correct information


88
00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:40.180 line:-1 position:50%
so to align the viewer's eyes
to the depth you intended.


89
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.983 line:-1 position:50%
One more thought about depth
is correcting the visual cues


90
00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:47.220 line:-1 position:50%
that are misleading,
such as repeating patterns.


91
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.190 line:-1 position:50%
Here, both eyes are pointed
to the same object


92
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.658 line:-1 position:50%
in the repeating pattern.


93
00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:53.426 line:-1 position:50%
That's great!


94
00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:57.330 line:-1 position:50%
However here, each eye
locks onto a different object


95
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.132 line:-1 position:50%
from the repeating pattern


96
00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.201 line:-1 position:50%
and when the brain tries
to combine the images


97
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:03.236 line:-1 position:50%
from each eye into one,


98
00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:05.205 line:-1 position:50%
it's perceived
at a different depth


99
00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:09.309 line:-1 position:50%
than the repeating pattern
is intended to be.


100
00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.646 line:-1 position:50%
To mitigate this conflict
and to avoid double vision,


101
00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:15.182 line:-1 position:50%
use smaller portions
of the pattern


102
00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:20.287 line:-1 position:50%
or break up the pattern
with another design.


103
00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:22.923 line:-1 position:50%
A final note about
depth perception.


104
00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:26.626 line:-1 position:50%
The 3D content, along with
your visual depth cues


105
00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:29.496 line:-1 position:50%
will automatically be rendered
on each display


106
00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:32.832 line:-1 position:50%
per eye appropriately
to enable someone to see


107
00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.834 line:-1 position:50%
the depth you intended.


108
00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:38.405 line:-1 position:50%
If you choose to manually
render stereo content


109
00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.840 line:-1 position:50%
for stereo video, for example,


110
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.744 line:-1 position:50%
it is extremely important to not
only have correct depth cues


111
00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:47.847 line:-1 position:50%
but also have correct
disparity for each eye


112
00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.717 line:-1 position:50%
so to avoid extremely
conflicting visual cues


113
00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:54.955 line:-1 position:50%
which could lead
to severe vision discomfort.


114
00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:55.956 line:-1 position:50%
All right!


115
00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:57.857 line:-1 position:50%
Let's move on
to content parameters


116
00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.794 line:-1 position:50%
such as size and contrast.


117
00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:04.097 line:-1 position:50%
Visually comfortable content
have parameters suited


118
00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:06.833 line:-1 position:50%
for each specific
visual experience.


119
00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:10.270 line:-1 position:50%
Choose parameters
that reduce visual effort.


120
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.206 line:-1 position:50%
Here are some scenarios.


121
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.610 line:-1 position:50%
Content requiring fixating
the eyes for an extended time,


122
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.447 line:-1 position:50%
such as for reading,
is most visually comfortable


123
00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:24.050 line:-1 position:50%
when placed farther
than arm's-length distance.


124
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.021 line:-1 position:50%
In addition, enable a person
to adjust content depth


125
00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:30.824 line:-1 position:50%
so they may choose a depth
that's most comfortable for them


126
00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:33.627 line:-1 position:50%
in the experience.


127
00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:36.263 line:-1 position:50%
Reserve content
closest to the viewer


128
00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:40.267 line:-1 position:50%
for experiences demanding
only momentary visual effort


129
00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:43.970 line:-1 position:50%
or for experiences
inviting direct interaction


130
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.274 line:-1 position:50%
which occurs when someone's hand
actually intersects an item


131
00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:50.410 line:-1 position:50%
in 3D space.


132
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.946 line:-1 position:50%
Otherwise,
you may use visual cues,


133
00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:57.183 line:-1 position:50%
such as transparency or blur,
to redirect eyes


134
00:06:57.183 --> 00:07:00.754 line:-1 position:50%
to a farther depth
to increase visual comfort.


135
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.727 line:-1 position:50%
Similar to depth,
content size and contrast


136
00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:09.963 line:-1 position:50%
should match the particular
visual experience


137
00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:14.467 line:-1 position:50%
you are designing
to allow for vision comfort.


138
00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:18.638 line:-1 position:50%
For example, utilize higher
contrast for reading text


139
00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:22.542 line:-1 position:50%
and lower contrast,
transparency, or blur


140
00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:26.913 line:-1 position:50%
to redirect visual attention
elsewhere.


141
00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:30.317 line:-1 position:50%
Choose text size
and window size and depth


142
00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:33.586 line:-1 position:50%
for extended reading
such that text is legible


143
00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:35.422 line:-1 position:50%
with comfortable eye scanning,


144
00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:39.592 line:-1 position:50%
without the need
to rotate the head or body.


145
00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:43.697 line:-1 position:50%
One more parameter to be mindful
of is content brightness.


146
00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:46.666 line:-1 position:50%
When a large portion
of the field of view is dark


147
00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:50.103 line:-1 position:50%
as in this image,
slow down the transition


148
00:07:50.103 --> 00:07:52.839 line:-1 position:50%
to a bright scene
to give time to the eye


149
00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:58.345 line:-1 position:50%
for brightness adaptation
and ensure vision comfort.


150
00:07:58.345 --> 00:08:01.281 line:-1 position:50%
One last thing to be mindful of
for vision comfort


151
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:04.150 line:-1 position:50%
is the effort required
from the eyes.


152
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.553 line:-1 position:50%
For a more comfortable
visual experience,


153
00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:09.522 line:-1 position:50%
minimize eye effort
demanded from your viewers.


154
00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:11.791 line:-1 position:50%
Here is how.


155
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,261 position:50%
When choosing content location,
keep in mind


156
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:19,132 position:50%
it's most comfortable for people
to turn their eyes downwards


157
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,334 position:50%
or left and right.


158
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,772 position:50%
So choose those positions
for your content when possible.


159
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:30,910 position:50%
Upward and diagonal eye rotation
requires most eye-muscle effort.


160
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,949 position:50%
Holding the eyes at those
positions can be fatiguing.


161
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:38.218 line:-1 position:50%
Content requiring
extended reading


162
00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:41.521 line:-1 position:50%
or elongated target fixations
should be placed


163
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.557 line:-1 position:50%
towards the center
and slightly below line of sight


164
00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:48.928 line:-1 position:50%
to provide a comfortable
visual experience.


165
00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:51.364 line:-1 position:50%
If extreme eye-rotation angles
are necessary


166
00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:55.168 line:-1 position:50%
for your experience,
design for brief interactions,


167
00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:58.204 line:-1 position:50%
or else move them
to the center of field of view


168
00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:02.142 line:-1 position:50%
to reduce eye-rotation effort.


169
00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:05.412 line:-1 position:50%
It is also important to consider
that a person might prefer


170
00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:08.081 line:-1 position:50%
to take a break
to rest their eyes.


171
00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:09.282 line:-1 position:50%
To enable this,


172
00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:12.685 line:-1 position:50%
design for natural break points
in your experience


173
00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:17.857 line:-1 position:50%
to allow for
the person's eyes to rest.


174
00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:19.659 line:-1 position:50%
That's it for vision comfort!


175
00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.795 line:-1 position:50%
Next, my colleague Herman
will walk you through


176
00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:24.364 line:-1 position:50%
how to design apps
for motion comfort.


177
00:09:24.364 --> 00:09:25.732 line:-1 position:50%
Herman: Thanks, Manda!


178
00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.233 line:-1 position:50%
Next, we are going
to have a look


179
00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.335 line:-1 position:50%
at how the motion information
from content


180
00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:32.772 line:-1 position:50%
in your immersive apps
can affect a person's experience


181
00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:36.309 line:-1 position:50%
and where human limitations
may interfere with comfort.


182
00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:41.014 line:-1 position:50%
Let's start with digging a
little further into the science.


183
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,717 position:50%
We, human beings,
use multiple sensory systems


184
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:48,555 position:50%
to experience the real
and virtual world.


185
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,691 position:50%
We already saw that
the visual system is responsible


186
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,595 position:50%
for taking in light and
interpreting what is perceived.


187
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,332 position:50%
Part of that perception
is your own motion.


188
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,202 position:50%
The vestibular system
in your inner ear


189
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:06,139 position:50%
also measures
your own movements.


190
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,675 position:50%
Normally, the visual motion
information


191
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,678 position:50%
and the motion that you perceive
with your vestibular system


192
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:15,148 position:50%
are always in agreement.


193
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,784 position:50%
But when the visual motion
information is missing


194
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,587 position:50%
or conflicting with
the vestibular information,


195
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,922 position:50%
you can experience
motion discomfort,


196
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,326 position:50%
such as dizziness
or an upset stomach.


197
00:10:26.326 --> 00:10:28.561 line:-1 position:50%
Well-designed content
enables the brain


198
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.930 line:-1 position:50%
to perceive the world
as stationary.


199
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.099 line:-1 position:50%
This provides
a sense of stability


200
00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:36.503 line:-1 position:50%
and is necessary
for motion comfort.


201
00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:38.972 line:-1 position:50%
Let's go over
some scenarios with motion


202
00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.774 line:-1 position:50%
and see how we can
maintain motion comfort.


203
00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:47.213 line:-1 position:50%
The first scenario deals
with motion of virtual objects.


204
00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:49.015 line:-1 position:50%
When one or more
virtual objects,


205
00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.783 line:-1 position:50%
like these blue
polyhedrons here,


206
00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:53.453 line:-1 position:50%
cover a large part
of the field of view


207
00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:56.389 line:-1 position:50%
and move,


208
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.892 line:-1 position:50%
the viewer's brain might
interpret the visual motion


209
00:10:58.892 --> 00:11:02.662 line:-1 position:50%
of the objects as if the viewer
themself is moving.


210
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.631 line:-1 position:50%
This upsets
the sense of stability


211
00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:07.901 line:-1 position:50%
and can cause motion discomfort.


212
00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:09.702 line:-1 position:50%
As a designer,
you can mitigate this


213
00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:12.639 line:-1 position:50%
by making objects
semitransparent when they move,


214
00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:15.308 line:-1 position:50%
so the passthrough content
is clearly visible


215
00:11:15.308 --> 00:11:18.811 line:-1 position:50%
during the motion.


216
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:23.683 line:-1 position:50%
Whenever possible,
avoid using head-locked content.


217
00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:28.154 line:-1 position:50%
That is content that is
anchored to the user's head.


218
00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:31.124 line:-1 position:50%
Head-locked content will be,
always, in the same position


219
00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:33.326 line:-1 position:50%
in the field of view.


220
00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:35.295 line:-1 position:50%
If head-locked views
are necessary,


221
00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:37.130 line:-1 position:50%
use a smaller window size


222
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.699 line:-1 position:50%
placed near the center
of the line of sight


223
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.569 line:-1 position:50%
and farther away
from the viewer.


224
00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:45.338 line:-1 position:50%
Whenever possible,
use world-locked views


225
00:11:45.338 --> 00:11:48.942 line:-1 position:50%
to prevent content
from feeling stuck.


226
00:11:48.942 --> 00:11:52.779 line:-1 position:50%
Another alternative is to use
a lazy-follow animation.


227
00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:58.351 line:-1 position:50%
This moves content slowly
towards a destination over time.


228
00:11:58.351 --> 00:12:01.187 line:-1 position:50%
You also want to be mindful
of the motion of the content


229
00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:05.224 line:-1 position:50%
that will be visible
in a virtual window.


230
00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:08.661 line:-1 position:50%
When the content in a window,
such as this virtual landscape,


231
00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:10.396 line:-1 position:50%
moves...


232
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.170 line:-1 position:50%
...the viewer's brain might
interpret the visual motion


233
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.372 line:-1 position:50%
as if the viewer themself
is moving.


234
00:12:22.175 --> 00:12:24.410 line:-1 position:50%
To provide optimal
motion comfort,


235
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.580 line:-1 position:50%
you want to be mindful
about camera motions.


236
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.950 line:-1 position:50%
For starters, keep the horizon
of the content in the window


237
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.854 line:-1 position:50%
aligned with the real horizon.


238
00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:37.991 line:-1 position:50%
The point where all the pixels
appear to be coming from


239
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:40.627 line:-1 position:50%
is called
the focus of expansion.


240
00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:42.095 line:-1 position:50%
That's where you're going,


241
00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:46.599 line:-1 position:50%
and people have a natural
tendency to look at that point.


242
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.801 line:-1 position:50%
You want to move the camera
in such a way


243
00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:50.970 line:-1 position:50%
that the motion
of the focus of expansion


244
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.506 line:-1 position:50%
is slow and predictable,


245
00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:55.608 line:-1 position:50%
and you want to keep
the focus of expansion


246
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.378 line:-1 position:50%
within the field of view.


247
00:12:58.378 --> 00:13:01.881 line:-1 position:50%
That means that you want
to avoid fast turns


248
00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:04.617 line:-1 position:50%
or pure rotational motion.


249
00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.386 line:-1 position:50%
The focus of expansion shifts


250
00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:09.455 line:-1 position:50%
out of the field of view
in those cases.


251
00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.524 line:-1 position:50%
As an alternative
to fast rotations,


252
00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:14.127 line:-1 position:50%
you can use instantaneous
directional changes


253
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.730 line:-1 position:50%
during a quick fade-out.


254
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.234 line:-1 position:50%
To optimize for motion comfort,
you also want to avoid


255
00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:24.037 line:-1 position:50%
that large objects shoot by
at close range,


256
00:13:24.037 --> 00:13:27.573 line:-1 position:50%
as seen here on the right.


257
00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:31.044 line:-1 position:50%
Best keep objects small
and at a larger distance,


258
00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:34.447 line:-1 position:50%
as on the left.


259
00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:36.749 line:-1 position:50%
And if possible,
use plain textures


260
00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:38.651 line:-1 position:50%
with low luminance contrast,


261
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:43.589 line:-1 position:50%
which makes the motion
less perceivable by your eyes.


262
00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:46.526 line:-1 position:50%
The last type of motion
scenario to be mindful of


263
00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:48.961 line:-1 position:50%
deals with sustained
oscillations of objects


264
00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.998 line:-1 position:50%
and animations.


265
00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.067 line:-1 position:50%
To ensure a comfortable
experience,


266
00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:56.536 line:-1 position:50%
try to avoid oscillations
in general,


267
00:13:56.536 --> 00:14:00.940 line:-1 position:50%
and in particular those
with frequencies around 0.2 Hz.


268
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:06.446 line:-1 position:50%
That is one oscillation
per 5 seconds.


269
00:14:06.446 --> 00:14:09.849 line:-1 position:50%
And if you really cannot avoid
showing oscillating motions,


270
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:13.186 line:-1 position:50%
try to keep the amplitude
of the motion low


271
00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:16.122 line:-1 position:50%
and make the content
semitransparent.


272
00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:19.058 line:-1 position:50%
This makes the motion much
less perceivable by your eyes,


273
00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:21.194 line:-1 position:50%
as seen on the left.


274
00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.428 line:-1 position:50%
And it's always a good idea


275
00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:24.964 line:-1 position:50%
to provide
an oscillation-free alternative


276
00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:29.702 line:-1 position:50%
through the Reduce Motion
accessibility setting.


277
00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:32.705 line:-1 position:50%
To wrap it up, here's a summary
of the things to keep in mind


278
00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:35.341 line:-1 position:50%
when designing
for motion comfort.


279
00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:38.077 line:-1 position:50%
Try to provide
a sense of stability,


280
00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:40.480 line:-1 position:50%
avoid head-locked content,


281
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.682 line:-1 position:50%
be gentle with camera motion,


282
00:14:42.682 --> 00:14:45.451 line:-1 position:50%
and avoid oscillations
if you can.


283
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,187 position:50%
To learn more about principles
of spatial design
