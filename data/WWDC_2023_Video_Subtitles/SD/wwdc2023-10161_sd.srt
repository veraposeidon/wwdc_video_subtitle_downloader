Nick: Hi, I'm Nick,
an engineer on the SwiftUI team.


4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:20,454 line:-2
Inspector is
an exciting new element in SwiftUI.


5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:25,926 line:-2
I'll go over what an inspector is
and how to use the API.


6
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:31,865 line:-2
After that, I'll review modifiers
for presentation customizations.


7
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:37,304 line:-2
Inspector is the name for views that show
further detail of selected content.


8
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:41,041 line:-2
You have probably interacted
with one before.


9
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:44,044 line:-2
Keynote uses an inspector
to show formatting details


10
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:48,715 line:-2
for a selection, in this case,
the shape formatter.


11
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:53,320 line:-2
Here the inspector presents
as a trailing sidebar.


12
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,789 line:-1
Another common use case for inspectors


13
00:00:55,856 --> 00:01:00,894 line:-2
is showing content
that supplements an app's main content.


14
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:04,298 line:-1
Shortcuts uses inspector for this purpose.


15
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:08,135 line:-2
The main interface is the shortcut
that the user is editing,


16
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:14,308 line:-2
and the inspector supplements that with
the library of available apps and actions.


17
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:18,712 line:-2
I will be using this sample app
to explore the inspector API.


18
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,449 line:-2
I've been getting to know the animals
in and around Apple Park.


19
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:26,620 line:-2
This app saves the animals I've met,
tracks their name,


20
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,590 line:-2
tracks their favorite fruits,
and there's this column


21
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:33,594 line:-2
that I'll get to later
labeled "Suspicion Level."


22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,564 line:-1
And now, meet, SwiftUI's inspector!


23
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:42,135 line:-2
The inspector shows a read-write view
of details about the selected animal.


24
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,639 line:-2
Here I'm adjusting
Fabrizio Fish's suspicion level


25
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,008 line:-1
up to "Extremely suspicious."


26
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,512 line:-1
Actually I'll keep him at fishy.


27
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:56,483 line:-2
Inspector is available to
SwiftUI Developers on macOS


28
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,788 line:-1
and iPadOS and iOS too!


29
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:06,026 line:-2
The inspector API includes
programmatic control over column width,


30
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:10,631 line:-2
allowing you to tune the width
of the trailing column.


31
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:14,268 line:-2
The API includes programmatic control
over presented state,


32
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,939 line:-2
allowing hiding and showing
of the inspector as needed.


33
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:23,177 line:-2
Inspector is a higher level abstraction
than just a trailing sidebar.


34
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:27,281 line:-2
In compact size classes,
it adapts to a resizable sheet


35
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:33,887 line:-2
and inspector will automatically overlay
in split screen on larger iPads.


36
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:39,993 line:-2
SwiftUI already has an existing set
of structural APIs.


37
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,030 line:-1
Inspector fits in alongside these APIs


38
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:49,369 line:-2
with characteristics of both
navigation components and presentations.


39
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:53,640 line:-2
Similar to NavigationSplitView
and NavigationStack,


40
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:58,812 line:-2
inspector is used to build
the scaffolding of your scene.


41
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,584 line:-2
Similar to Sheet, popover, alert,
and confirmation dialogs,


42
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,590 line:-2
inspector is a presentation,
dismissing and presenting as needed.


43
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,660 line:-2
It's time to learn
how to adopt the new inspector API.


44
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:17,664 line:-2
Earlier, I showed off the sample app
I made for this session.


45
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:22,069 line:-2
You may have noticed I was tracking
each animal's suspicion level.


46
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:26,206 line:-2
That's because I am trying to solve
a high-stakes mystery.


47
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:30,010 line:-2
Someone is eating
all the fruit at Apple Park!


48
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:34,982 line:-2
I added inspector to my app so that I,
Inspector Nick,


49
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,851 line:-1
can gather the details of each animal.


50
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:42,155 line:-2
I'll show you how easy it was
to adopt the inspector API,


51
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,426 line:-2
and maybe I can solve
this fruity mystery along the way.


52
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:50,397 line:-2
Quickly, to Xcode!
The game is a-fruit!


53
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:56,036 line:-2
The first step to adding inspector
is using the new modifier, inspector.


54
00:03:56,103 --> 00:04:00,541 line:-2
Like some other presentations,
this takes a Bool presented binding,


55
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:05,712 line:-2
and then the inspector's content
in the trailing view builder.


56
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:10,017 line:-2
For the inspector content,
I have a ready made AnimalInspectorForm.


57
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:15,222 line:-2
I have some custom methods for passing
in the animal currently being inspected.


58
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:19,927 line:-2
And there's my inspector, presenting
as a trailing column here on macOS.


59
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:24,631 line:-2
I have planted the seeds of
a wonderful inspector experience.


60
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:28,402 line:-2
This AnimalForm
is using the grouped style.


61
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:33,841 line:-2
In case you haven't encountered form
styles before, they're applied like this<i>.</i>


62
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:37,845 line:-2
But because inspector contexts
use the grouped style by default,


63
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:41,582 line:-1
I don't need to style it myself.


64
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:48,388 line:-2
I can even interact with the inspector
in the preview's canvas.


65
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,557 line:-1
Ah, this reminds me,


66
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:55,195 line:-2
while inspectors can collapse by default,
they aren't resizable by default.


67
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:59,166 line:-2
I can change that
using the inspector column width modifier.


68
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,268 line:-1
I'll use some sensible defaults.


69
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:07,608 line:-2
200 for min, 300 for ideal,
and 400 for max.


70
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,979 line:-2
This ideal parameter will be
the size of the column at at first launch,


71
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,681 line:-1
but if the user resizes the inspector,


72
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:18,919 line:-2
the system will persist
that size across launches.


73
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:25,993 line:-2
Lastly, I'll add a toolbar
item to toggle the presented state.


74
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,429 line:-2
I'll use a button
that toggles the presented property,


75
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:35,068 line:-2
and for its label, a Label,
using the info.circle system image.


76
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,671 line:-2
The toolbar item will appear
in the section of the toolbar


77
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:42,376 line:-2
above the inspector because it's declared
within the inspector's view builder.


78
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,647 line:-2
When I scroll, the toolbar
behaves exactly like I'd expect,


79
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:51,018 line:-2
showing a shadow pocket when enough
of the content is underneath the toolbar.


80
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:58,659 line:-2
I used the inspector modifier
on the AnimalTable intentionally,


81
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,662 line:-2
rather than some other spot
in the view hierarchy.


82
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,998 line:-2
Like many SwiftUI APIs,
the inspector modifier


83
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:10,771 line:-2
has different behaviors depending
on the context of where it is applied.


84
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,473 line:-2
Specifically,
the placement decides whether


85
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,510 line:-2
the full height style is used,
where there is no separation


86
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,780 line:-1
between toolbar and content,


87
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,949 line:-1
or the under toolbar style is used,


88
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:25,385 line:-2
where the inspector
is nested under the toolbar.


89
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,121 line:-2
Notice the title separator
spans the full width


90
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:32,326 line:-2
of the window
in the under toolbar appearance.


91
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:38,565 line:-2
Similarly, toolbar content will be placed
in the main content's toolbar...


92
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,268 line:-1
or in the inspector's toolbar,


93
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:44,538 line:-2
depending on where
the toolbar modifier is used.


94
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:48,542 line:-2
There are two points to consider
when using the inspector API.


95
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,645 line:-2
First, is the inspector
going to be placed inside


96
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:56,917 line:-2
or outside of a navigation structure like
a NavigationStack or NavigationSplitView?


97
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:00,587 line:-2
Second, should the toolbar content
be inside or outside


98
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,557 line:-1
of the inspector's view builder?


99
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,360 line:-2
I'll walk through two
of these constructions.


100
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,397 line:-2
First up, placing inspector
inside a navigation structure,


101
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:14,668 line:-2
with toolbar content
outside the inspector.


102
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,971 line:-2
When an inspector is contained
within a NavigationStack,


103
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:22,643 line:-2
the inspector is underneath
the navigation stack's toolbar.


104
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:26,346 line:-2
Here, the toolbar content is declared
outside of the inspector


105
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:31,285 line:-2
on the main content and is rendered
in the navigation stack's toolbar.


106
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:35,322 line:-2
In compact horizontal size classes,
the inspector presents as a sheet


107
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:41,295 line:-2
and the toolbar item stays
in the main<i> </i>content's toolbar.


108
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,364 line:-1
Back to my table of possibilities.


109
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,033 line:-1
For the second construction,


110
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,770 line:-2
I'll look at placing the inspector
outside of a navigation structure,


111
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:54,875 line:-2
with toolbar content
inside the inspector view builder.


112
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:59,379 line:-2
When the inspector modifier is placed
outside of a navigation structure,


113
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:04,051 line:-2
the inspector is given the full height
of the trailing column to lay out.


114
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,920 line:-1
If the inspector has toolbar content,


115
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,823 line:-2
that content will be placed
in a toolbar section


116
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,092 line:-1
specifically for the inspector.


117
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,529 line:-2
These two toolbar items are positioned
with the principal placement


118
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:20,868 line:-2
and end up centered in the navigation
toolbar above the inspector.


119
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,570 line:-2
This time, however,
because the toolbar content


120
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:26,306 line:-1
is inside the inspector's view builder,


121
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:32,012 line:-2
when the inspector presents as a sheet,
the toolbar content is in the sheet.


122
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,385 line:-1
These principles extend to macOS,


123
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:42,723 line:-2
except inspector does not present
as a sheet on macOS,


124
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,925 line:-1
and so the table becomes simpler.


125
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:50,664 line:-2
The only axis to worry about is inside
or outside a navigation structure.


126
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:54,301 line:-1
A final, but important note:


127
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:58,972 line:-2
If you are using an inspector
within a NavigationSplitView,


128
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,111 line:-2
the inspector should be placed
in the detail column's view builder,


129
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:05,913 line:-1
or, just like before,


130
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:10,884 line:-2
it can also be placed entirely
outside the navigation structure.


131
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:17,491 line:-2
Wow, all of this mystery solving
is making me hungry!


132
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,427 line:-1
[apple crunches]


133
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:23,830 line:-1
Oh!


134
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:28,502 line:-1
I'm getting a Nibble Bulletin in the app!


135
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,505 line:-2
The app shows Nibble Bulletins
as resizable sheets


136
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:37,845 line:-2
with some information about
where and when the fruit was nibbled.


137
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:42,216 line:-2
This is a great time for me to talk about
presentation customizations


138
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:46,987 line:-1
SwiftUI released with iOS 16.4.


139
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:52,526 line:-2
The fruit nibble bulletin is a sheet,
not an inspector.


140
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:56,063 line:-2
Presentation modifiers allow
deep customization of sheets


141
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,099 line:-1
and other presentations like popovers.


142
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,536 line:-1
I'll try a few of them out.


143
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:06,206 line:-2
The presentation background modifier
is aptly named.


144
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,878 line:-2
It will set the background
of a presentation.


145
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,380 line:-1
Unlike the existing background modifier,


146
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:17,451 line:-2
the presentation specific modifier
will fill the entire presentation


147
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:21,255 line:-2
and allow underlying content
to show through.


148
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,924 line:-1
So, if I use a thinMaterial,


149
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:29,196 line:-2
I'll see a hint of the List
behind the sheet.


150
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,199 line:-2
I'd like to allow interaction
with content behind the sheet,


151
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,067 line:-1
in case I want to scroll the list,


152
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,372 line:-2
and look at suspects
while reading the Nibble Bulletin.


153
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:43,777 line:-2
This is as simple as
presentationBackgroundInteraction enabled.


154
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,379 line:-1
The dimming view is removed


155
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:49,583 line:-2
and I can now interact
with the background content.


156
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,085 line:-2
The PresentationBackgroundInteraction
type


157
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:57,291 line:-2
can also have an upThrough parameter
accepting a presentation detent.


158
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:02,196 line:-2
As long as the provided argument matches
one of the given presentation's detents,


159
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,199 line:-2
SwiftUI will only provide
the dimming view at detents


160
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,969 line:-1
greater than the upThrough argument.


161
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:12,973 line:-2
I want dimming at any detent
above a height of 200,


162
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,178 line:-2
so I will first add a height detent of 200
using the presentationDetents modifier.


163
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,982 line:-2
I'll adjust the sheet
from its current detent of medium...


164
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,319 line:-1
down to my custom height of 200.


165
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:29,122 line:-2
When I only enable background interaction
up through 200,


166
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:35,829 line:-2
the dimming view will return
for the medium and large detents.


167
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,532 line:-2
There are more customizations
available to you


168
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:41,802 line:-2
to get the perfect look and feel
for presentations.


169
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,670 line:-1
Many of these modifiers have effects


170
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:48,275 line:-2
on other presentations too,
not just sheets.


171
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:51,578 line:-2
And one more thing
about presentation modifiers.


172
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,681 line:-2
Those same modifiers compose
with Inspector


173
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,117 line:-1
when Inspector is presenting as a sheet.


174
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,186 line:-1
For my inspector from earlier,


175
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:03,123 line:-2
to disable background content interaction
at the medium detent,


176
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,594 line:-2
I can use the same exact code
from before...


177
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,831 line:-1
declaring a height detent,


178
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:15,903 line:-2
and only enabling background interaction
up through the same detent.


179
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:20,974 line:-2
Now the inspector dims
at the medium detent and higher.


180
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,744 line:-1
And that's inspectors in SwiftUI.


181
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:29,583 line:-2
In this video, I introduced the inspector
API and the nuances of using it.


182
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,987 line:-2
I picked some of my favorite sheet
presentation modifiers to demonstrate,


183
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:37,357 line:-2
and showed how
they can compose with inspectors.


184
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,493 line:-1
So what are you waiting for?


185
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,196 line:-1
Go out and get inspecting.


186
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,098 line:-1
Place the inspector somewhere in your app.


187
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,936 line:-2
Keep it going
by customizing your presentations.


188
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,505 line:-1
And as for the nibbler,


189
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:55,909 line:-2
I guess our efforts to solve this mystery
were fruitless.
