Will: Hi, welcome to
"What's New in App Pre-orders?"


4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,552 line:-2
My name's Will Lo, and I'm a software
engineer on the App Store Connect team.


5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,555 line:-2
Offering your app for pre-order
can be a powerful way


6
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,992 line:-2
to generate excitement
for your upcoming app release.


7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,594 line:-2
When you make your app available
for pre-order,


8
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,764 line:-2
its product page becomes published
on the App Store,


9
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:34,668 line:-2
where your app can be purchased
before it's released for download.


10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,571 line:-2
On release day,
your customers will be notified


11
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:41,909 line:-2
and your app will be automatically
downloaded on their devices.


12
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,913 line:-2
In this session, I want to talk
about some exciting updates


13
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,948 line:-1
that we're making in App Store Connect.


14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,317 line:-1
This year, we're giving you the ability


15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,388 line:-2
to offer your app for pre-order
on a regional basis.


16
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,857 line:-2
These updates will give you
more flexibility


17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,395 line:-2
to choosing where and how you publish
your apps for pre-order.


18
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:05,599 line:-2
So for an unreleased app,
you'll be able to choose specific regions


19
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,735 line:-2
to publish for pre-order,
just as you can today.


20
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,939 line:0
But with this new flexibility,


21
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:15,242 line:0
you'll also be able to first release
your app to a few regions,


22
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,445 line:0
as a soft launch or limited release,


23
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,283 line:-2
and then offer your app for pre-order
in any other region you choose.


24
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:26,353 line:0
And as you continue expanding
the reach of your app,


25
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:31,892 line:0
you can use pre-order to further build
excitement in each additional region.


26
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:36,029 line:-2
So let's walk through a few examples
using App Store Connect


27
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,965 line:-1
to set up these pre-orders.


28
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,400 line:-1
In this first example,


29
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,770 line:-2
Backyard Birds is a brand new,
unreleased app


30
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,706 line:-1
that you want to publish as a pre-order


31
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,509 line:-2
to generate some excitement
around its release.


32
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:52,513 line:-2
Let's say that you want to release
Backyard Birds on September 1,


33
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:57,117 line:-2
and that you've got your product page
details all set up on App Store Connect.


34
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,086 line:-1
To set up your first pre-order,


35
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,622 line:-2
you can head
to the Pricing and Availability page


36
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:05,025 line:-1
and click Set Up Availability.


37
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,860 line:-1
Then, within this dialog,


38
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:11,965 line:-2
select<i> </i>Pre-Order
in Specific Countries or Regions.


39
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,535 line:-2
Here's where you would enter
your expected release date,


40
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:15,602 line:-1
September 1.


41
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:20,374 line:-2
The expected release date
can be up to 180 days in the future.


42
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,844 line:-2
Next, you would select
the United States,


43
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,981 line:-2
where your app will be made available
for pre-order.


44
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,884 line:-2
And finally,
you'll see this confirmation screen,


45
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,287 line:-1
showing you the expected release date


46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,790 line:-2
and where the app will be available
for pre-order.


47
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,127 line:-2
And with that, the app is now
properly set up for pre-order


48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,096 line:-2
in the United States
with an expected release date


49
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,464 line:-1
of September 1.


50
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,834 line:-2
That's when
your customers will be notified,


51
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:51,205 line:-2
and your app will be
automatically downloaded to their devices.


52
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,140 line:-1
Now, let's scroll down a bit


53
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,242 line:-2
and take a look
at the Availability section,


54
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:59,279 line:-2
which now gives you a complete
detailed view of the app's release status


55
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,348 line:-1
in each country or region.


56
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,984 line:-1
So whether the app is ready for sale,


57
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,954 line:-2
published for pre-order,
or otherwise unavailable,


58
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,756 line:-1
this page will help you understand that.


59
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,428 line:-2
In this example,
this app is available in multiple regions.


60
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,464 line:-1
But if your app is somehow unavailable,


61
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,900 line:-1
you'll see a status label like this one


62
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,103 line:-2
that tells you exactly
what's happening in each region.


63
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:28,542 line:-2
So that's how you would set up
publishing a brand new app for pre-order.


64
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,679 line:0
Now, let's re-imagine the scenario
for our example app.


65
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,016 line:0
Let's say that Backyard Birds
was a limited release,


66
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,385 line:0
published in just Canada.


67
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,521 line:0
The initial reaction
has been really great,


68
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,191 line:0
and you would like to expand
its availability to the United States,


69
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,895 line:0
with a scheduled release date
of March 1 of next year.


70
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:50,964 line:-2
Let's walk through how we can
set that up as a pre-order.


71
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,768 line:-2
First, from within
the Pricing and Availability page,


72
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:59,373 line:-2
you can hit<i> </i>Manage
under the App Availability section.


73
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:03,710 line:-2
Here, we can see
that it's currently available in Canada.


74
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,980 line:-2
So to publish your pre-order
in the United States,


75
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:10,017 line:-1
you can first hit Set Up Pre-order.


76
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,789 line:-2
Then, you'll enter your expected
release date, March 1st, 2024.


77
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,026 line:-2
For an app that's already published
on the App Store,


78
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:24,998 line:-2
the expected release date
can be up to 365 days in the future.


79
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:30,904 line:-2
Next, select the United States
to publish your pre-order in.


80
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,774 line:-2
Finally,
you'll see this confirmation screen,


81
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,310 line:-1
showing you a summary of your changes.


82
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:41,148 line:-2
These changes will appear
on the App Store within 24 hours.


83
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:45,252 line:-2
Here, you can see your app's
updated pre-order availability.


84
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,755 line:-2
The Published column shows you
that your pre-order has been published


85
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,490 line:-1
in the United States today,


86
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,659 line:-1
while the Scheduled Release Date column


87
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:57,497 line:-2
shows you that the app is currently
scheduled to be released on March 1.


88
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,334 line:-2
Now,
from within the App Availability page,


89
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,403 line:-2
you can update the pre-orders
that you've already set up as well.


90
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,273 line:-1
We'll walk through a final example


91
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,575 line:-2
and update the pre-order
that was published.


92
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:11,678 line:-2
If you hit Edit,
you'll first be presented with a dialog


93
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,915 line:-2
that lets you update
three different settings.


94
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,718 line:-2
First,
you can update your app's release date.


95
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,888 line:-2
Since this example app
was already released in Canada,


96
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,290 line:-1
you can choose any date in the future,


97
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,427 line:-2
up to 365 days
from when your US pre-order


98
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,096 line:-1
was originally published.


99
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,901 line:-2
Next, you can also release
your pre-order immediately.


100
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,669 line:-1
Your customers will be notified


101
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,605 line:-2
and your app will be downloaded
to their devices.


102
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,607 line:-1
Remember, once you release your app,


103
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,243 line:-2
it can't be made available
for pre-order again


104
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,879 line:-1
in the regions that you've published in.


105
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:48,949 line:-2
Finally,
you can choose to remove your pre-order


106
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,252 line:-1
from the App Store in that region.


107
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:56,023 line:-2
After publishing your app
for pre-order on the App Store,


108
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,892 line:-2
you may be interested
in marketing your pre-order app or


109
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:02,362 line:-2
in tracking the performance
of your pre-orders.


110
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,398 line:-1
To market your pre-order app,


111
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,900 line:-1
you can use these localized badges


112
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,803 line:-2
on your website or
in your marketing materials


113
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,506 line:-2
to directly link people
to your product page.


114
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,476 line:-2
Pre-order apps
are discoverable through search as well,


115
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:22,549 line:-2
and may be featured on the Today,
Games, or Apps tabs on the App Store.


116
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:26,887 line:-2
The performance of your pre-orders
can be tracked from within App Analytics,


117
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,459 line:-2
where you can find the number of purchased
pre-orders by date and by region.


118
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,795 line:-1
And, with these new updates,


119
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,297 line:-1
you'll be able to run custom product pages


120
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:41,468 line:-2
and product page optimization tests
for any pre-order app.


121
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:45,339 line:-2
The performance of your custom
product pages and optimization tests


122
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,342 line:-2
can also be tracked
from within App Analytics.


123
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:53,313 line:-2
So to wrap up, these updates
will give you more flexibility overall


124
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:57,351 line:-2
in choosing where and how
you publish your apps for pre-order.


125
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:02,122 line:-2
You can use App Store Connect
to set up and manage these pre-orders.


126
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,825 line:-2
And finally,
the functionality that I covered


127
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:08,896 line:-2
will be supported by
the App Store Connect API as well.


128
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,299 line:-2
