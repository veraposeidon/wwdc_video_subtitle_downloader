00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.352 line:-1 align:center
I am here to help you with language.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:22.055 line:-2 align:center
Today we'll unlock the power
of grammatical agreement.


7
00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.759 line:-2 align:center
Language in software
impacts our daily interaction with it.


8
00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.428 line:-1 align:center
The words in your app matter.


9
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,898 line:-1
Handling language in software can be hard,


10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,567 line:-2
especially when
you don't speak that language.


11
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:38,872 line:-4
In 2021, we introduced new APIs
in Foundation that help your apps


12
00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:40.674 line:-3 align:center
with grammatical agreement.


13
00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:45.846 line:-2 align:center
Today, I'd like to introduce new features
in Foundation that will unlock


14
00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.882 line:-2 align:center
a different level
of user experience for your apps


15
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:53,153 line:-2
through natural language
that is grammatically more correct,


16
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,390 line:-1
better sounding, and more inclusive.


17
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,158 line:-1
So let's dive in.


18
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:02,095 line:-2
We'll start with a very short recap
of why we think


19
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,731 line:-2
handling grammatical agreement
is important.


20
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,367 line:-2
We'll walk you
through different examples in languages


21
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:11.104 line:-1 align:center
that we've added support for since 2021.


22
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,474 line:-2
We'll talk about new APIs
in grammatical agreement space


23
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,711 line:-1
and introduce dependency agreement.


24
00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.414 line:-2 align:center
We went one step further
and asked ourselves,


25
00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:23.317 line:-2 align:center
how can we help you
make the language in your app


26
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,554 line:-2
not just more grammatically correct,
but also more inclusive?


27
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:32,259 line:-2
Grammar should not be something you should
worry about when you build your app.


28
00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:37.030 line:-2 align:center
We believe well-designed APIs
can help ease the linguistic complexity


29
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,966 line:-1
and help you scale.


30
00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.902 line:-2 align:center
Rich and grammatically correct words
in your UI


31
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,706 line:-2
make the user experience flawless
and enjoyable.


32
00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.909 line:-2 align:center
Different languages present
their own set of challenges.


33
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,980 line:-2
All of this linguistic complexity
is what we take into consideration


34
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,516 line:-1
when we design new APIs.


35
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:01,088 line:-2
Our goal is to pack all that into simple,
easy-to-use interfaces.


36
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.324 line:-2 align:center
Let's briefly review
how grammatical agreement enhances


37
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,761 line:-2
user experience throughout the system
in different languages.


38
00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:12.766 line:-2 align:center
New APIs introduced in 2021
let you specify a range of words


39
00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.303 line:-2 align:center
that need to change
based on users' preferred term of address,


40
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,006 line:-2
as well other words
within the inflectable range.


41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,576 line:-5
If a user selects
a feminine term of address,


42
00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.879 line:-5 align:center
iPhone will greet her
in a feminine setting in Spanish


43
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:29,049 line:-5
when she's setting up
her phone for the first time.


44
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:32,352 line:-5
Last year,
three more languages joined Spanish.


45
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:36,123 line:0
French speaking users enjoy
a more personalized experience


46
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,259 line:0
when they choose
to select their term of address.


47
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:43,530 line:0
The software throughout the system
will change the words to reflect that,


48
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,567 align:center
just like this example in the Notes app.


49
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.204 line:-2 align:center
Personalized strings are pervasive
across the system experience.


50
00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:53.207 line:-2 align:center
Setting up your phone,
working with Shared Notes,


51
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.975 line:-1 align:center
or managing your Calendar,


52
00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.744 line:-2 align:center
the language is adapting
to match your settings,


53
00:02:57.778 --> 00:03:02.249 line:-2 align:center
just like here,
in Italian or Brazilian Portuguese.


54
00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:05.452 line:-1 align:center
This year, we've added support


55
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,720 line:-1
for grammatical agreement


56
00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.288 line:-1 align:center
to two new locales:


57
00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:12.059 line:-1 align:center
European Portuguese and German.


58
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:15,162 line:-2
Now let's talk about what's new
in grammatical agreement


59
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.097 line:-1 align:center
in Foundation this year.


60
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.335 line:-2 align:center
Languages are complex,
but good APIs are not.


61
00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:26.573 line:-2 align:center
Very often, words in the UI need to change
their form based on another word.


62
00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:29.877 line:-2 align:center
To help you visualize it,
let me walk you through an example


63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,145 line:-1
from our food ordering app.


64
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,614 line:-1
This is Spanish.


65
00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:38.085 line:-2 align:center
In Spanish, adjectives need
to agree with the nouns they describe.


66
00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:41.488 line:-2 align:center
Here, the food size "pequeño"
needs to agree


67
00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:44.391 line:-1 align:center
with the food it describes, "ensalada."


68
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,861 line:-2
This is a very common use case
in other languages as well,


69
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:51.999 line:-2 align:center
where word agreement happens
between certain parts of speech.


70
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,868 line:-2
And since these words
are separated in the UI,


71
00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:57.871 line:-2 align:center
handling this kind
of agreement is not easy.


72
00:03:57.905 --> 00:04:03.243 line:-2 align:center
We created a new API that fixes this type
of dependency agreements easily.


73
00:04:03.277 --> 00:04:07.214 line:-2 align:center
The fix is very simple
and requires very few code changes.


74
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:12,486 line:-2
Here, we want a string containing
the food size, "pequeño,"


75
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,988 line:-1
to agree with the food name, "ensalada."


76
00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:19.359 line:-2 align:center
This year, we are introducing
a new property to LocalizationOptions,


77
00:04:19.393 --> 00:04:24.298 line:-2 align:center
concepts, which allows us to specify
objects that affect grammatical agreement,


78
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:28.769 line:-2 align:center
but are not formatted
into the strings like arguments are.


79
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:33,307 line:-2
We use a localizedPhrase concept
for a string value we want to agree with,


80
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.742 line:-1 align:center
in this case, "ensalada."


81
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.145 line:-1 align:center
Lastly, we need to annotate the word


82
00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:41.381 line:-2 align:center
that needs inflection
with agreeWithConcept.


83
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:46,320 line:-2
A value of 1 here means that we
are asking for grammatical agreement


84
00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:49.489 line:-2 align:center
with the first object
in the concepts array.


85
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,960 line:-1
Note that we use 1-based indexing.


86
00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:56.496 line:-2 align:center
The agreeWithConcept attribute
is also new this year,


87
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,434 line:-2
but you can use it
even if your app runs on older devices.


88
00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.904 line:-2 align:center
When that is the case,
we will simply ignore the attribute.


89
00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:09.009 line:-2 align:center
Now that we've introduced these changes,
let's take a look at our UI.


90
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:14,181 line:-2
Observe that the word "pequeño"
has changed to "pequeña."


91
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:18,952 line:-2
This is the correct form to use
when describing "ensalada" in Spanish.


92
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:23,190 line:-2
Now let's look at other places
where we need linguistic enhancements.


93
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:30,097 line:-2
Here in the sentence "Our salad contains
lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and ham,"


94
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.234 line:-2 align:center
the Spanish words "nuestro"
and "hecho" both need to agree


95
00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:36.737 line:-1 align:center
with the noun "ensalada."


96
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.907 line:-2 align:center
Luckily, we only need
to facilitate grammatical agreement


97
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,310 line:-2
within the string,
so we don't need any code changes.


98
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:47.548 line:-2 align:center
First, let's make "nuestro" agree
with the food by annotating it


99
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,249 line:-1
with the inflect attribute.


100
00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:52.853 line:-2 align:center
When we use the inflect attribute
on a block that has an argument,


101
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:57,591 line:-2
it will try to make every word
grammatically agree with the argument.


102
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:02,129 line:-2
However, there is one more
word we need to inflect, "hecho."


103
00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:06.366 line:-2 align:center
We try to keep inflect blocks as short
as possible to help with ambiguity,


104
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.003 line:-2 align:center
so we cannot annotate "hecho"
with inflect: true.


105
00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:15.142 line:-2 align:center
This year, we are introducing another
new attribute called agreeWithArgument.


106
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,778 line:-1
Unlike agreeWithConcept,


107
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,947 line:-2
where you need
to make changes to the code base


108
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,082 line:-1
by passing the value of the food name,


109
00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:24.218 line:-1 align:center
the agreeWithArgument attribute


110
00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:28.155 line:-2 align:center
does not require any code changes
and is an easy way


111
00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:32.226 line:-2 align:center
to facilitate agreement
not possible with the inflect attribute.


112
00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.864 line:-2 align:center
We can use agreeWithArgument
to indicate that "hecho" should agree


113
00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:40.200 line:-2 align:center
with an argument
that is elsewhere in the string.


114
00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:44.471 line:-2 align:center
Here, a value of 1 means
that we want the word to agree


115
00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:47.474 line:-1 align:center
with the first argument in the string.


116
00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:51.512 line:-2 align:center
With these changes made,
let's take a look at the UI again.


117
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,684 line:-2
Now both words are formatted
to grammatically agree with "ensalada,"


118
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:01,355 line:-2
and we use fully correct Spanish
in our localization.


119
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:05,926 line:-2
Next, let's look at a similar
but yet different example.


120
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,195 line:-1
This is French.


121
00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:13.834 line:-2 align:center
In French, demonstrative adjectives need
to agree with the nouns they describe.


122
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:18,372 align:center
Notice that the sizes,
as well as the button with the quantity,


123
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,274 line:0
are already fixed for Spanish


124
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:24,545 align:center
as we applied agreeWithConcept
and inflect attributes.


125
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,114 line:0
Let's fix this demonstrative case
in French.


126
00:07:27.147 --> 00:07:28.882 line:-1 align:center
The fix is really easy.


127
00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:33.353 line:-2 align:center
Wrap both the adjective and the argument
with an inflect: true block


128
00:07:33.387 --> 00:07:35.422 line:-1 align:center
and let the Engine do its magic.


129
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:40,160 align:center
Et voila, grammatically correct food
just tastes better.


130
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:45,065 align:center line:-2
To recap, dependency agreement
makes it possible to change words


131
00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:47.968 line:-1 align:center position:49%
based on other words they depend on.


132
00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:52.172 line:-2 align:center
Use agreeWithConcept attribute
when you want a word to agree


133
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:57,044 position:49% line:-2
with another word or phrase that does not
exist within the same sentence.


134
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:02,482 line:-2
Use agreeWithArgument attribute for
situations where you want a word to agree


135
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:06,820 position:49% line:-2
with another word or phrase,
and both of them are in the same string.


136
00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:11.325 line:-2 align:center
Now let's talk about new APIs
for Inclusive language.


137
00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:14.628 line:-1 align:center
Let's take a look at our Caffé app again.


138
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,098 align:center
Let's say,
we've picked a small sandwich


139
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,901 align:center
and a small juice for our lunch
and put in an order.


140
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:24,838 align:center
Since we're really hungry, we want
to check the status of our delivery.


141
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:28,041 align:center
It looks like Tony is delivering
our order soon.


142
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:33,080 line:0
When localizing user interface, it's good
practice to use gender-neutral language .


143
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,616 line:0
At the same time,
using gendered language


144
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,486 align:center
in the UI feels more personal
and sounds more natural.


145
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,922 align:center
Let's try to personalize this string
for Tony,


146
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,224 align:center
who uses he and him pronouns.


147
00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:48.462 line:-2 align:center
First, we need to change
the model for the delivery person


148
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,532 line:-2
to include
their preferred term of address.


149
00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:54.067 line:-2 align:center
To represent that,
we add a new property


150
00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:57.538 line:-2 align:center
of type TermOfAddress,
which is new this year.


151
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:04,044 align:center line:-2
Then, we can set the term of address
to any of masculine, feminine, or neutral.


152
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:09,917 position:49% line:-2
Since we want to refer to Tony using
he and him pronouns, we choose masculine.


153
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:15,422 line:-2
Next, we need to annotate the strings
where pronouns need to change.


154
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,759 line:-2
To do that, we use the new
referentConcept attribute.


155
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:23,630 line:-2
A value of 1 indicates
that the referent of the pronoun


156
00:09:23.664 --> 00:09:27.067 line:-2 align:center
should be the first concept
in the LocalizationOptions.


157
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,238 line:-2
You can apply referentConcept
to any third-person personal pronoun,


158
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:35,509 line:-2
and the engine will figure out
what to replace it with.


159
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:40,214 line:-2
Now let's pass a termsOfAddress inflection
concept when inflecting the string.


160
00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:44.651 line:-2 align:center
We assign this to the concepts
property of LocalizationOptions,


161
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,721 line:-2
just like we did earlier
for grammatical agreement.


162
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:51.024 line:-2 align:center
Let's see how
this changes our UI in English.


163
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:57,364 line:-2
Notice how "their" and "they" have
been replaced by "his" and "he."


164
00:09:57.397 --> 00:10:01.802 line:-2 align:center
You can use the same localized string
to refer to other people too.


165
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,471 line:-2
Use a feminine term of address
when you want to refer


166
00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:07.875 line:-1 align:center
to someone using she and her pronouns.


167
00:10:07.908 --> 00:10:11.144 line:-2 align:center
And use a neutral term
of address when you want to refer


168
00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:14.848 line:-1 align:center
to someone using they and them pronouns.


169
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:19,887 line:-2
You can also further personalize pronouns
by using localized term of address.


170
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.990 line:-2 align:center
In a localized term of address,
you have to specify


171
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,560 line:-2
the language it applies to,
in this case, English.


172
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,863 line:-2
And list all pronoun forms
that you wish to use


173
00:10:29.897 --> 00:10:33.233 line:-1 align:center
using the new Morphology.Pronoun type.


174
00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:36.403 line:-2 align:center
In English,
we have to list five pronouns.


175
00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:40.941 line:-2 align:center
Each Pronoun consists of the pronoun form
in the target language,


176
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,278 line:-2
and a Morphology
describing when it should be used.


177
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,447 line:-2
Please refer to our documentation
for detailed instructions


178
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,450 line:-1
on constructing pronouns.


179
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:55,923 line:-2
Using this API is a great way to enhance
the personalization of your app.


180
00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:58.425 line:-2 align:center
We use this technique
to tailor the language used


181
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,427 line:-1
in localized strings in iOS.


182
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,631 align:center
Now let me show how all these new features
are working live in a demo.


183
00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:08.902 line:-2 align:center
I hope everyone is hungry for some
delicious food from our Caffè app now.


184
00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:10.704 line:-1 align:center
Let me launch it in Spanish.


185
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,544 line:-1
Let's see what's on the menu.


186
00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:20.848 line:-1 align:center
Let's order a pizza this time.


187
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:25.819 line:-2 align:center
Here is the same grammar issue
we just discussed.


188
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:30,357 line:-2
In Spanish, determiners and adjectives
need to agree with nouns.


189
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,562 line:-2
To make two words agree with each other,
we can use inflect: true attributes.


190
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:40,167 line:-2
So let's apply this easy fix
to the words "nuestro" and "pizza."


191
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,737 line:-2
First, let's locate this string
in our String Catalog.


192
00:11:52.346 --> 00:11:55.449 line:-2 align:center
To make "nuestro" agree
with the argument "pizza,"


193
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:59,152 line:-2
we enclose both of them
in an inflect: true block.


194
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,226 line:-2
Next, let's also fix the adjective
"hecho" that needs to agree


195
00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.896 line:-1 align:center
with "pizza" in the same sentence.


196
00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:12.366 line:-2 align:center
We want to use
agreeWithArgument attribute here.


197
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.335 line:-2 align:center
We generally try
to keep the inflect: true block


198
00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:18.805 line:-2 align:center
as short as possible
to help with ambiguity.


199
00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.708 line:-2 align:center
Because "hecho"
is distant from the inflect block,


200
00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:25.612 line:-2 align:center
we need to use
"agreeWithArgument" attribute this time.


201
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,351 line:-2
The value of 1 here indicates
that we want "hecho" to agree


202
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:35,956 line:-2
with the first argument in the string,
in this case, "pizza."


203
00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:38.392 line:-1 align:center
Let's run our app again.


204
00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:48.468 line:-2 align:center
Now this looks like a great
localization experience in Spanish.


205
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:52,339 line:-2
Now let's see how we can use
the new agreeWithConcept attribute


206
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,108 line:-1
to fix up the food sizes here.


207
00:12:55.142 --> 00:13:00.080 line:-2 align:center
Since pizza is feminine, the adjective
that describes it should be "pequeña."


208
00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:07.821 line:-2 align:center
We have already defined
the localizedNames for the food sizes.


209
00:13:07.855 --> 00:13:11.625 line:-2 align:center
To fix the agreement,
we want to convert localizedNames


210
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:16,597 line:-2
into a method that agrees
with the specific food item.


211
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:21,969 line:-2
Next, we want to pass the food name
when formatting the SIZE_BUTTON.


212
00:13:22.002 --> 00:13:27.140 line:-2 align:center
Here, we will define the new property
to LocalizationOptions, concept.


213
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,577 line:-2
Concepts are objects
that affect grammatical inflection


214
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:35,015 line:-2
but are not interpolated
into strings the way that arguments are.


215
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,652 line:-1
Here, we use the localizedPhrase concept


216
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:42,623 line:-2
to insert the string that we want
to grammatically agree with.


217
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,528 line:-1
And we should remember to use options,


218
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:50.597 line:-2 align:center
which is defined
when initializing the string.


219
00:13:55.602 --> 00:13:58.805 line:-2 align:center
Next, we want to modify
our Spanish string catalog.


220
00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:09.116 line:-2 align:center
We want to annotate this
with the new attribute agreeWithConcept.


221
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,728 line:-2
Here the value of 1 indicates
that we want this argument to agree


222
00:14:21.762 --> 00:14:25.933 line:-2 align:center
with the first concept
we passed to the LocalizationOptions.


223
00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:30.404 line:-2 align:center
Lastly, let's update the FoodSizeView,
where the user selects the size


224
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:33,106 line:-2
of the pizza they want,
with the new method.


225
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:39,179 line:-2
Now let's run our app again
and finally order the pizza.


226
00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:45.619 line:-2 align:center
Amazing, our food sizes are
correctly agreeing with the pizza here.


227
00:14:45.652 --> 00:14:49.623 line:-2 align:center
Let's try sandwich,
which is masculine in Spanish.


228
00:14:49.656 --> 00:14:51.725 line:-1 align:center
This looks great.


229
00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:54.228 line:-1 align:center
Now let's launch our app in English,


230
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.897 line:-1 align:center
and finally put an order for a pizza.


231
00:15:03.837 --> 00:15:06.907 line:-1 align:center
I will opt for a huge one this time.


232
00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:10.010 line:-1 align:center
And let's make it two. Why not?


233
00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:15.082 line:-2 align:center
Looks like Tony is going
to deliver our order soon.


234
00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:17.317 line:-1 align:center
The gender neutral language here is great,


235
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:21,722 line:-2
but we happen to know that Tony
set his pronouns to be he/him/his.


236
00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.991 line:-1 align:center
This is something we could easily fix.


237
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:27,060 line:-2
To do that, let's extend the model
for the delivery person


238
00:15:27.094 --> 00:15:29.596 line:-1 align:center
to include preferredTermsofAddress.


239
00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:40.007 line:-2 align:center
And let's extend our instance
of Tony and indicate that he prefers


240
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.442 line:-1 align:center
to use masculine pronouns.


241
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,549 line:-1
Next, we want to change the string itself.


242
00:15:52.853 --> 00:15:56.356 line:-2 align:center
Here, we want to substitute "they"
with the pronoun depending


243
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.293 line:-2 align:center
on the termsOfAddress
of the delivery person.


244
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:02,796 line:-2
To do this, we use
the new referentConcept attribute.


245
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:11,371 line:-2
Here the value of 1 means
that the referent of the pronoun "they"


246
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:15,309 line:-2
has to be the first concept
which passed in LocalizationOptions.


247
00:16:16.743 --> 00:16:21.748 line:-2 align:center
We can apply this to any third person
personal pronoun in this sentence.


248
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:35.662 line:-2 align:center
Next, we want to pass the termsOfAddress
as a concept in LocalizationOptions.


249
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:39,499 line:-2
Let's initialize LocalizationOptions
for deliveryMessage.


250
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,340 line:-2
Here, we can
also use termsOfAddress concept


251
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:50,911 line:-2
to provide termsOfAddress
that we can use for grammatical agreement.


252
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:02,756 line:-2
And lastly,
let's use the new LocalizationOptions


253
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,058 line:-1
when we initialize the string.


254
00:17:07.928 --> 00:17:10.964 line:-1 align:center
Now let's try running our app again.


255
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:19,039 line:-1
Okay, huge pizzas, two.


256
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,908 line:-1
Let's make it three.


257
00:17:24.278 --> 00:17:26.246 line:-1 align:center
Now that we've applied the agreement,


258
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.582 line:-1 align:center
this looks so much more personal.


259
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.453 line:-2 align:center
There are a lot of great new features
in Foundation this year,


260
00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:36.957 line:-2 align:center
and they are ready
for you to try in your apps today.


261
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,460 line:-2
Inflect: true supports
even more languages this year.


262
00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:44.198 line:-2 align:center
Our new dependency agreement APIs
will help you agree words


263
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:48,402 line:-2
within same string,
or even completely out of context.


264
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:53,807 line:-2
Finally, the new termsOfAddress inflection
concept and referentConcept attributes


265
00:17:53.841 --> 00:17:58.145 line:-2 align:center
in Markdown will help
make your language be more personalized.


266
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:02,049 line:-2
Please refer to our documentation
for language-level support.


267
00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:04.318 line:-1 align:center
I hope you'll love these new features.


268
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:08.589 line:-2 align:center
We're looking forward to seeing them
beautify the language in your apps soon.


269
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:09,890 line:-1
Thank you.


270
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:13,927 line:-2
Oh, and my pizza has arrived.
Thank you, Tony.
