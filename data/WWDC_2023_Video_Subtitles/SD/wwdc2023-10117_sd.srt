Hi, and welcome to "What's new
in App Store Connect."


5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,718 line:-1
I'm Laurel McAndrews from
App Store Connect Engineering.


6
00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:19.419 line:-1 position:50%
Today, I'll walk through
the developer lifecycle


7
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,255 line:-1
in App Store Connect,
and I'll call out


8
00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.857 line:-1 position:50%
some enhancements
we're making this year.


9
00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.860 line:-1 position:50%
I'll begin with some ways to
think about monetizing your app,


10
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.428 line:-1 position:50%
implementing in-app purchases,


11
00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.531 line:-1 position:50%
and how to set prices
internationally.


12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,034 line:-1
Then, I'll review
how to manage testers


13
00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.736 line:-1 position:50%
and some of the improvements
we've made


14
00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:38.605 line:-1 position:50%
to managing builds and testers.


15
00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:41.275 line:-1 position:50%
I'll cover getting ready
for going live on the App Store,


16
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:44,511 line:-1
and ways to build excitement
for your app.


17
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:48.181 line:-1 position:50%
Last, I'll walk through ways
to use the App Store Connect API


18
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:52,085 line:-1
to speed up your release cycle
and customize workflows.


19
00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:56.056 line:-1 position:50%
First, let's talk about
monetizing your app.


20
00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.058 line:-1 position:50%
As you're working on your app,
you'll consider


21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,662 line:-1
whether to include in-app
purchases and how to set prices.


22
00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:04.631 line:-1 position:50%
Whether you're a solo developer
doing everything yourself,


23
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:07.100 line:-1 position:50%
or a large company
with a dedicated pricing team,


24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,569 line:-1
there are features this year
to help you run your business


25
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,705 line:-1
on the App Store.


26
00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:15.309 line:-1 position:50%
For example, StoreKit
for SwiftUI is a new capability


27
00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:18.345 line:-1 position:50%
that allows you to quickly and
easily offer in-app purchases


28
00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.914 line:-1 position:50%
and subscriptions in your app.


29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,283 line:-1
After you set up products
in App Store Connect,


30
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,585 line:-1
you can go into Xcode and add
a few lines of code


31
00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:29.156 line:-1 position:50%
to generate views in your app
to offer in-app purchases.


32
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,791 line:-1
These pages are fully accessible


33
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.526 line:-1 position:50%
and localize
your project strings


34
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,895 line:-1
into all App Store languages.


35
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,697 line:-1
You can choose
the simplest implementation


36
00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:39.132 line:-1 position:50%
of StoreKit for SwiftUI.


37
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,802 position:50%
Or you can customize elements
like backgrounds, buttons,


38
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:47,040 position:50%
and styles to achieve a design
that is seamless with your app.


39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,810 line:0
If you promote your in-app
purchases on the App Store,


40
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,013 line:0
you even have the option to use
the App Store promotion image


41
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,816 line:0
in the product view in your app.


42
00:01:55.816 --> 00:02:00.120 line:-1 position:50%
This icon will appear alongside
the in-app purchase in your app.


43
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.689 line:-1 position:50%
If you offer in-app purchases
or if you choose to offer


44
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,926 line:-1
a paid app, you will need
to consider how to set prices


45
00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:09.129 line:-1 position:50%
and how they will translate
to international markets.


46
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.465 line:-1 position:50%
This spring, we upgraded
our pricing capabilities,


47
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,067 line:-1
making it easier
to manage the prices of apps,


48
00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:17.204 line:-1 position:50%
in-app purchases,
and subscriptions.


49
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:20,307 line:-1
This update allows you
to choose from 900 price points


50
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,111 line:-1
to give you flexibility
on the pricing of your app;


51
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:26.413 line:-1 position:50%
set a base region,
which is the ability to choose


52
00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:29.082 line:-1 position:50%
one region to automatically
generate prices


53
00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:32.552 line:-1 position:50%
across other regions
and currencies;


54
00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:35.155 line:-1 position:50%
manage international pricing,
which allows the App Store


55
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.458 line:-1 position:50%
to adjust your prices
as currencies or taxes change


56
00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.695 line:-1 position:50%
or manage them manually
on your own;


57
00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:43.697 line:-1 position:50%
and set the availability
of in-app purchases


58
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:46,366 line:-1
and subscriptions by region.


59
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,802 line:0
To begin implementing
StoreKit for SwiftUI,

"Meet StoreKit for SwiftUI."


61
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,940 position:50%
To go in-depth
on this year's pricing changes


62
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,675 line:0
as well as
the new pricing endpoints


63
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,477 position:50%
in the App Store Connect API,


64
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,747 line:0
visit "What's new
in App Store pricing."


65
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:05,752 line:-1
Next up, let's talk about ways
to manage testers for your app.


66
00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:08.188 line:-1 position:50%
Once you have an idea
of how to monetize your app,


67
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.557 line:-1 position:50%
you'll start thinking about
who your testers will be


68
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,860 line:-1
and how you'll test changes
before releasing.


69
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,530 position:50%
TestFlight makes it easy
to test your prerelease builds


70
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,904 line:0
on iOS, watchOS, tvOS,
macOS, and now xrOS.


71
00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:26.306 line:-1 position:50%
This year, we're making it
easier to manage testers,


72
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,576 line:-1
builds, and test different
use cases in your app.


73
00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.144 line:-1 position:50%
We want to help you
get the right builds


74
00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.780 line:-1 position:50%
to the right testers and ensure
you can test scenarios


75
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.184 line:-1 position:50%
that users will encounter when
you release on the App Store.


76
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,352 line:-1
TestFlight provides data
about your testers


77
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,489 line:-1
to help you understand
how engaged they are.


78
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,592 line:0
This data includes a status,
which tells whether a tester


79
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,028 line:0
has been invited,
if they've accepted,


80
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,297 position:50%
or if they've installed a build,


81
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,033 line:0
the number of sessions
the tester has had,


82
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,701 position:50%
the number of crashes,


83
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:59,005 line:0
and amount of TestFlight
feedback they have provided.


84
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,308 position:50%
We're adding an additional
column for devices


85
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,877 position:50%
which will show the most recent
device and OS


86
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,713 position:50%
on which the beta app
was installed.


87
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,683 position:50%
We're also adding the ability
to filter by tester data


88
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:13,253 position:50%
in order to view and manage
segments of testers.


89
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,189 line:0
You will be able to bulk select
groups of testers


90
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,426 position:50%
in order to resend invitations,
add to a group,


91
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,062 line:0
or remove testers altogether.


92
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,064 position:50%
And all of this data
will be available


93
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:27,134 position:50%
through
the App Store Connect API.


94
00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:29.469 line:-1 position:50%
Once you're able to easily
manage your testers,


95
00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.705 line:-1 position:50%
you may want to put release
controls in place to make sure


96
00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:35.041 line:-1 position:50%
you're sending the right builds
to the right people.


97
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,943 line:-1
When distributing a build
from Xcode,


98
00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.912 line:-1 position:50%
you may have a build
like a prototype


99
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,748 line:-1
that you never want to go
outside of your internal team.


100
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,317 line:-1
For this, we're adding
a TestFlight Internal Only


101
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:49,156 line:-1
selection to the new
distribution workflow in Xcode.


102
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,625 line:-1
When you make this selection,
it will ensure that these builds


103
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,627 line:-1
can't be released
for External TestFlight


104
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,796 line:-1
and can't be submitted
for App Store review.


105
00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:59.533 line:-1 position:50%
In App Store Connect, these
builds will be clearly marked


106
00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:03.537 line:-1 position:50%
so you can easily see which
builds can be distributed where.


107
00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:05.138 line:-1 position:50%
If you have
a good group of testers


108
00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.474 line:-1 position:50%
and the right builds
going to the right places,


109
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,410 line:-1
you also need to tell testers
what you want them to check out


110
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,045 line:-1
in your app.


111
00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.414 line:-1 position:50%
Xcode Cloud will make
this process even easier


112
00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:15.982 line:-1 position:50%
with the ability to upload


113
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:20,287 line:-1
TestFlight What to Test
information alongside a build.


114
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:23,223 line:-1
To do this,
you have a few options.


115
00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:26.259 line:-1 position:50%
You can add a plain text file
to a TestFlight folder


116
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,130 line:-1
located in the same folder as
your Xcode project or workspace.


117
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.865 line:-1 position:50%
This file will itemize
the things


118
00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:34.134 line:-1 position:50%
you want testers to check out.


119
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:38,104 line:-1
Or you pull from commit messages
with a custom build script.


120
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,540 line:-1
This information will be passed
to App Store Connect


121
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.275 line:-1 position:50%
and will be distributed
to your testers


122
00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:45.478 line:-1 position:50%
when you're ready
to start testing your build.


123
00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:48.281 line:-1 position:50%
Now that you've optimized
your build and tester management


124
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.916 line:-1 position:50%
in TestFlight,
let's talk about


125
00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:53.386 line:-1 position:50%
some new features
in sandbox testing.


126
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,522 line:-1
Family Sharing allows
your customers to share


127
00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.657 line:-1 position:50%
your subscriptions
and in-app purchases


128
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,492 line:-1
with their Family Group.


129
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,596 line:-1
To enable you to test
this feature before you release,


130
00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:06.032 line:-1 position:50%
we are adding the ability
to combine sandbox test accounts


131
00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.134 line:-1 position:50%
into a Family Group.


132
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,370 line:-1
Just like Family Sharing
in the App Store,


133
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.040 line:-1 position:50%
you can group up to six
test accounts into a family.


134
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,009 line:-1
You will be able to configure
these accounts


135
00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.878 line:-1 position:50%
in App Store Connect.


136
00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.814 line:-1 position:50%
This year, we're adding
the following sandbox


137
00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:23.850 line:-1 position:50%
on-device enhancements on iOS.


138
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.153 line:-1 position:50%
View Family Group members
and select to stop sharing


139
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:31,958 line:-1
an autorenewable subscription
or nonconsumable with a family.


140
00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.362 line:-1 position:50%
Modify the renewal rate
of a subscription.


141
00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:39.432 line:-1 position:50%
Test interrupted purchases,
and clear purchase history


142
00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:42.102 line:-1 position:50%
right on the test device.


143
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,137 position:50%
To expand on
these testing topics,

150
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,293 line:-1
After you have your app tested,
you'll think about


151
00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:08.962 line:-1 position:50%
how to represent your app
on the App Store.


152
00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:12.832 line:-1 position:50%
Let's cover some ways
to build your store presence.


153
00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.668 line:-1 position:50%
Your product page
is where you tell customers


154
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,603 line:-1
about the features in your app.


155
00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.406 line:-1 position:50%
App Store Connect helps you

and acquire customers.

App Store privacy
nutrition labels


158
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,482 line:0
summarize your data practices
in a simple, easy-to-read label


159
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,685 position:50%
so that customers
can make an informed decision


160
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,220 position:50%
when downloading your app.


161
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,123 line:-1
When answering app privacy
questions in App Store Connect,


162
00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.959 line:-1 position:50%
you need to indicate
in the data collection section


163
00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.896 line:-1 position:50%
the types of data
you collect from customers.


164
00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:45.031 line:-1 position:50%
With the introduction of xrOS,


165
00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.334 line:-1 position:50%
we are adding
a few new data types.


166
00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:49.202 line:-1 position:50%
You should select
Environment Scanning


167
00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:52.439 line:-1 position:50%
if you collect data on a user's
surroundings,


168
00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:56.142 line:-1 position:50%
Hands if collect hand structure
or movements,


169
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,712 line:-1
or Head if you collect
head movement.


170
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,915 line:-1
For example, if your app
teaches users how to play piano


171
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,917 line:-1
and collects data
on the movement of their hands


172
00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:06.286 line:-1 position:50%
in order to instruct them,
you should select


173
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:10,056 line:-1
the Hands data type
for data collection.


174
00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:12.158 line:-1 position:50%
These new data types
will be especially relevant


175
00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:15.628 line:-1 position:50%
for xrOS apps, but could apply
on other platforms.


176
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,697 line:-1
For example,
these would apply to you


177
00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:22.168 line:-1 position:50%
if you use ARKit on iOS
and collect these types of data.


178
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:25.238 line:-1 position:50%
These new data types will appear
on the xrOS App Store


179
00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:28.708 line:-1 position:50%
and all other platforms
where your app is released.


180
00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:31.478 line:-1 position:50%
After you've inputted your
answers to privacy questions,


181
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,947 line:-1
you can start thinking
of when you'll release your app


182
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:37,050 line:-1
and how you'll present yourself
to customers.


183
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.119 line:-1 position:50%
Now let's talk about pre-orders.


184
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,421 line:-1
Releasing your app for pre-order
can be a powerful way


185
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,989 line:-1
to build awareness
and excitement


186
00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.824 line:-1 position:50%
for your upcoming app release.


187
00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.793 line:-1 position:50%
This year, we're giving you
the flexibility


188
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,596 line:-1
to use pre-orders
on a regional basis.


189
00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:51.698 line:-1 position:50%
This means you can start
by launching your app


190
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,366 line:-1
to a limited set of regions,


191
00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.335 line:-1 position:50%
often referred to
as a soft launch,


192
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:59,305 line:-1
and also offer your app
for pre-order in other regions.


193
00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:02.575 line:-1 position:50%
We're making this possible with
a redesigned availability page,


194
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,545 line:-1
where you can manage your app's
state across regions.


195
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.947 line:-1 position:50%
You'll be able to launch
your app and tune your design


196
00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:11.918 line:-1 position:50%
and functionality before using
pre-order in new markets.


197
00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:14.687 line:-1 position:50%
Whether your app is available
for pre-order or download,


198
00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.823 line:-1 position:50%
you might want to think about
which metadata is right


199
00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:18.758 line:-1 position:50%
to display
on your product page.


200
00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:22.295 line:-1 position:50%
For this you can use
product page optimization.


201
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,764 line:-1
Product page optimization
gives you insight


202
00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:27.567 line:-1 position:50%
into which product pages
your users like best.


203
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,869 line:-1
This year, we're making
a change so that tests


204
00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:32.806 line:-1 position:50%
will continue to run until
you choose to stop them,


205
00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:35.975 line:-1 position:50%
and won't be affected
by new versions.


206
00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:38.978 line:-1 position:50%
You will be able to view and
monitor a currently running test


207
00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:41.514 line:-1 position:50%
while pushing updates
to your app as needed.


208
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,783 line:-1
Keep in mind that a test
is meant to compare treatments


209
00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:46.519 line:-1 position:50%
against your control,
so any changes to a product page


210
00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:51.057 line:-1 position:50%
with a new version could impact
the results of a running test.


211
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,026 line:-1
To continue building
your store presence,


212
00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:55.028 line:-1 position:50%
here are some other sessions.


213
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,696 line:-1
To get your app ready for xrOS


214
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,399 line:-1
outside of our new
data collection options,


215
00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:03.102 line:-1 position:50%
visit "Explore App Store Connect
for spatial computing."


216
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,472 position:50%
To go deeper on privacy,
including our new features


217
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:09,876 line:0
for third party SDKs,
visit "What's new in privacy."


218
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,878 position:50%
To better understand pre-order
by region,


219
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,214 line:0
including our redesigned
availability tab,


220
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,817 position:50%
visit "What's new
in App pre-order."


221
00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:20.353 line:-1 position:50%
Once you have your app
in the hands of customers,


222
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:24,357 line:-1
you can explore how to automate
with the App Store Connect API.


223
00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:25.992 line:-1 position:50%
The App Store Connect API


224
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,561 line:-1
provides options
for customizing workflows,


225
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.663 line:-1 position:50%
staying in sync
with your internal systems,


226
00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:33.967 line:-1 position:50%
and automating processes
to save time.


227
00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.969 line:-1 position:50%
Our API collections allow you


228
00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.905 line:-1 position:50%
to automate many areas
of the App Store.


229
00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:42.208 line:-1 position:50%
This year, we launched in-app
purchases and subscriptions,


230
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,143 line:-1
customer reviews and responses,


231
00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.779 line:-1 position:50%
and the ability to manage
sandbox testers.


232
00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:48.882 line:-1 position:50%
We have some great releases
coming this year,


233
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,217 line:-1
including support
for Game Center.


234
00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:53.586 line:-1 position:50%
These APIs will make it
easier and faster


235
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,090 line:-1
to set up Game Center features
and build consistent experiences


236
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.360 line:-1 position:50%
across all platforms
of your game.


237
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,563 line:-1
Let's go into detail
about what these APIs entail.


238
00:11:03.563 --> 00:11:07.066 line:-1 position:50%
You can create, configure,
and even archive leaderboards


239
00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:10.270 line:-1 position:50%
and achievements just as
you would in App Store Connect.


240
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,771 line:-1
Archiving is a new feature


241
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:15,275 line:-1
to remove leaderboards
and achievements from your game.


242
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,510 line:-1
Submit scores
and achievement unlock events


243
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,946 line:-1
via a server-to-server API.


244
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,981 line:-1
This is great if you are
a cross-platform game


245
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:25,251 line:-1
that manages data
across many platforms.


246
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,453 line:-1
Remove scores and players
from your leaderboards


247
00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:30.790 line:-1 position:50%
to automate management
of fraudulent activity.


248
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.126 line:-1 position:50%
Last, match players
using custom rules


249
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,827 line:-1
like skill level or region,


250
00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:37.730 line:-1 position:50%
an upgrade to our matchmaking
capabilities.


251
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.033 line:-1 position:50%
In addition to bringing
Game Center to the API,


252
00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:43.436 line:-1 position:50%
we also have some updates
to API authentication.


253
00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:44.971 line:-1 position:50%
This year,
you can generate


254
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:47.840 line:-1 position:50%
marketing and customer service
API keys


255
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,877 line:-1
if you'd like to limit keys to
manage your marketing metadata


256
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,913 line:-1
or respond to App Store reviews.


257
00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:56.349 line:-1 position:50%
You can also create
a user-based key,


258
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,619 line:-1
which is an API key that has
the same permissions as you do,


259
00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:01.788 line:-1 position:50%
regardless of what role
you have.


260
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,090 line:-1
You'll be able to do this
from your user profile


261
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,659 line:-1
in App Store Connect.


262
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,294 line:-1
We covered a lot
in this session,


263
00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:11.397 line:-1 position:50%
and these new features are just
a subset of the developer tools


264
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,066 line:-1
for the App Store.


265
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,968 line:-1
Whether you're building
an app for the first time,


266
00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:16.502 line:-1 position:50%
you're an experienced
developer,


267
00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:19.105 line:-1 position:50%
you're building by yourself,
or you're part of a team,


268
00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:22.141 line:-1 position:50%
App Store Connect can help you
put the best version of your app


269
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,210 line:-1
on the App Store.


270
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,946 line:-1
To wrap up, I encourage you
to try out


271
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,116 line:-1
some of these new capabilities
and tell us what you think.


272
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,352 line:-1
If you run into issues,
you can contact us


273
00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:34.020 line:-1 position:50%

for unlimited support
via phone and email.


275
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,393 line:-1
We provide support in nine
languages, 24 hours a day.


276
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,928 line:-1
I encourage you
to submit feedback


277
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,496 line:-1
with the Feedback Assistant.


278
00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:45.398 line:-1 position:50%
Whether it's for App Store
Connect, TestFlight,


279
00:12:45.398 --> 00:12:48.034 line:-1 position:50%
or the App Store Connect API,
our team reviews


280
00:12:48.034 --> 00:12:50.970 line:-1 position:50%
every piece of feedback
that comes in.


281
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,205 line:-1
Thanks for watching.


282
00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:54.707 line:-1 position:50%
I'm excited to see
what you build next.
