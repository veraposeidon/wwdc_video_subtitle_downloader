Sophia: Hello, and welcome
to "Generalize APIs with parameter packs."


4
00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:17.985 line:-2
My name is Sophia,
and I work on the Swift compiler team.


5
00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.721 line:-2
Today I will be talking to you
about Swift parameter packs


6
00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:25.259 line:-2
and how they provide a new dimension
of flexibility with generic programming.


7
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:30,664
This is an advanced talk, and it builds
upon the existing generics system.


8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,366
If you are unfamiliar with the topic,


9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,004
I encourage you to watch
"Embrace Swift generics" from WWDC22.


10
00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.940 line:-2
Today, I will walk you through
the types of problems


11
00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.009 line:-1
that parameter packs can solve,


12
00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.812 line:-2
how to think about parameter packs
when you encounter them in libraries,


13
00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.948 line:-2
and finally,
I will dive into how to implement


14
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:51.485 line:-2
your own code
that utilizes parameter packs.


15
00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:55.522 line:-2
Before I jump into parameter packs,
it is important to know why they exist.


16
00:00:55.556 --> 00:01:00.594 line:-2
So I will begin by talking a little bit
about generics and then variadics.


17
00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:04.731 line:-2
The code you write is
fundamentally composed of two categories:


18
00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.467 line:-1
values and types.


19
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.970 line:-2
You can abstract over values
by writing functions


20
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.273 line:-2
that accept different values
as parameters.


21
00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:16.109 line:-2
An example could be
a radians(from:) function


22
00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:20.480 line:-2
that as input will accept
any Double value representing degrees


23
00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:25.485 line:-2
and for output will return
a new Double value representing radians.


24
00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:28.689 line:-2
You can abstract over types
by writing generic code


25
00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:31.525 line:-2
that accepts varying types
for its parameters.


26
00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.795 line:-2
For example,
the standard library Array type


27
00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:39.333 line:-2
is designed to hold any form of data
that you might wish to fill it with.


28
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:42.903 line:-2
It has an Element type parameter
which is a placeholder


29
00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:47.474 line:-2
for the concrete type that you will use
for a given instance of an Array.


30
00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:51.311 line:-2
In both cases,
concrete values or concrete types


31
00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.947 line:-2
are passed as arguments
to the abstraction.


32
00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:59.119 line:-2
Most generic code abstracts
over both types and values.


33
00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:03.790 line:-2
To explore this, I am going to write
some code to send queries to a server.


34
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:09.530 line:-2
Its basic implementation will receive
a Request of some Payload type,


35
00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:12.065 line:-2
then it will pass that
as a query to the server,


36
00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.003 line:-2
and finally return a server response
of type Payload.


37
00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:18.405 line:-1
The function has one parameter,


38
00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:21.808 line:-2
but I want to support querying
multiple requests in the same call.


39
00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:26.980 line:-2
For the ability to have a variable number
of arguments, we have variadic parameters.


40
00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:31.218 line:-2
Variadic parameters allow
for a function to flexibly accept


41
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:34.454 line:-1
any number of arguments of a single type.


42
00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:37.157 line:-1
But variadic parameters have limitations.


43
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.961 line:-2
For example,
you might want to map the given arguments


44
00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:45.365 line:-2
to a tuple whose length is the same
as the number of arguments.


45
00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.602 line:-2
However, with variadic parameters,
there is no way to declare


46
00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:52.039 line:-2
a return type that is based
on the argument length.


47
00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:56.777 line:-2
There also is no way for variadic
parameters to accept varying types


48
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.614 line:-2
without using type erasure,
and therefore no way to preserve


49
00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:04.151 line:-2
the specific static type information
of each argument.


50
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:08.989 line:-2
What we lack with the generics system
and variadic parameters is the ability


51
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:14.695 line:-2
to both preserve type information
and vary the number of arguments.


52
00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:18.031 line:-2
Today, the only way to do this
is with overloading,


53
00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:22.903 line:-2
which forces you to choose an upper bound
of the number of arguments you support.


54
00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:26.907 line:-2
I wonder, will two parameters be enough?
Probably not.


55
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.843 line:-1
Handling up to three parameters is better.


56
00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:31.812 line:-1
But what if we want four?


57
00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:35.649 line:-2
This overloading pattern,
as well as its limitations, are pervasive


58
00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:40.153 line:-2
across APIs that conceptually handle
varying numbers of type parameters.


59
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,956
This approach has
the downside of redundancy,


60
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,394
but more importantly, it forces
choosing an arbitrary upper limit


61
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,397
to the number of arguments
that will be supported.


62
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,801
Exceeding whatever limit was chosen
will result in a compiler error


63
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,537
about extra arguments.


64
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.807 line:-2
This is the kind of problem
that parameter packs solve.


65
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:04.444 line:-2
If you find yourself
falling into this overloading pattern,


66
00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:08.282 line:-2
then that is a strong sign
that you want to use parameter packs.


67
00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:12.786 line:-2
In Swift 5.9, the generics system
is gaining first class support


68
00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.888 line:-1
for abstraction over argument length


69
00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:18.759 line:-2
with a new construct
called "parameter packs."


70
00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:21.461 line:-2
I'm now going to talk
about what parameter packs mean


71
00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:24.131 line:-1
when you see them in APIs.


72
00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:28.168 line:-2
In code, most of the time,
you work with a single type or value.


73
00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:32.539 line:-2
A parameter pack can hold
any quantity of types or values


74
00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:37.077 line:-2
and pack them together to pass them
as an argument to a function.


75
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.682 line:-2
A pack that holds individual types
is called a type pack.


76
00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:44.885 line:-2
For example,
you could have a type pack that holds


77
00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:49.523 line:-2
three individual types:
Bool, Int, and String.


78
00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:54.428 line:-2
A pack that holds individual values
is called a value pack.


79
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:57.564 line:-2
For example,
you could have a value pack that holds


80
00:04:57.598 --> 00:05:02.302 line:-2
three individual values: true,
the number 10, and an empty string.


81
00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:05.472 line:-2
Type packs and value packs
are used together.


82
00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:08.742 line:-1
A type pack provides each individual type


83
00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:12.012 line:-1
for each individual value in a value pack.


84
00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:15.749 line:-2
The corresponding type and value
are at the same position


85
00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.518 line:-1
in their respective packs.


86
00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:22.523 line:-2
At position 0,
the type of the value true is Bool.


87
00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:27.561 line:-2
At position 1, the type
of the integer literal 10 is Int.


88
00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:32.032 line:-2
And at position 2, the type
of the empty string literal is String.


89
00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:35.802 line:-2
Parameter packs allow you
to write one piece of generic code


90
00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:39.139 line:-2
that works with every individual element
in a pack.


91
00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:42.342 line:-2
This concept might sound familiar
because you're already used


92
00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:46.046 line:-2
to writing one piece of code that works
with different, individual elements


93
00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:48.415 line:-1
when you use Collections in Swift.


94
00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:51.618 line:-2
The way that you write such code
is through iteration.


95
00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:54.855 line:-1
For example, the body of a for-in loop


96
00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:58.392 line:-2
operates on each individual element
of an array.


97
00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:03.030 line:-2
What makes parameter packs different
from collections is that each element


98
00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:06.033 line:-1
in the pack has a different static type,


99
00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:08.836 line:-2
and you can work with packs
at the type-level.


100
00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:11.405 line:-2
Normally,
you write generic code that works


101
00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:16.777 line:-2
with different concrete types by declaring
a type parameter inside angle brackets.


102
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.381 line:-2
In Swift 5.9, you can declare a pack
of type parameters


103
00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:24.084 line:-1
with the keyword "each".


104
00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:26.687 line:-1
Instead of having a single type parameter,


105
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.425 line:-2
the function accepts each Payload type
that you want to query.


106
00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:34.728 line:-1
This is called a type parameter pack.


107
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:39.366 line:-2
In order for the names of type packs
and value packs to read naturally,


108
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:43.270 line:-2
use a singular naming convention,
such as "each Payload"


109
00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:45.839 line:-1
rather than "each Payloads".


110
00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:48.775 line:-1
Generic code that uses parameter packs


111
00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:53.780 line:-2
can operate on each Payload individually
using repetition patterns.


112
00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:57.784 line:-2
A repetition pattern is expressed
using the 'repeat' keyword,


113
00:06:57.818 --> 00:07:00.888 line:-2
followed by a type
called the pattern type.


114
00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:19.106 line:-2
with individual pack elements
at every iteration.


115
00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:22.176 line:-2
Let's see how this replacement works
with a concrete type pack


116
00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:24.811 line:-1
containing Bool, Int, and String.


117
00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:27.581 line:-1
The pattern will be repeated three times


118
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:31.685 line:-2
and the placeholder 'each Payload'
is replaced with the concrete type


119
00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:34.521 line:-1
in the pack during each repetition.


120
00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:37.891 line:-2
The result is
a comma-separated list of types:


121
00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:42.462 line:-2
Request of Bool, Request of Int,
and Request of String.


122
00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:47.367 line:-2
Because repetition patterns produce
comma-separated lists of types,


123
00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:52.873 line:-2
they can only be used in positions that
naturally accept comma-separated lists.


124
00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:56.243 line:-2
This includes types
wrapped in parentheses,


125
00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:59.780 line:-2
which are either a tuple type
or a single type.


126
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:03.150 line:-2
Additionally, they can be used
in function parameter lists,


127
00:08:03.183 --> 00:08:07.054 line:-2
and repetition patterns can be used
in generic argument lists.


128
00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:11.692 line:-2
Using a repetition pattern
as the type of a function parameter


129
00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:16.663 line:-2
turns that function parameter
into a value parameter pack.


130
00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:21.835 line:-2
This enables the caller to pass in
an arbitrary number of Request instances,


131
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:27.040 line:-2
and the argument values will be collected
into a pack and passed to the function.


132
00:08:27.074 --> 00:08:30.477 line:-2
That covers the fundamental concept
of parameter packs


133
00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:32.646 line:-1
and the syntax that is used.


134
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.149 line:-2
Next, to demonstrate
how they can simplify as well as extend


135
00:08:36.183 --> 00:08:40.120 line:-2
the functionality of APIs,
let's return to our query API.


136
00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:58.172 line:-2
Each overload has 1, 2, 3,
and 4 type parameters, respectively.


137
00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:01.942 line:-2
Each overload maps each type parameter
to a Request


138
00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:04.545 line:-1
over that type in the parameter list.


139
00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:09.716 line:-2
And each overload contains a list
of each type parameter in the return type.


140
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.387 line:-2
Using parameter packs,
these 4 overloads can be collapsed


141
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.756 line:-1
down into a single function.


142
00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:18.825 line:-2
Let's first consider
the type parameter declarations,


143
00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:22.496 line:-2
then the function parameter list,
and finally the return type.


144
00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:27.634 line:-2
Each type parameter can be collapsed down
into a type parameter pack.


145
00:09:27.668 --> 00:09:33.507 line:-2
Each individual Request parameter can be
collapsed down to a value parameter pack.


146
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.944 line:-2
And the return type can be collapsed down
into a tuple


147
00:09:36.977 --> 00:09:40.247 line:-2
constructed by repeating
each Payload type.


148
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.115 line:-1
Now you have one query function


149
00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:44.818 line:-2
that can handle
any number of request arguments.


150
00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:49.756 line:-2
Because the function parameter
and return type are both dependent types


151
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.960 line:-1
of the type parameter pack 'each Payload,'


152
00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:56.129 line:-2
you know that the length
of the function's value parameter pack


153
00:09:56.163 --> 00:10:00.267 line:-2
will always match the number of elements
in the tuple that is returned.


154
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.637 line:-2
Now that I have adopted
parameter packs in this API,


155
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.674 line:-2
you can call this single query function
with one argument


156
00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:10.577 line:-2
or with three arguments
or any amount you wish.


157
00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:13.580 line:-2
Parameter packs handle
all argument lengths the same way.


158
00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:17.150 line:-2
Let's focus on the call
with three arguments.


159
00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:21.054 line:-2
The concrete argument pack is inferred
from the arguments at the call-site.


160
00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:24.625 line:-2
Every concrete type
for the placeholders 'each Payload'


161
00:10:24.658 --> 00:10:28.428 line:-2
is collected from the argument list
into a type pack.


162
00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:33.700 line:-2
And the concrete type pack is
substituted in to produce the return type.


163
00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:38.672 line:-2
'each Payload' appears
in the parameter list and the return type.


164
00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:52.119 line:-2
In the end, the code that is run
is equivalent to an iteration


165
00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:55.122 line:-1
over all three types of the type pack.


166
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:04.531 line:-2
Suppose that our query payloads
should be Equatable.


167
00:11:04.565 --> 00:11:08.135 line:-2
By adding a colon
and the protocol name Equatable


168
00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.404 line:-1
following the type parameter pack,


169
00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:15.375 line:-2
every element in the Payload pack is
required to conform to Equatable.


170
00:11:15.409 --> 00:11:18.846 line:-2
More general requirements can be
declared with a 'where' clause,


171
00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:20.948 line:-1
just like ordinary generics.


172
00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:25.552 line:-2
Remembering that parameter packs
can contain zero or more arguments,


173
00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:28.422 line:-2
you may be thinking
that this server query API


174
00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:32.059 line:-2
has no particular reason
to accept zero arguments.


175
00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:36.530 line:-2
Fortunately, there is a simple technique
to require a minimum argument length.


176
00:11:36.563 --> 00:11:40.367 line:-2
In this case,
I want to require at least one argument,


177
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.970 line:-1
to give the function something to do.


178
00:11:43.003 --> 00:11:46.240 line:-2
To achieve this,
I add a regular type parameter


179
00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:48.642 line:-1
preceding the type parameter pack


180
00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:53.180 line:-2
and a corresponding value parameter
preceding the value parameter pack.


181
00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.516 line:-1
Any constraints on the type parameter pack


182
00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:58.418 line:-2
should be applied
to the new type parameter as well,


183
00:11:58.452 --> 00:12:01.588 line:-2
which, in this example,
is conformance to Equatable.


184
00:12:01.622 --> 00:12:05.559 line:-2
Now callers to your function
must provide at least one argument.


185
00:12:05.592 --> 00:12:07.694 line:-2
At this point,
we have covered the foundation


186
00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:12.065 line:-2
of what parameter packs solve
and how to read them in an API.


187
00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:16.670 line:-2
Next, let's go over how to implement code
that uses parameter packs.


188
00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:20.107 line:-2
We're going to build out
the implementation of the server query


189
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.942 line:-1
using parameter packs.


190
00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:25.012 line:-1
The query function accepts a value pack


191
00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:27.814 line:-2
where every individual element
is a Request


192
00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:30.817 line:-1
over every element in the type pack.


193
00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:51.104 line:-1
for every item in the value pack.


194
00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:54.842 line:-2
You can express this
using repetition patterns.


195
00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:58.612 line:-2
Repetition patterns are expressed
using the same syntax


196
00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:01.281 line:-1
at the type-level and at the value-level.


197
00:13:01.315 --> 00:13:06.920 line:-2
At the value level, the 'repeat' keyword
is followed by the pattern expression.


198
00:13:06.954 --> 00:13:10.991 line:-2
The pattern expression will contain
one or more value packs.


199
00:13:11.024 --> 00:13:14.228 line:-2
The pack is iterated
through every value it contains,


200
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:17.197 line:-2
and the expression is evaluated
once per value.


201
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:21.768 line:-2
To produce a list of all evaluation
results contained within a tuple,


202
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:25,105
you can wrap the pattern expression
in parentheses.


203
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,742
If the value pack that is passed
to the function is empty,


204
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,144
the result will be the empty tuple.


205
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:36,049
If the value pack has a single element,
the result will be another single value.


206
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:40,721
If the value pack has multiple elements,
the result will be a tuple.


207
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:41,822
And that's it.


208
00:13:41.855 --> 00:13:45.826 line:-2
Now, we have a query function
that accepts a value pack of results,


209
00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:48.495 line:-1
evaluates every individual request,


210
00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:52.866 line:-2
and returns the result
of every request together in a tuple.


211
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.905 line:-2
This is the foundation of how you make use
of parameter packs in your code.


212
00:13:57.938 --> 00:14:01.441 line:-2
This continues to be far less code
than the earlier example


213
00:14:01.475 --> 00:14:04.978 line:-2
that used multiple overloads
rather than parameter packs,


214
00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:08.615 line:-2
and that version didn't even have
an implementation.


215
00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:11.652 line:-2
Maintenance is easier,
and errors that often arise


216
00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.987 line:-1
from repetitive code patterns are gone.


217
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:16.890 line:-1
Now let's add a little more flexibility.


218
00:14:16.924 --> 00:14:22.829 line:-2
I'm going to refactor my example
to: enable the query API to store state,


219
00:14:35.342 --> 00:14:37.277 line:-1
and lift the type parameter pack


220
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:40.247 line:-2
from the query method
to the Evaluator type.


221
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.117 line:-2
The Evaluator struct can store
the request pack in a stored property


222
00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:47.487 line:-2
by wrapping it in parentheses
to make it a tuple value.


223
00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:50.924 line:-2
Given a concrete Payload type
argument pack,


224
00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.228 line:-2
the 'item' variable will either be
a single request


225
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:57.064 line:-1
or a tuple of every request.


226
00:14:57.097 --> 00:15:00.801 line:-2
Next, I'll change Request
from a struct to a protocol


227
00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:04.171 line:-1
that has an associated type named Output.


228
00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:09.042 line:-2
And I will add another associated type
to the Request protocol named Input.


229
00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:12.279 line:-2
I will then update
the evaluate method in Request


230
00:15:12.312 --> 00:15:15.282 line:-2
to make its argument
the protocol's Input type.


231
00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:17.417 line:-1
This enables the method's return type


232
00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:20.320 line:-2
to differ from that
of the argument's type.


233
00:15:20.354 --> 00:15:23.190 line:-2
After this,
I update the Evaluator to require


234
00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:26.793 line:-1
all Payload types to conform to Request


235
00:15:26.827 --> 00:15:30.464 line:-2
and correspondingly update
the 'item' stored property


236
00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:33.567 line:-1
to now be simply of type 'each Payload.'


237
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.170 line:-1
However, at this point, the name "Payload"


238
00:15:36.203 --> 00:15:40.274 line:-2
for Evaluator's type parameter pack
doesn't really fit.


239
00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:43.844 line:-2
Payload is no longer
what is contained within a Request


240
00:15:43.877 --> 00:15:46.914 line:-2
but instead conforms
to the entirety of Request.


241
00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:50.450 line:-2
Therefore, we will change
the name of Payload to be Request


242
00:15:50.484 --> 00:15:53.887 line:-2
and the name of the protocol
to be RequestProtocol.


243
00:15:53.921 --> 00:15:58.325 line:-2
The query method can now accept
a pack of each Request's Input type,


244
00:15:58.358 --> 00:16:02.596 line:-2
and it will return a list
of each Request's Output type.


245
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:06.400 line:-2
Finally, the new parameter 'input'
to the query method


246
00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:08.902 line:-2
simply needs to be passed along
to the calls


247
00:16:08.936 --> 00:16:11.171 line:-1
to every item's evaluate method.


248
00:16:11.205 --> 00:16:14.007 line:-2
Now we are able to have
a different type returned


249
00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:17.077 line:-2
from the server's response
than the type of data


250
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.179 line:-1
that we include inside our query.


251
00:16:19.213 --> 00:16:22.883 line:-2
You can know that the length
of the method's value argument pack


252
00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:26.053 line:-2
will match the length of the value pack
that is returned


253
00:16:40.434 --> 00:16:43.403 line:-2
if you were to want to exit early
from the iteration.


254
00:16:43.437 --> 00:16:45.906 line:-2
Perhaps it is the case
that the consequences


255
00:16:45.939 --> 00:16:48.809 line:-2
of a collection of queries
should only take effect


256
00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.811 line:-1
if every query is successful.


257
00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:53.514 line:-1
Throwing errors can be used for this.


258
00:16:53.547 --> 00:16:57.384 line:-2
In our example, you could update
RequestProtocol's evaluate method


259
00:16:57.417 --> 00:16:58.852 line:-1
to be a throwing function


260
00:16:58.886 --> 00:17:02.022 line:-2
and modify the return type
of Evaluator's query method


261
00:17:02.055 --> 00:17:03.423 line:-1
to be optional.


262
00:17:03.457 --> 00:17:07.394 line:-2
You can move the body of the query method
into a do-catch statement,


263
00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:10.330 line:-2
placing the return statement
within the do clause


264
00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:12.666 line:-1
and returning nil from the catch clause.


265
00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:17.204 line:-2
Now any individual query's evaluation
is able to halt iteration


266
00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:20.274 line:-2
over all of the queries,
if that might be needed.


267
00:17:20.307 --> 00:17:24.444 line:-2
In this session, we have talked
about how parameter packs allow you


268
00:17:24.478 --> 00:17:29.449 line:-2
to abstract over types as well as
the number of arguments in generic code.


269
00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:32.085 line:-2
We walked through
how you can use parameter packs


270
00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:35.556 line:-2
to both simplify and remove limitations
in your code


271
00:17:35.589 --> 00:17:38.125 line:-1
by writing a single generic implementation


272
00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:41.695 line:-2
that previously would have required
numerous overloads.


273
00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:44.598 line:-2
Finally, we wrote code
to implement sending queries


274
00:17:44.631 --> 00:17:48.035 line:-2
to a server
while utilizing parameter packs.


275
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,736
To learn more about generics,


276
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,541
check out the session
"Embrace Swift generics" from WWDC22.


277
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,511
And to learn more about protocols
and type erasure,


278
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:01,148
check out the session
"Design protocol interfaces in Swift"


279
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,483
from WWDC22.


280
00:18:03.517 --> 00:18:07.688 line:-2
Swift parameter packs are a powerful tool
to expand what is possible


281
00:18:07.721 --> 00:18:10.390 line:-2
in your generic code
while also enabling you


282
00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:13.293 line:-1
to simplify common generic patterns.


283
00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:15.429 line:-2
We can't wait to see
what you build with them.


284
00:18:15.462 --> 00:18:17.097 line:-1
Thank you for watching.
