David Johnson:
Hello, everyone.


5
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,380 line:-1
Welcome to "What's New
in Safari Extensions."


6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.448 line:-1 position:50%
My name is David Johnson,


7
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,650 line:-1
and I'm a Safari extensions
engineer here at Apple.


8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,620 line:-1
Today, I'm excited to tell you
about some recent developments


9
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.488 line:-1 position:50%
in Safari extensions,
highlighting improvements


10
00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:24.258 line:-1 position:50%
to the user experience
and new features.


11
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,026 line:-1
First, we want to thank you
for creating


12
00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.295 line:-1 position:50%
and sharing the over
2000 Safari extensions


13
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,530 line:-1
available on
the App Store today.


14
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.299 line:-1 position:50%
Demand for
Safari extensions on iOS


15
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.767 line:-1 position:50%
has been especially impressive.


16
00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.936 line:-1 position:50%
They're often among the top
categories on the App Store


17
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,939 line:-1
since their introduction
at WWDC21.


18
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,908 line:-1
Your extensions empower
users to customize


19
00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:45.112 line:-1 position:50%
their browsing experience
across macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.


20
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,047 line:-1
There are four ways
to build Safari extensions:


21
00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.149 line:-1 position:50%
content blockers,
share extensions,


22
00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.618 line:-1 position:50%
app extensions,
and web extensions.


23
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,421 line:-1
Safari 17 continues to support
all of these types,


24
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,223 line:-1
but the future
of browser customization


25
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,991 line:-1
lies in web extensions.


26
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,127 line:-1
Apple is dedicated
to standardizing web extensions


27
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,162 line:-1
alongside the other
major browser vendors.


28
00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:04.798 line:-1 position:50%
This collaboration aims
to improve compatibility,


29
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,266 line:-1
streamline development,


30
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.036 line:-1 position:50%
and ensure a familiar experience
across all browsers.


31
00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:10.137 line:-1 position:50%
We're working together


32
00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:12.606 line:-1 position:50%
in the W3C WebExtensions
Community Group,


33
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,342 line:-1
where Apple proudly serves
as a cochair.


34
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,411 line:-1
By connecting with other browser
and extension developers


35
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,079 line:-1
to drive this
standardization effort,


36
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,881 line:-1
we're building a stronger
and more unified


37
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,183 line:-1
web extension ecosystem.


38
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,584 line:-1
Before jumping
into today's topics,


39
00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.986 line:-1 position:50%
I'd like to share
two key details


40
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,956 line:-1
about Safari web extensions.


41
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:32,759 line:-1
First, Safari 17 will continue
to support both Manifest v2


42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,861 line:-1
and v3 web extensions.


43
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,097 line:-1
We'll continue to add
new features to Manifest v3,


44
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,434 line:-1
so update when it makes sense
for your extension.


45
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,703 line:-1
Second, web extensions
are the best way


46
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,639 line:-1
to build extensions for Safari
across platforms.


47
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,741 line:-1
With a single shared codebase,
web extensions allow you


48
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,510 line:-1
to customize the capabilities
of Safari on iOS,


49
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.715 line:-1 position:50%
iPadOS, macOS, and now xrOS.


50
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,851 line:-1
That's right, web extension
available on iOS and iPadOS


51
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,554 line:-1
will also be available on xrOS.


52
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,223 line:-1
Web extensions on xrOS
work just like you'd expect


53
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,892 line:-1
and have the same capabilities
as extensions on iOS,


54
00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.894 line:-1 position:50%
including the ability
to inject scripts,


55
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,298 line:-1
run background content,
and display popovers.


56
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,999 line:-1
We're excited to see
how your extensions


57
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,702 line:-1
enhance the browsing
experience on xrOS.


58
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,704 position:50%
To learn more about
Safari on xrOS,


59
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,641 line:0
check out
"Meet Safari for xrOS."


60
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,276 line:-1
With those announcements
out of the way,


61
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,313 line:-1
here's what we'll cover
in the rest of today's session.


62
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,216 line:-1
First, we'll delve into some
new and updated extension APIs


63
00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:30.984 line:-1 position:50%
and how they enhance
the capabilities


64
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.220 line:-1 position:50%
of Safari extensions.


65
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.988 line:-1 position:50%
Then we'll cover
per-site permissions


66
00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:38.158 line:-1 position:50%
for Safari app extensions,
offering users more control


67
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.894 line:-1 position:50%
over their browsing experience.


68
00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.363 line:-1 position:50%
And finally, we'll take a look
at how to ensure compatibility


69
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:47,000 line:-1
with both Safari Profiles
and Private Browsing.


70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,937 line:-1
Up first,
new extension APIs.


71
00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.507 line:-1 position:50%
Content blockers are a great way
to clean up web pages,


72
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,176 line:-1
remove annoyances,
and block loading of scripts.


73
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.012 line:-1 position:50%
Content blockers use rules
defined in JSON to block or hide


74
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.248 line:-1 position:50%
content without needing
access to any information


75
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,617 line:-1
about what websites are visited.


76
00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.586 line:-1 position:50%
Declaratively hiding content
on web pages can be tricky.


77
00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:10.057 line:-1 position:50%
That's why content blockers
now support :has() selectors.


78
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,992 line:-1
:has() selectors are great
because they allow


79
00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:14.361 line:-1 position:50%
your content blocker to
precisely target parent elements


80
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,196 line:-1
based on their children.


81
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.532 line:-1 position:50%
In this rule example,
we're hiding any elements


82
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,068 line:-1
with the class .post that
also have a child element


83
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,537 line:-1
with the class .paid-promo.


84
00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.372 line:-1 position:50%
Extensions that hide
webpage content,


85
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.940 line:-1 position:50%
or block network requests,


86
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.276 line:-1 position:50%
are some of the most popular
types of extensions.


87
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,144 line:-1
That's why Safari continues
to support you


88
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,046 line:-1
in creating innovative
and effective extensions


89
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,048 line:-1
that offer a secure and private
browsing experience


90
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,184 line:-1
for your users.


91
00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:39.553 line:-1 position:50%
If you're looking to block
or modify network requests


92
00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:40.921 line:-1 position:50%
with a web extension,


93
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:42.222 line:-1 position:50%
you should check out
these updates


94
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,724 line:-1
to Declarative Net Request.


95
00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.693 line:-1 position:50%
Declarative Net Request
is a powerful API


96
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,662 line:-1
that provides a way
for your web extension


97
00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:52.132 line:-1 position:50%
to block and modify
network requests.


98
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,568 line:-1
Like content blockers,
your extension provides rules


99
00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.838 line:-1 position:50%
in a JSON format
and Safari handles the rest.


100
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,673 line:-1
This means enhanced
power efficiency,


101
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,777 line:-1
especially on
battery-powered devices.


102
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,245 line:-1
Since these rules
are declarative,


103
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,613 line:-1
your extension
doesn't need access


104
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,248 line:-1
to webpages the user visits,


105
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:11.384 line:-1 position:50%
increasing their privacy
and security.


106
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,186 line:-1
One big update
to Declarative Net Request


107
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,789 line:-1
in Safari 16.4
is that your extension


108
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,425 line:-1
can now modify request headers.


109
00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.093 line:-1 position:50%
In this example,
I've defined an action


110
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,028 line:-1
that sets a custom
User-Agent header


111
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,731 line:-1
for all requests made
to example.com.


112
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.400 line:-1 position:50%
Beyond setting headers, this
action type can modify headers


113
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,103 line:-1
by adding new values,
removing existing values,


114
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,571 line:-1
or even removing
headers entirely


115
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:35,775 line:-1
from HTTP requests.


116
00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.844 line:-1 position:50%
Modifying network requests
is a powerful tool,


117
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,347 line:-1
and there are some key points
to keep in mind.


118
00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:41.548 line:-1 position:50%
First, you must declare


119
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,017 line:-1
the declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess permission


120
00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.186 line:-1 position:50%
in the manifest.


121
00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:49.222 line:-1 position:50%
In Safari 16.4, this permission
is now also required


122
00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.591 line:-1 position:50%
for redirect actions.


123
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,793 line:-1
Your extension must also
be granted per-site permissions


124
00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:57.631 line:-1 position:50%
for any modify headers or
redirect actions to be applied.


125
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,766 line:-1
This ensures that the user
has control over their data


126
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,835 line:-1
on a site-by-site basis.


127
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,436 line:-1
By keeping these
considerations in mind,


128
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,172 line:-1
you can create powerful
and privacy-friendly


129
00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:06.640 line:-1 position:50%
content-blocking extensions


130
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,743 line:-1
that provide a tailored
experience for your users.


131
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:10,844 line:-1
If you're building an extension


132
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,579 line:-1
that uses
Declarative Net Request,


133
00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:13.980 line:-1 position:50%
you may want
to let your users know


134
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,783 line:-1
just how many requests
it has blocked.


135
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:17,817 line:-1
Using the new


136
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,354 line:-1
declarativeNetRequest.setExtensionActionOptions API,


137
00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:23.990 line:-1 position:50%
you can configure the badge text
to display action counts,


138
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,892 line:-1
such as the number
of blocked loads.


139
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,093 line:-1
In this example, we set the


140
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,263 line:-1
displayActionCountAsBadgeText
option to true,


141
00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:34.034 line:-1 position:50%
which is currently
the only option for this API.


142
00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:35.802 line:-1 position:50%
Your extension badge
will update automatically


143
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,538 line:-1
based on the actions taken.


144
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,307 line:-1
This allows your users
to easily monitor


145
00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:42.542 line:-1 position:50%
the extension's activity
and effectiveness,


146
00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:45.812 line:-1 position:50%
all while keeping
their browsing history private.


147
00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.714 line:-1 position:50%
Now I'll cover an update
to the scripting API


148
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,017 line:-1
that gives you more control over
the behavior of your extension.


149
00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.520 line:-1 position:50%
With the registerContentScript
set of APIs,


150
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,622 line:-1
you can create content scripts
that can be registered,


151
00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:58.158 line:-1 position:50%
updated, or removed
programmatically.


152
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,427 line:-1
This means that you can target
specific pages or conditions


153
00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:03.230 line:-1 position:50%
to apply to content scripts.


154
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,864 position:50%
In this example,
I'm registering a script


155
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,168 line:0
to be injected onto pages
that match webkit.org.


156
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,671 position:50%
This script registration will
also persist across sessions.


157
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,740 position:50%
This new API complements
the static content scripts


158
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,442 line:0
defined in
the extension manifest,


159
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,078 line:0
giving you greater flexibility
in managing content scripts


160
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,813 line:0
and enabling you
to create more advanced features


161
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,482 line:0
for your extensions.


162
00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:24.784 line:-1 position:50%
Safari 16.4 also brings
a new storage area


163
00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:27.988 line:-1 position:50%
to web extensions:
the session storage area.


164
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,789 line:-1
Storing and retrieving data
from session storage


165
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,593 line:-1
uses the same familiar functions
as other storage areas.


166
00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:35.428 line:-1 position:50%
This API allows you
to store data in memory


167
00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.097 line:-1 position:50%
for the duration
of your browser session,


168
00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:39.065 line:-1 position:50%
providing a fast and efficient
way to access data


169
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:42.335 line:-1 position:50%
between nonpersistent
background page loads.


170
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,536 line:-1
Unlike local storage,


171
00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.405 line:-1 position:50%
session storage is not
persisted to disk


172
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,540 line:-1
and it's cleared
when Safari quits.


173
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,476 line:-1
This makes session storage
particularly useful


174
00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:51.978 line:-1 position:50%
for storing sensitive
or security-related data,


175
00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:54.614 line:-1 position:50%
such as decryption keys
or authentication tokens,


176
00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:58.818 line:-1 position:50%
that should not be stored
in local storage.


177
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,687 line:-1
Finally, we know that
making sure your extension


178
00:07:00.687 --> 00:07:03.123 line:-1 position:50%
has all the right icon sizes
for different UI elements


179
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,791 line:-1
is a chore.


180
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,926 line:-1
That's why starting
in Safari 16.4,


181
00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.695 line:-1 position:50%
you can now create
a single SVG icon


182
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,964 line:-1
that looks beautiful
at any size.


183
00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:13.667 line:-1 position:50%
Safari will take care of scaling
your extension's icon sharply,


184
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,935 line:-1
letting you focus
on everything else.


185
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,871 line:-1
Those API updates are just
some of the improvements


186
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,939 line:-1
to Safari extensions this year.


187
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,741 line:-1
Now let's talk about
Safari app extensions


188
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,644 line:-1
and per-site permissions.


189
00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:26.379 line:-1 position:50%
If you're already familiar
with per-site permissions


190
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,480 line:-1
from web extensions,


191
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.716 line:-1 position:50%
they work the same way
for app extensions.


192
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,451 line:-1
Users are able to grant
extensions access


193
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.253 line:-1 position:50%
to websites as they browse,


194
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,222 line:-1
providing for better
privacy and control.


195
00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:37.824 line:-1 position:50%
When an extension
is first turned on,


196
00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:40.827 line:-1 position:50%
it won't have access to any
sites that the user visits.


197
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,330 line:-1
The first time an extension
tries to access the page,


198
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.265 line:-1 position:50%
Safari will badge
the extension's toolbar item


199
00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:47.200 line:-1 position:50%
alerting the user
that the extension wants access


200
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.968 line:-1 position:50%
to the current page.


201
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,704 line:0
When the user clicks
on that toolbar item,


202
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,138 position:50%
they'll be shown information
about what access


203
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,907 position:50%
the extension will have,
and be given the option


204
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:57,043 position:50%
to Allow for One Day,
or Always Allow.


205
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,145 line:0
When granted permission,
the extension's toolbar item


206
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,947 line:0
will be tinted to show
that the extension


207
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,450 position:50%
has access to the current page.


208
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.185 line:-1 position:50%
Anyone that upgrades
to Safari 17


209
00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:07.253 line:-1 position:50%
and already has
Safari app extensions turned on


210
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,290 line:-1
will have all permissions
migrated for those extensions.


211
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,092 line:-1
They'll also be shown a banner
giving them the option


212
00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:14.427 line:-1 position:50%
to increase their privacy.


213
00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:16.396 line:-1 position:50%
If Ask for Each Website
is chosen,


214
00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:18.865 line:-1 position:50%
all Safari app extension
permissions will be reset,


215
00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:20.800 line:-1 position:50%
and your users will be able
to grant your extension access


216
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.503 line:-1 position:50%
to each site as they visit.


217
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.905 line:-1 position:50%
There are no new APIs to adopt
to support this change


218
00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.874 line:-1 position:50%
in Safari 17; however,


219
00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.909 line:-1 position:50%
take some time to review
your extension's assumptions


220
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,313 line:-1
and test how your extensions
behave in Safari 17.


221
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,248 line:-1
Your users will have full
control over the websites


222
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,284 line:-1
every Safari app extension
can access.


223
00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:40.186 line:-1 position:50%
Your extension will
automatically have access


224
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,522 line:-1
to sites when permission
is granted by the user.


225
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:47.060 line:-1 position:50%
However, permissions can be
granted or revoked at any time.


226
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.696 line:-1 position:50%
Toolbar items are now shown
by default for all extensions.


227
00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:52.265 line:-1 position:50%
Take a look at how your
extension icon appears in Safari


228
00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.800 line:-1 position:50%
and supply a PDF vector icon


229
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.936 line:-1 position:50%
that can be
tinted appropriately.


230
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,439 line:-1
Finally, let's talk about
updates to how extensions work


231
00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:02.642 line:-1 position:50%
in both Profiles
and Private Browsing.


232
00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:05.945 line:-1 position:50%
In Safari 17, users will be able
to control which extensions


233
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,648 line:-1
have access to their Private
Browsing windows and tabs


234
00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:10.450 line:-1 position:50%
without needing to turn off
the extension


235
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,552 line:-1
in other browsing contexts.


236
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,087 line:-1
Extensions that inject scripts,


237
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,423 line:-1
or can read information
about the pages a user visits,


238
00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:18.658 line:-1 position:50%
are turned off by default.


239
00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:21.127 line:-1 position:50%
However, extensions
that don't access content,


240
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,328 line:-1
like content blockers,


241
00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:24.164 line:-1 position:50%
are automatically allowed
in Private Browsing


242
00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:27.333 line:-1 position:50%
because there aren't any
additional privacy concerns.


243
00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:30.236 line:-1 position:50%
Here's the updated Extensions
pane in Safari settings on macOS


244
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,539 line:-1
and there are
similar updates on iOS.


245
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,507 line:-1
There's a new option
to allow this extension


246
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,942 line:-1
in Private Browsing.


247
00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:37.343 line:-1 position:50%
For extensions
that are turned on,


248
00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:38.812 line:-1 position:50%
it's one click
in Safari settings


249
00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:42.315 line:-1 position:50%
to allow that extension access
to Private Browsing as well.


250
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,551 line:-1
Profiles are new
in Safari this year.


251
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,786 line:-1
They're a way to keep
browsing data separated.


252
00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:49.122 line:-1 position:50%
Profiles contain separate
history, cookies,


253
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,090 line:-1
and website data.


254
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.392 line:-1 position:50%
Users can also choose
which extensions


255
00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:54.327 line:-1 position:50%
they want to turn on
per profile.


256
00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:56.796 line:-1 position:50%
This includes new
tab page extensions.


257
00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:58.431 line:-1 position:50%
And of course,
all these settings sync


258
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:03,136 line:-1
across all of a user's iPhone,
iPad, and Macs through iCloud.


259
00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:04.637 line:-1 position:50%
The Extensions pane
in Safari settings


260
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,506 line:-1
has also been updated
to list the profiles


261
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,475 line:-1
where an extension is active.


262
00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:10.276 line:-1 position:50%
Here you can see that
the Sea Creator extension


263
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,646 line:-1
is active in both
Work and School profiles.


264
00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:15.381 line:-1 position:50%
When an extension
is turned on in a profile,


265
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,650 line:-1
it is an entirely new instance
of that extension.


266
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.220 line:-1 position:50%
This means each instance
will have a different UUID,


267
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,056 line:-1
background page,
and storage.


268
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,758 line:-1
However, per-site permissions
are shared across profiles.


269
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,193 line:-1
That means your users only need


270
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,996 line:-1
to grant your extension
access once.


271
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,364 line:-1
When running in a profile,


272
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,566 line:-1
an extension only has access
to the windows, tabs,


273
00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:36.436 line:-1 position:50%
and other data related
to that profile.


274
00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:38.771 line:-1 position:50%
If your extension communicates
with a native host app,


275
00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:40.640 line:-1 position:50%
make sure that your app expects
to receive messages


276
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.774 line:-1 position:50%
from multiple profiles


277
00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:45.311 line:-1 position:50%
and respects the separation
of data across those profiles.


278
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:48.515 line:-1 position:50%
When your app receives a call
to beginRequest(with context:),


279
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,416 line:-1
decode the userInfo dictionary.


280
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,452 line:-1
If your extension
is active in a profile,


281
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,554 line:-1
there will be
a profileIdentifier value


282
00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:59.425 line:-1 position:50%
for the key
SFExtensionProfileKey.


283
00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:01.728 line:-1 position:50%
Since extensions have
unique instances per profile,


284
00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:05.732 line:-1 position:50%
it's possible to inspect their
background content separately.


285
00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:07.433 line:-1 position:50%
From the Develop menu
in Safari 17,


286
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,468 line:-1
you can dive into


287
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,637 line:-1
the Web Extension
Background Content menu item


288
00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:12.572 line:-1 position:50%
and see the background pages
and service workers


289
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:13,940 line:-1
grouped by extension.


290
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.677 line:-1 position:50%
Each extension will list its
inspectable content per profile.


291
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,112 line:0
To learn more about
the improvements


292
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,947 line:0
to Safari developer
features this year,


293
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,615 line:0
check out
"What's new in Web Inspector"


294
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:26,553 position:50%
and "Rediscover Safari
developer features."


295
00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:29.589 line:-1 position:50%
In summary, Safari is committed
to standardizing web extensions


296
00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:31.824 line:-1 position:50%
and providing you with new APIs
to create innovative


297
00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:33.526 line:-1 position:50%
and effective extensions.


298
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,261 position:50%
We'd love for you to join
in the discussion


299
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,863 line:0
and help shape the future
of web extensions


300
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,532 line:0
by participating in the WECG.


301
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,501 position:50%
With per-site permissions
for app extensions


302
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,937 line:0
and support for new features
like :has() selectors,


303
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,872 position:50%
you can create extensions
that offer a secure


304
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,641 position:50%
and private browsing experience
for your users.


305
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,076 position:50%
Don't forget to update
your extensions


306
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,844 position:50%
to take advantage
of these new capabilities


307
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,546 line:0
and ensure they work well
with both Profiles


308
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,848 line:0
and Private Browsing.


309
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,551 line:0
And finally, provide feedback
through Feedback Assistant


310
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,721 line:0
as you test your extensions
in Safari 17.


311
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.457 line:-1 position:50%
Thank you for listening,
and have a great rest of WWDC.
