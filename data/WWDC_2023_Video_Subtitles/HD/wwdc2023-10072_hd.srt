Nathan Gitter: Welcome
to our session


5
00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.447 line:-1 position:50%
on the principles
of spatial design.


6
00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:14.681 line:-1 position:50%
I'm Nathan Gitter.


7
00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.049 line:-1 position:50%
Amy DeDonato: And I'm
Amy DeDonato,


8
00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.852 line:-1 position:50%
and we're designers
on the Apple Design team.


9
00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.054 line:-1 position:50%
Today, you'll learn
how to design


10
00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.423 line:-1 position:50%
for a spatial operating system.


11
00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.059 line:-1 position:50%
Here, the world around you
is an infinite canvas


12
00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:29.363 line:-1 position:50%
for amazing new apps and games.


13
00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:32.599 line:-1 position:50%
Nathan: With depth, scale,
natural inputs,


14
00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.302 line:-1 position:50%
and Spatial Audio,
you can create experiences


15
00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:38.438 line:-1 position:50%
that were
never possible before.


16
00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:43.076 line:-1 position:50%
You can enhance an existing
app with key moments,


17
00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:47.381 line:-1 position:50%
or create something
entirely new.


18
00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:50.484 line:-1 position:50%
You can go to a new place


19
00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:54.688 line:-1 position:50%
or share an experience
with someone special.


20
00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:55.856 line:-1 position:50%
Amy: There's a lot to learn,


21
00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.691 line:-1 position:50%
and we're here to help you
get started.


22
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:00.027 line:-1 position:50%
Nathan: We'll help you
make your ideas a reality


23
00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:02.496 line:-1 position:50%
and create experiences
people will love.


24
00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:06.233 line:-1 position:50%
Today, we'll talk about
how to make great spatial apps.


25
00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:07.701 line:-1 position:50%
We'll start with the basics,


26
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.870 line:-1 position:50%
learning how to keep
your apps familiar.


27
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.240 line:-1 position:50%
Next, we'll talk about what
it means to be human-centered.


28
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.409 line:-1 position:50%
Then we'll learn how to use
dimension to take advantage


29
00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.846 line:-1 position:50%
of the space and push apps
even further with immersion.


30
00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.449 line:-1 position:50%
Last, we'll learn how to make
apps that feel authentic


31
00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.284 line:-1 position:50%
to the platform.


32
00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:25.686 line:-1 position:50%
Let's jump right in.


33
00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.554 line:-1 position:50%
With so many new possibilities,


34
00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.824 line:-1 position:50%
strike a balance
with what's familiar.


35
00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:36.630 line:-1 position:50%
Common elements like sidebars,
tabs, and search fields


36
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.467 line:-1 position:50%
help people find the music
they're looking for.


37
00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.002 line:-1 position:50%
On a spatial platform,


38
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.638 line:-1 position:50%
people should be able to find
their music just as reliably,


39
00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:47.908 line:-1 position:50%
using elements they recognize
and know how to use.


40
00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:50.077 line:-1 position:50%
We place interfaces
within windows


41
00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:53.213 line:-1 position:50%
so people can comfortably
see them and use them.


42
00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:55.482 line:-1 position:50%
People are familiar
with app windows,


43
00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.884 line:-1 position:50%
but on this platform,
windows live in your space


44
00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:00.554 line:-1 position:50%
and feel like part
of your surroundings.


45
00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:03.323 line:-1 position:50%
In this first section,
we'll talk about windows,


46
00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.759 line:-1 position:50%
learn how to find
the right size for them,


47
00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.495 line:-1 position:50%
and discuss the points system.


48
00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.697 line:-1 position:50%
Let's start with windows.


49
00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:13.900 line:-1 position:50%
We've designed windows
with a new visual language.


50
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.837 line:-1 position:50%
The glass material provides
contrast with the world,


51
00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:19.339 line:-1 position:50%
gives people more awareness
of their surroundings,


52
00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.210 line:-1 position:50%
and adapts to different
lighting conditions.


53
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:30.183 line:-1 position:50%
The system provides controls to
move, close, and resize windows.


54
00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.952 line:-1 position:50%
People can grab the window bar


55
00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:34.121 line:-1 position:50%
to move windows anywhere
around them.


56
00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:37.190 line:-1 position:50%
Notice how they always turn
to face someone when moving.


57
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.794 line:-1 position:50%
This keeps interfaces
easy to read and easy to use.


58
00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:45.165 line:-1 position:50%
When they release, the window
stays in its final position.


59
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:49.102 line:-1 position:50%
Next, let's talk about how to
choose a size for your windows.


60
00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:52.472 line:-1 position:50%
Windows are designed to fit
comfortably within people's view


61
00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:57.077 line:-1 position:50%
but they are super flexible,
stretching to fit any size.


62
00:02:57.077 --> 00:03:01.048 line:-1 position:50%
Choose a comfortable window size
based on your content.


63
00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:02.983 line:-1 position:50%
For example, Safari is tall


64
00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:05.218 line:-1 position:50%
so people can see
more of the web page,


65
00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:10.090 line:-1 position:50%
and Keynote is wide
to fit full-size presentations.


66
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.492 line:-1 position:50%
Windows can have
flexible shapes too.


67
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:16,630 position:50%
Use tab bars and toolbars
to push outside the window,


68
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,298 position:50%
like here in the Music app.


69
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,667 position:50%
These controls are layered
above the main window,


70
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,902 position:50%
so they're always accessible


71
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,971 position:50%
and provide more room
for the content.


72
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:28.442 line:-1 position:50%
Or use multiple sections to
separate controls from content.


73
00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:30.944 line:-1 position:50%
Here in Safari,
the navigation bar is set apart


74
00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:34.648 line:-1 position:50%
from the web page
to let the page take the focus.


75
00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:37.284 line:-1 position:50%
And windows can change size too.


76
00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:39.252 line:-1 position:50%
When the sidebar
is opened in Safari,


77
00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.688 line:-1 position:50%
the window grows,
showing more controls


78
00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.890 line:-1 position:50%
without covering the web page.


79
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.725 line:-1 position:50%
Windows aren't
bound by a screen,


80
00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.794 line:-1 position:50%
so they should remain
smaller when possible


81
00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:50.831 line:-1 position:50%
to avoid blocking
too much of people's view.


82
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:53.700 line:-1 position:50%
Think about how your app
can be flexible and dynamic,


83
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.304 line:-1 position:50%
changing its shape and size
based on the context.


84
00:03:57.304 --> 00:04:00.140 line:-1 position:50%
Designing apps for this platform
is a ton of fun.


85
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.508 line:-1 position:50%
If you need a larger canvas,


86
00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:04.044 line:-1 position:50%
you can give yourself
a larger canvas.


87
00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:06.980 line:-1 position:50%
And like other platforms,
apps can have multiple windows,


88
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.516 line:-1 position:50%
which are useful
in certain cases.


89
00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:11.651 line:-1 position:50%
They can display content
side by side,


90
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.421 line:-1 position:50%
like viewing multiple
web pages at once,


91
00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.557 line:-1 position:50%
or show distinct actions
meant to be used together.


92
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,060 position:50%
Here in Keynote,
when playing a presentation,


93
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,796 position:50%
the slides are in one window,
large and far away,


94
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:26,166 position:50%
while the presenter display
is in a smaller window nearby.


95
00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.101 line:-1 position:50%
This lets people place
the presenter display


96
00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.905 line:-1 position:50%
where they want while keeping
the slides nice and large.


97
00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:35.408 line:-1 position:50%
Ideally, keep your app's
interface in a single window.


98
00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.444 line:-1 position:50%
Multiple windows
can quickly become a lot


99
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.446 line:-1 position:50%
for people to manage.


100
00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.781 line:-1 position:50%
Next, let's talk about points.


101
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.117 line:-1 position:50%
To make sure our
interfaces scale well,


102
00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.353 line:-1 position:50%
we design with points.


103
00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:49.022 line:-1 position:50%
This is a concept you're
probably already familiar with.


104
00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:50.657 line:-1 position:50%
Points are the way
we specify the size


105
00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:53.860 line:-1 position:50%
of interface elements,
describing our interfaces


106
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.730 line:-1 position:50%
in a way that adapts
to other screens.


107
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.666 line:-1 position:50%
On this platform,
as people move windows,


108
00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.601 line:-1 position:50%
they scale larger
as they move away


109
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:04.137 line:-1 position:50%
and scale smaller
as they move closer to them.


110
00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:07.641 line:-1 position:50%
This keeps interfaces
legible and usable.


111
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,177 position:50%
And if you're used to points
on other platforms,


112
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,845 position:50%
they're a familiar way
to set the size


113
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,547 position:50%
of interface elements
like buttons


114
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:16,216 position:50%
with the same units
you already know.


115
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,018 position:50%
Design your interface
with points


116
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,520 position:50%
and it will work
at any distance.


117
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.089 line:-1 position:50%
Learn more about designing
interfaces in the session


118
00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.692 line:-1 position:50%
"Design Spatial
User Interfaces".


119
00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:28.061 line:-1 position:50%
Next, let's talk about
how we can design apps


120
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.230 line:-1 position:50%
that are human-centered.


121
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.099 line:-1 position:50%
Good design is always
human-centered,


122
00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.869 line:-1 position:50%
but now this takes on
a whole new meaning.


123
00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:37.103 line:-1 position:50%
People wear the device,


124
00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:39.039 line:-1 position:50%
use their eyes and hands
to interact,


125
00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.374 line:-1 position:50%
and experience apps
through their own view


126
00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.276 line:-1 position:50%
in their own space.


127
00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:46.980 line:-1 position:50%
When designing spatial apps,
think about what someone can see


128
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.482 line:-1 position:50%
and how they might need to move.


129
00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:52.319 line:-1 position:50%
Let's start with
what people can see.


130
00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.820 line:-1 position:50%
When people wear the device,


131
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.722 line:-1 position:50%
they see the world
in front of them.


132
00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:57.691 line:-1 position:50%
This is their field of view.


133
00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.759 line:-1 position:50%
It's easiest to see things
in the center,


134
00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.262 line:-1 position:50%
so place the most
important content there.


135
00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:06.099 line:-1 position:50%
And the field of view is wide,
so use landscape layouts.


136
00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.667 line:-1 position:50%
Here's an example.


137
00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:10.804 line:-1 position:50%
In Safari, when people want
to see all their tabs at once,


138
00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:12.739 line:-1 position:50%
we spread them out in a grid.


139
00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:15.875 line:-1 position:50%
This layout is wide to match
people's field of view.


140
00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:19.145 line:-1 position:50%
The tabs scale down so they're
not too far from the center,


141
00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:21.014 line:-1 position:50%
and the tabs on the sides
turn inward


142
00:06:21.014 --> 00:06:23.516 line:-1 position:50%
so they're easier to read.


143
00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.418 line:-1 position:50%
But people don't keep
their head perfectly still,


144
00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:26.620 line:-1 position:50%
they look around.


145
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.688 line:-1 position:50%
This means we can
extend content further


146
00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:30.991 line:-1 position:50%
for immersive experiences,
but in general,


147
00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:33.426 line:-1 position:50%
keep your main content
within the field of view,


148
00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:36.896 line:-1 position:50%
or else it's difficult to read
or comprehend all at once.


149
00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.565 line:-1 position:50%
Designing with
people at the center


150
00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:41.301 line:-1 position:50%
also means to design
with ergonomics in mind.


151
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:43.637 line:-1 position:50%
The placement of your content
has a big effect


152
00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:45.805 line:-1 position:50%
on how people react physically.


153
00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:49.109 line:-1 position:50%
So place objects comfortably
in all dimensions.


154
00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:52.846 line:-1 position:50%
By default, windows are placed
along a natural line of sight


155
00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:55.582 line:-1 position:50%
to encourage a healthy
and comfortable posture.


156
00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.083 line:-1 position:50%
When placing your own content,


157
00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.152 line:-1 position:50%
place it relative
to the person's head


158
00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.755 line:-1 position:50%
in the direction they're facing.


159
00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:04.524 line:-1 position:50%
This helps people see
and interact with your content


160
00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:06.559 line:-1 position:50%
and accounts for people
of different heights


161
00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:10.130 line:-1 position:50%
and in different positions,
like laying back on a couch.


162
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.133 line:-1 position:50%
Most of the time,
place content away from people,


163
00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:15.635 line:-1 position:50%
a bit further than arm's reach,
to encourage people


164
00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:17.737 line:-1 position:50%
to interact at a distance.


165
00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:21.541 line:-1 position:50%
Avoid placing content behind
people or extremely high or low


166
00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:24.377 line:-1 position:50%
unless it's part of
an immersive experience.


167
00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.313 line:-1 position:50%
Not everyone
will be seated in a way


168
00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:29.649 line:-1 position:50%
where they can move around
to use your app.


169
00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:32.385 line:-1 position:50%
And avoid anchoring content
to people's view.


170
00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:35.588 line:-1 position:50%
This makes things feel stuck
and can be disorienting.


171
00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:38.625 line:-1 position:50%
Instead, anchor content
in people's space.


172
00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.629 line:-1 position:50%
This gives them the freedom
to look around naturally.


173
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:46.700 line:-1 position:50%
While wearing the device, people
can also get up and walk around.


174
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.436 line:-1 position:50%
But we recommend creating
stationary experiences


175
00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:51.604 line:-1 position:50%
that require minimal movement.


176
00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:54.841 line:-1 position:50%
This makes your apps
easier to use for everyone.


177
00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:56.743 line:-1 position:50%
Unless it's a core part
of your experience,


178
00:07:56.743 --> 00:07:58.244 line:-1 position:50%
people should be able
to use your app


179
00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.046 line:-1 position:50%
without needing to move at all.


180
00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.615 line:-1 position:50%
Sometimes people do move
to a new seat in their room


181
00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.684 line:-1 position:50%
or to face
a different direction.


182
00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:07.520 line:-1 position:50%
When they settle, they can
press and hold the Digital Crown


183
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.055 line:-1 position:50%
to recenter.


184
00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.558 line:-1 position:50%
This moves content
back in front of them.


185
00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:13.827 line:-1 position:50%
Your app doesn't need
to provide a special way


186
00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.529 line:-1 position:50%
to bring back windows
or reset the scene.


187
00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:19.632 line:-1 position:50%
Instead, rely on this system
as a way to reposition


188
00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:21.868 line:-1 position:50%
your app's content.


189
00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:25.572 line:-1 position:50%
Next, let's talk about
giving your app dimension.


190
00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:28.475 line:-1 position:50%
We'll discuss the space
that's available for your app,


191
00:08:28.475 --> 00:08:32.412 line:-1 position:50%
and after that,
how to use depth and scale.


192
00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:34.514 line:-1 position:50%
Let's start with space.


193
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:38.051 line:-1 position:50%
Great apps take advantage
of the space around people.


194
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:39.853 line:-1 position:50%
And while the canvas
is infinite,


195
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.122 line:-1 position:50%
people's physical space
may be limited.


196
00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:45.091 line:-1 position:50%
Design your app to work well
in any amount of space,


197
00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:47.360 line:-1 position:50%
because you don't know where
someone might be using it.


198
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.396 line:-1 position:50%
Also be careful not
to constrain your app


199
00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:51.698 line:-1 position:50%
by the physical space available.


200
00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.401 line:-1 position:50%
Let's see how this works
with the TV app.


201
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:57.904 line:-1 position:50%
Here, a window is moved
through a chair in the room.


202
00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:00.540 line:-1 position:50%
The chair is still visible
while the window is moving


203
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.409 line:-1 position:50%
to make it easy to place.


204
00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:05.311 line:-1 position:50%
When the window is released,
the content becomes visible


205
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.847 line:-1 position:50%
so people can see
and use the app.


206
00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:09.582 line:-1 position:50%
With windows,
you don't need to worry


207
00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:11.651 line:-1 position:50%
about how they fit
into someone's space


208
00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.187 line:-1 position:50%
since the system
handles this for you.


209
00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:15.789 line:-1 position:50%
When it's time to watch a movie,


210
00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:17.891 line:-1 position:50%
the video takes over
the entire window


211
00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.659 line:-1 position:50%
and passthrough is darkened.


212
00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:23.563 line:-1 position:50%
Dimming is a simple yet
powerful way to maximize space.


213
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.232 line:-1 position:50%
Even though the movie might
overlap the physical room,


214
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.068 line:-1 position:50%
dimming helps people
focus on the content.


215
00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.804 line:-1 position:50%
This is a great balance.


216
00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:32.772 line:-1 position:50%
People are still aware
of their surroundings


217
00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:35.108 line:-1 position:50%
without being limited by them.


218
00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:38.144 line:-1 position:50%
And at any time,
people might open an Environment


219
00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:42.515 line:-1 position:50%
extending beyond the dimensions
of their physical room.


220
00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:45.652 line:-1 position:50%
And if your app needs
more space to fit big content,


221
00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:48.988 line:-1 position:50%
you can create your own
larger-than-life experience.


222
00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:51.124 line:-1 position:50%
Here, we created
an immersive cinema


223
00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:53.226 line:-1 position:50%
to fit a huge movie theater.


224
00:09:53.226 --> 00:09:57.864 line:-1 position:50%
We'll talk more later about Full
Space experiences like these.


225
00:09:57.864 --> 00:10:00.867 line:-1 position:50%
Giving apps dimension
means using depth.


226
00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:04.404 line:-1 position:50%
On this spatial platform,
depth is a new variable.


227
00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:07.640 line:-1 position:50%
It's a powerful tool
for hierarchy and focus.


228
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.676 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at some examples.


229
00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:12.912 line:-1 position:50%
Depth affects how we relate
to objects in space.


230
00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:15.315 line:-1 position:50%
Content far away
can be nice and large


231
00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:18.051 line:-1 position:50%
and encourages people
to interact at a distance.


232
00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:20.487 line:-1 position:50%
Nearby objects
invite interaction


233
00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:23.189 line:-1 position:50%
and are easier to inspect
at different angles.


234
00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:27.794 line:-1 position:50%
A small movement allows us to
see the object from all sides.


235
00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:31.130 line:-1 position:50%
A great use of depth
is to create hierarchy.


236
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.533 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take another look
at the TV app.


237
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,801 position:50%
In the immersive cinema,


238
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,104 position:50%
the playback controls
are placed small and nearby.


239
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,239 position:50%
Even though they're small,


240
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,774 position:50%
it's still clear that
they control the movie.


241
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,710 position:50%
If they were placed
on the movie screen,


242
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,145 position:50%
they would look too large
and out of place.


243
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,781 position:50%
Nearby elements like these
can remain small


244
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:54,187 position:50%
but still take visual precedence
over large objects far away.


245
00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:56.756 line:-1 position:50%
Depth needs to be reinforced
with visual cues


246
00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:58.992 line:-1 position:50%
like light and shadow.


247
00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:02.662 line:-1 position:50%
Some objects emit light, like
the movie screen we just saw.


248
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.797 line:-1 position:50%
The light shines
onto the floor and ceiling,


249
00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:07.333 line:-1 position:50%
highlighting its position
in the room.


250
00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.536 line:-1 position:50%
Any object that appears
to emit light


251
00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:13.039 line:-1 position:50%
should shine color
onto nearby objects.


252
00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:15.642 line:-1 position:50%
And most other objects
should cast a shadow,


253
00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:17.510 line:-1 position:50%
like this window over the table.


254
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.078 line:-1 position:50%
This grounds them
and makes them look


255
00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:21.247 line:-1 position:50%
more integrated into the space.


256
00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:26.185 line:-1 position:50%
Any custom objects in your app
should cast shadows too.


257
00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.922 line:-1 position:50%
In most cases,
prefer subtle depth.


258
00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:30.323 line:-1 position:50%
It's easy to overdo,


259
00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:33.826 line:-1 position:50%
making things look
distracting or unrealistic.


260
00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:36.229 line:-1 position:50%
Subtle depth between
elements is often enough


261
00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:38.831 line:-1 position:50%
to direct people's attention.


262
00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:40.533 line:-1 position:50%
Notice how when
a modal appears,


263
00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:43.703 line:-1 position:50%
the window pushes back slightly
to bring attention to it.


264
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:47.240 line:-1 position:50%
The depth is subtle,
but effective.


265
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.008 line:-1 position:50%
And not everything needs depth.


266
00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:50.310 line:-1 position:50%
Text, for example,


267
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.079 line:-1 position:50%
can be distracting and difficult
to read when it's 3D,


268
00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.881 line:-1 position:50%
especially at an angle.


269
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:59.485 line:-1 position:50%
Keep text flat when used
as an interface element.


270
00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:03.823 line:-1 position:50%
Like depth, scale is a new way
to emphasize your content.


271
00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:07.393 line:-1 position:50%
Small objects feel personal
and lightweight.


272
00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.195 line:-1 position:50%
Large objects feel impressive,


273
00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:11.431 line:-1 position:50%
like a giant movie
playing over a lake.


274
00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:13.399 line:-1 position:50%
Increasing the scale
completely changes


275
00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.436 line:-1 position:50%
the feeling of the movie.


276
00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:19.572 line:-1 position:50%
Some objects are best viewed
at their real-life scale.


277
00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:22.275 line:-1 position:50%
For example, a shopping app
may want to display products


278
00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:24.711 line:-1 position:50%
as they appear in real life.


279
00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:27.113 line:-1 position:50%
Explore different scales
for your content.


280
00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:30.149 line:-1 position:50%
Try making things really big
or try them really small,


281
00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:32.051 line:-1 position:50%
and see how scale makes it feel.


282
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:35.788 line:-1 position:50%
To push your app even further,
it's time to leverage immersion.


283
00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:37.790 line:-1 position:50%
To tell you more, here's Amy.


284
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.392 line:-1 position:50%
Amy: Thanks, Nathan.


285
00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:43.196 line:-1 position:50%
Now let's talk about
how to make your app immersive.


286
00:12:43.196 --> 00:12:45.898 line:-1 position:50%
Immersive experiences
extend beyond a window


287
00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:48.301 line:-1 position:50%
and transform
the world around you.


288
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:50.737 line:-1 position:50%
We'll explore
the immersion spectrum,


289
00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:54.374 line:-1 position:50%
essential tips for creating
great immersive apps,


290
00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:57.276 line:-1 position:50%
and how to keep people
comfortable.


291
00:12:57.276 --> 00:13:00.113 line:-1 position:50%
First, the immersion spectrum.


292
00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:03.082 line:-1 position:50%
On this platform,
an app can be dynamic.


293
00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:04.517 line:-1 position:50%
It can fluidly transition


294
00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:06.486 line:-1 position:50%
between different
states of immersion,


295
00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:09.422 line:-1 position:50%
depending on where people
are in your experience.


296
00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:11.958 line:-1 position:50%
This spectrum offers
so much flexibility.


297
00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.494 line:-1 position:50%
You can enhance someone's view
or bring them to a new place


298
00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.729 line:-1 position:50%
and everything in between.


299
00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:19.832 line:-1 position:50%
Your app can be within
a window in the Shared Space


300
00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:21.868 line:-1 position:50%
alongside other apps.


301
00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:25.004 line:-1 position:50%
Or if it needs more room,
it could run in a Full Space,


302
00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:27.273 line:-1 position:50%
where other apps are hidden.


303
00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:30.343 line:-1 position:50%
Try to start your app in
a window in the Shared Space.


304
00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:31.678 line:-1 position:50%
This will give people control


305
00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:33.846 line:-1 position:50%
over how immersed
they want to be.


306
00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:35.548 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at an example.


307
00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:38.317 line:-1 position:50%
In Keynote,
the app opens in a window.


308
00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.119 line:-1 position:50%
But when it's time
to play the slideshow,


309
00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:43.423 line:-1 position:50%
we use dimming to bring focus
to this presentation.


310
00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:45.625 line:-1 position:50%
Dimming is a simple way
to create contrast


311
00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:48.261 line:-1 position:50%
between your content
and people's surroundings


312
00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:51.564 line:-1 position:50%
without taking them
out of their space.


313
00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:53.833 line:-1 position:50%
When it's time to rehearse
the presentation,


314
00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.436 line:-1 position:50%
we can bring people
onto the big stage


315
00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:59.138 line:-1 position:50%
fully immersing them
within the theater.


316
00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:02.642 line:-1 position:50%
Life-size experiences like these
require more room,


317
00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:06.846 line:-1 position:50%
so Keynote is now in a Full
Space and other apps are hidden.


318
00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.315 line:-1 position:50%
Here the app takes someone
to a new place


319
00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:12.719 line:-1 position:50%
that they can see
all around them.


320
00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:16.055 line:-1 position:50%
But Full Space moments might
not take someone to a new place.


321
00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:19.125 line:-1 position:50%
They can exist within
their own space as well.


322
00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:21.427 line:-1 position:50%
Here it feels like you're
looking out over the ocean


323
00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:24.097 line:-1 position:50%
while you still see
your surrounding room.


324
00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:26.699 line:-1 position:50%
You can design rich,
immersive experiences


325
00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:29.402 line:-1 position:50%
without taking over
someone's entire view.


326
00:14:29.402 --> 00:14:31.604 line:-1 position:50%
This is also helpful
if they need to see their hands


327
00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:35.141 line:-1 position:50%
to use a keyboard or controller.


328
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:37.009 line:-1 position:50%
Immersive apps
can also feel connected


329
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:39.378 line:-1 position:50%
to people's
physical surroundings.


330
00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:43.216 line:-1 position:50%
Here, a big welcome moment
casts a shadow across the table,


331
00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.786 line:-1 position:50%
making "hello" feel like
it's really there.


332
00:14:46.786 --> 00:14:49.689 line:-1 position:50%
If your experience relates to
someone's physical surroundings,


333
00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:52.158 line:-1 position:50%
remember to keep
your design flexible.


334
00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:53.726 line:-1 position:50%
Not everyone's space
is the same,


335
00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.762 line:-1 position:50%
and spaces tend to change
over time,


336
00:14:55.762 --> 00:15:00.533 line:-1 position:50%
so make sure your experience
can adapt to work well anywhere.


337
00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:05.671 line:-1 position:50%
Now, some essential tips for
creating great immersive apps.


338
00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.473 line:-1 position:50%
When designing
immersive experiences,


339
00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:09.308 line:-1 position:50%
there's a new consideration.


340
00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:12.478 line:-1 position:50%
People can look around and pay
attention to different things,


341
00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:14.514 line:-1 position:50%
but if too much is happening
all at once,


342
00:15:14.514 --> 00:15:18.317 line:-1 position:50%
they might feel overwhelmed
or unsure of what to do.


343
00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:21.454 line:-1 position:50%
Which is why it's important
to guide people's focus


344
00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:25.324 line:-1 position:50%
toward parts of your experience
that matter the most.


345
00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.492 line:-1 position:50%
In the Mindfulness app,


346
00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:31.030 line:-1 position:50%
your focus is guided toward
a single object in space.


347
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.232 line:-1 position:50%
While you could look
in any direction,


348
00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:36.669 line:-1 position:50%
your attention is drawn here,
through motion,


349
00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:41.707 line:-1 position:50%
spatialized audio,
and colorful materials.


350
00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:43.843 line:-1 position:50%
When it's time
for deeper reflection,


351
00:15:43.843 --> 00:15:48.281 line:-1 position:50%
we gently expand the flower
to fully surround you.


352
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.149 line:-1 position:50%
Remember to design smooth,


353
00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:52.018 line:-1 position:50%
predictable transitions
like these


354
00:15:52.018 --> 00:15:54.053 line:-1 position:50%
to create continuity
between different states


355
00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:56.289 line:-1 position:50%
of your experience.


356
00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:58.024 line:-1 position:50%
This will keep people
feeling comfortable


357
00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:01.327 line:-1 position:50%
and aware of what's happening.


358
00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:05.765 line:-1 position:50%
Another important tip is to
blend thoughtfully with reality.


359
00:16:05.765 --> 00:16:09.001 line:-1 position:50%
If your app's in a Full Space,
you can use the shape of a room


360
00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:12.805 line:-1 position:50%
to anchor content or create
physical interactions.


361
00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.407 line:-1 position:50%
An awareness
of someone's surroundings


362
00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:18.845 line:-1 position:50%
allows you to blend your content
meaningfully within it.


363
00:16:18.845 --> 00:16:21.647 line:-1 position:50%
When you're blending entire
scenes into someone's space,


364
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:26.152 line:-1 position:50%
make sure to use soft edges
to smoothly integrate your app.


365
00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:27.854 line:-1 position:50%
This avoids abrupt transitions


366
00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:31.057 line:-1 position:50%
and keeps people focused
on your content.


367
00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:36.495 line:-1 position:50%
The most inspiring experiences
make things feel alive.


368
00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:39.866 line:-1 position:50%
Subtle animation can bring
liveliness to a scene,


369
00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:43.069 line:-1 position:50%
like water rippling on a lake


370
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:46.072 line:-1 position:50%
or clouds floating
through the sky.


371
00:16:46.072 --> 00:16:48.808 line:-1 position:50%
Subtle motion can transform
a static experience


372
00:16:48.808 --> 00:16:52.311 line:-1 position:50%
into something alive
and dynamic.


373
00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:54.146 line:-1 position:50%
And to enhance things
even further,


374
00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:57.416 line:-1 position:50%
create atmosphere with sound.


375
00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:58.818 line:-1 position:50%
With Spatial Audio,


376
00:16:58.818 --> 00:17:01.587 line:-1 position:50%
you can anchor sound
to objects in space...

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.908 line:-1 position:50%
One last tip: do more with less.


383
00:17:21.908 --> 00:17:25.211 line:-1 position:50%
You can create big impact
with small effects.


384
00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.747 line:-1 position:50%
In the cinema, a subtle light
reflecting on the floor


385
00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:30.516 line:-1 position:50%
and ceiling gives a convincing
sense of space.


386
00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:33.085 line:-1 position:50%
You don't need to render all
the details of a real theater


387
00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:35.922 line:-1 position:50%
to convey the feeling
of being in one.


388
00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:38.724 line:-1 position:50%
Last, let's talk about keeping
people comfortable


389
00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.593 line:-1 position:50%
and in control.


390
00:17:40.593 --> 00:17:42.161 line:-1 position:50%
If you need to move
your immersive app


391
00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:43.896 line:-1 position:50%
or someone's position within it,


392
00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:46.599 line:-1 position:50%
make sure to avoid large,
fast movement.


393
00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:48.968 line:-1 position:50%
This could feel disorienting.


394
00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:52.471 line:-1 position:50%
Instead, we recommend fading
out content while it's in motion


395
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.941 line:-1 position:50%
and fading it back in
once it's settled.


396
00:17:54.941 --> 00:17:58.077 line:-1 position:50%
This will keep people
feeling steady.


397
00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.112 line:-1 position:50%
If people physically move
in their space,


398
00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:03.015 line:-1 position:50%
immersive experiences
will also fade out.


399
00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:05.051 line:-1 position:50%
This shows people
their physical surroundings


400
00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:07.053 line:-1 position:50%
while they're in motion.


401
00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:12.992 line:-1 position:50%
And make sure
to provide a clear way


402
00:18:12.992 --> 00:18:16.028 line:-1 position:50%
in and out of
your immersive experience.


403
00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:18.631 line:-1 position:50%
Guide people with short,
helpful labels


404
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:24.103 line:-1 position:50%
and recognizable symbols,
like expand and collapse arrows.


405
00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.771 line:-1 position:50%
Our last principle.


406
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.606 line:-1 position:50%
Let's talk about
how to make your app


407
00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:30.576 line:-1 position:50%
authentic to the platform.


408
00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:32.578 line:-1 position:50%
When creating
any great app experience,


409
00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:33.946 line:-1 position:50%
it's important to take advantage


410
00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.582 line:-1 position:50%
of the unique capabilities
of the device.


411
00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:40.586 line:-1 position:50%
On this platform, the best apps
are rich, immersive experiences


412
00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:43.122 line:-1 position:50%
that make use of people's space.


413
00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:46.392 line:-1 position:50%
Apps shouldn't be quick things
you jump into for a minute.


414
00:18:46.392 --> 00:18:49.395 line:-1 position:50%
Freeform, for example,
puts you in a big creative space


415
00:18:49.395 --> 00:18:51.330 line:-1 position:50%
where you can see
all of your content at once


416
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.367 line:-1 position:50%
to focus on your project.


417
00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:58.371 line:-1 position:50%
Think about how you can make
your app worthwhile, engaging,


418
00:18:58.371 --> 00:19:01.440 line:-1 position:50%
and distinct enough that people
will welcome your experience


419
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.010 line:-1 position:50%
into their space.


420
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.545 line:-1 position:50%
Before we wrap up, let's
apply the things we covered


421
00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:08.147 line:-1 position:50%
to your own app.


422
00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.648 line:-1 position:50%
You might be starting
with a new idea


423
00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:12.585 line:-1 position:50%
or extending an existing one
to the platform.


424
00:19:12.585 --> 00:19:14.153 line:-1 position:50%
With so many possibilities,


425
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:17.656 line:-1 position:50%
start by focusing on one unique
aspect of your app or game


426
00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:20.860 line:-1 position:50%
that can be spatial
or immersive.


427
00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.962 line:-1 position:50%
To do that, find a key moment


428
00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:26.665 line:-1 position:50%
that can only
be experienced spatially.


429
00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:30.136 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at how we did this
in the Photos app.


430
00:19:30.136 --> 00:19:32.338 line:-1 position:50%
We looked at core features
of the Photos app


431
00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:35.841 line:-1 position:50%
people were already familiar
with on existing platforms.


432
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:39.979 line:-1 position:50%
Browsing your Photos library,
rediscovering special memories,


433
00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:43.816 line:-1 position:50%
and reliving a place
through panoramas.


434
00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:47.353 line:-1 position:50%
We thought finding your favorite
photos should be easy.


435
00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:49.922 line:-1 position:50%
A window interface
and familiar navigation


436
00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:53.159 line:-1 position:50%
help you get to what
you're looking for quickly.


437
00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:55.428 line:-1 position:50%
But when you find
that special shot,


438
00:19:55.428 --> 00:19:57.430 line:-1 position:50%
the photo grows big
in your space


439
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.965 line:-1 position:50%
and dims your surroundings.


440
00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:02.935 line:-1 position:50%
These are the same great
memories on your iPhone,


441
00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:07.339 line:-1 position:50%
but seeing them at a lifelike
scale is truly magical.


442
00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:09.642 line:-1 position:50%
And when it's time
to view a panorama,


443
00:20:09.642 --> 00:20:12.044 line:-1 position:50%
we have a key moment,
taking you back


444
00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:15.081 line:-1 position:50%
to a special place to feel like
you're really there.


445
00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:18.918 line:-1 position:50%
Here, panoramas transport you
in a way that's only possible


446
00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:21.987 line:-1 position:50%
with infinite space.
