great SharePlay experiences

8
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,924 line:0
In a SharePlay session,


9
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,127 line:0
Spatial Personas
let you feel present with others


10
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:31,064 position:50%
in a way technology
has never enabled before.


11
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,999 position:50%
You can look your friends
in the eye,


12
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:36,937 line:0
express yourself naturally with
movement and body language,


13
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:40,407 line:0
and best of all,
enjoy a shared activity together


14
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,643 position:50%
using your app.


15
00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:44.578 line:-1 position:50%
These shared activities
are a key part


16
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:48,115 line:-1
of what makes this an exciting
new computing platform


17
00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:51.184 line:-1 position:50%
and people will expect your app
to fully support


18
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:55,289 line:-1
the features I'm going
to talk about today.


19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,357 line:-1
Shared activities in FaceTime


20
00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:00.394 line:-1 position:50%
build on the existing foundation
of SharePlay,


21
00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:03.063 line:-1 position:50%
which is already a great way
for groups of people


22
00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.999 line:-1 position:50%
to enjoy content together
while apart.


23
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,368 line:-1
This includes simple UI patterns


24
00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:11.038 line:-1 position:50%
for understanding
what everyone is doing,


25
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:14,675 line:-1
shared control of the content,
and independent control


26
00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:20.113 line:-1 position:50%
for how the experience
appears on your own device.


27
00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.348 line:-1 position:50%
Shared context,


28
00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:25.519 line:-1 position:50%
available in SharePlay sessions
with Spatial Personas,


29
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,791 line:-1
allows for an even more
immersive SharePlay experience.


30
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,926 line:-1
Picture yourself sitting
in a living room


31
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,828 line:-1
in front of a TV with friends.


32
00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:38.465 line:-1 position:50%
If someone is to your right,
you are to their left.


33
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,901 line:-1
Everyone is free to move
around the room,


34
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,537 line:-1
and anyone can control the TV.


35
00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:46.606 line:-1 position:50%
It's always clear
who is controlling the TV


36
00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:50.177 line:-1 position:50%
because everyone is seeing
the same thing as everyone else.


37
00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:53.680 line:-1 position:50%
This is what we mean
by shared context.


38
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.617 line:-1 position:50%
Shared context also allows us
to communicate effortlessly.


39
00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.586 line:-1 position:50%
For example,
you can see Jay


40
00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:01.588 line:-1 position:50%
is not paying attention
to the movie.


41
00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:05.459 line:-1 position:50%
He's clearly distracted
by his phone.


42
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.927 line:-1 position:50%
He can point at things


43
00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:10.397 line:-1 position:50%
or use gestures
to better communicate.


44
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:14,668 line:0
He can communicate his emotions,
thoughts, and intentions,


45
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:18,005 line:0
using his facial expressions.


46
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,575 line:0
You can even tell
by his body language and actions


47
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:26,847 line:0
whether he's calm and relaxed
or stressed and anxious.


48
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:31,051 line:-1
Maintaining a shared context in
FaceTime with Spatial Personas


49
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:32.619 line:-1 position:50%
allows us to communicate


50
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:37,824 line:-1
more the way we have become
accustomed to in the real world.


51
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:41.161 line:-1 position:50%
In this presentation,
we're going to cover


52
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.898 line:-1 position:50%
how to set up the shared scene
for your activity,


53
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,167 line:-1
key considerations when starting


54
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,971 line:-1
SharePlay experiences
with Spatial Personas,


55
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,106 line:-1
how to pick
the seating arrangement


56
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,043 line:-1
that suits your shared activity,


57
00:02:56.043 --> 00:03:00.213 line:-1 position:50%
interactions in shared context
and the role of UI,


58
00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.649 line:-1 position:50%
and how to present
shared content


59
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:06,319 line:-1
when your app
is in a Full Space.


60
00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.756 line:-1 position:50%
Setting up a SharePlay activity
with Spatial Personas


61
00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:12.626 line:-1 position:50%
starts with understanding
the type of experience


62
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,795 line:-1
you are trying to recreate.


63
00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:18.098 line:-1 position:50%
Each type of experience
requires its own considerations


64
00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:22.903 line:-1 position:50%
for content placement
and interactivity.


65
00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:27.040 line:-1 position:50%
Enjoying media together
might look different from


66
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.509 line:-1 position:50%
collaborating
on a presentation together,


67
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.878 line:-1 position:50%
which might be different, again,


68
00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:37.117 line:-1 position:50%
from an engaging game that
deepens social connections.


69
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,286 line:-1
Your app can share
up to one window


70
00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:42.956 line:-1 position:50%
and one immersive space
at a time through SharePlay.


71
00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:44.758 line:-1 position:50%
Once you choose
the type of content


72
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,327 line:-1
your shared activity
will be built around,


73
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,597 line:-1
you need to think about
how to organize and present it


74
00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.166 line:-1 position:50%
in the most
socially desirable way.


75
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,468 line:-1
Consider the following


76
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:58,772 line:-1
when deciding what form
your experience will take.


77
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,808 line:-1
If you are presenting
your content in a window,


78
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:05,278 line:-1
you can think of your window
as being like a communal device


79
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:11,084 line:-1
or tool like a TV, a speaker,
a whiteboard, or a table.


80
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,620 line:-1
People can interact
with your windowed app


81
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.021 line:-1 position:50%
in their surroundings


82
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:20,026 line:-1
or even pull up environments
like the Moon.


83
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,363 line:-1
When creating SharePlay
activities in a Full Space,


84
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,366 line:-1
you can create
a more immersive experience,


85
00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:29.269 line:-1 position:50%
but people won't be able to
interact with their other apps


86
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.737 line:-1 position:50%
at the same time.


87
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,672 line:-1
You can think
of these experiences


88
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,407 line:-1
like a dedicated room --


89
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,043 line:-1
this degree of control and focus


90
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:43,483 line:-1
is useful for content like games
and media experiences.


91
00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:45.919 line:-1 position:50%
And keep in mind,
on this platform,


92
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,889 line:-1
people can easily have
many windows open.


93
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,326 line:-1
In SharePlay, every window
is marked clearly by the system


94
00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:57.297 line:-1 position:50%
with "shared" or "not shared."


95
00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.399 line:-1 position:50%
Putting your activity
in a window


96
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,069 line:-1
is a great way to support
multitasking and collaboration


97
00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:07.140 line:-1 position:50%
and doesn't require people
to leave their surroundings.


98
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.944 line:-1 position:50%
Using a windowed shared
activity enables workflows


99
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:15,415 line:-1
like dragging and dropping items
into your activity.


100
00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:19.219 line:-1 position:50%
You could even have more than
one window from your own app,


101
00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.722 line:-1 position:50%
enabling for example,
dragging and dropping songs


102
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:29,029 line:-1
from a private music library
to a public player window.


103
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.864 line:-1 position:50%
Next, let's talk about
how someone


104
00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:34.067 line:-1 position:50%
would join your shared activity.


105
00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:35.535 line:-1 position:50%
As on other platforms,


106
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:39,806 line:-1
you can include entry points
to SharePlay within your UI.


107
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,309 line:-1
For example,
in the TV app,


108
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:47,514 line:-1
any Play button can be used
to start a shared activity.


109
00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:51.885 line:-1 position:50%
The platform makes it easy to
start or stop a shared activity


110
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,221 line:-1
from the top of any window.


111
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:57,791 line:-1
People can share any window
with no additional effort


112
00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:01.394 line:-1 position:50%
from your app,
similar to macOS.


113
00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:05.899 line:-1 position:50%
But for richer, more volumetric
visuals or group interactivity,


114
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,569 line:-1
you will want
to adopt SharePlay.


115
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,672 line:-1
When possible,
don't launch any extra windows


116
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,442 line:-1
unrelated
to the shared activity.


117
00:06:15.442 --> 00:06:17.744 line:-1 position:50%
If your app requires an account,


118
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,514 line:-1
consider making shared
activities work without them.


119
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:25,752 line:-1
Minimize the amount of setup
involved in joining.


120
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:29,422 line:-1
If your shared activity
does need additional steps


121
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,958 line:-1
to get started,
start the activity


122
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,694 line:-1
for people who have
the right permissions


123
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,231 line:-1
and present a placeholder window
to those who don't.


124
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,434 line:-1
This signals what the rest
of the group is doing.


125
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,437 line:-1
The window should allow the
person to open anything needed


126
00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:47.374 line:-1 position:50%
to resolve any issues.


127
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,742 line:-1
As soon as the person has met


128
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,078 line:-1
the minimal requirements
to participate,


129
00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.180 line:-1 position:50%
close any extra windows


130
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,183 line:-1
and reveal the activity
to the participant,


131
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:02,789 line:-1
exactly where the placeholder
was the whole time.


132
00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.992 line:-1 position:50%
When someone begins
a shared activity in FaceTime,


133
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,195 line:-1
everyone already on the call
automatically joins,


134
00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:11.798 line:-1 position:50%
which adjusts where
everyone is seated


135
00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:16.436 line:-1 position:50%
and makes your app
visible for everyone.


136
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:20.607 line:-1 position:50%
Where your app is positioned,
where people sit around it,


137
00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:23.843 line:-1 position:50%
and where a new person shows up
when they join


138
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:27,480 line:-1
are all defined by one of three
seating arrangements


139
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,884 line:-1
that the platform offers
and your app can choose from.


140
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:35,455 line:-1
We call these
Spatial Persona Templates.


141
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,491 line:-1
For scenarios where
it's important for everyone


142
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,661 line:-1
to have a good view
of your app's content,


143
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.763 line:-1 position:50%
choose a side-by-side template


144
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,734 line:-1
where people sit
shoulder to shoulder.


145
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:51,504 line:-1
For an activity that resembles
a tabletop experience,


146
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,708 line:-1
choose the Surround template,
where your app's content


147
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,677 line:-1
is placed in the middle
of a circle of people.


148
00:07:57.677 --> 00:08:01.648 line:-1 position:50%
People can converse over your
app while looking at its content


149
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,185 line:-1
from their own unique
perspective.


150
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:08,355 line:-1
And for scenarios
where your app is ambient


151
00:08:08.355 --> 00:08:10.190 line:-1 position:50%
or doing something
in the background


152
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,059 line:-1
and conversation
is front and center,


153
00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:16.162 line:-1 position:50%
choose a Conversational
template.


154
00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:19.332 line:-1 position:50%
Not everyone gets a good angle
of your app's content,


155
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.701 line:-1 position:50%
so make sure
if you choose this,


156
00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:24.270 line:-1 position:50%
your activity doesn't
rely on everyone


157
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,474 line:-1
getting to interact with it.


158
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,043 line:-1
Your app can create
a SharePlay experience


159
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,480 line:-1
that supports up to four other
Spatial Personas.


160
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.050 line:-1 position:50%
Your app is responsible
for scaling what it presents


161
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.654 line:-1 position:50%
to any number of participants
ranging from two to five.


162
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,891 line:-1
For example, if you choose
a Surround template,


163
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:47.427 line:-1 position:50%
you should design your content
around the fact


164
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:52,432 line:-1
that there might be up to five
seats around the table.


165
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,335 line:-1
And of course,
life isn't just about work


166
00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:57.137 line:-1 position:50%
or content consumption.


167
00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:59.973 line:-1 position:50%
You can just hang out
in a relaxing place


168
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:04,310 line:-1
with friends and family
and enjoy quality time together.


169
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,047 line:-1
You should also choose
the surround template


170
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:12,385 line:-1
when there's nothing to present
in the middle of the group.


171
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,288 line:-1
Next, my colleague Jay
will take you through


172
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:19,225 line:-1
how your content and
user interface should adapt


173
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:23.229 line:-1 position:50%
when you bring people
into a SharePlay experience.


174
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,198 line:-1
Jay: Thanks, Carnaven.


175
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,833 line:-1
Conveniently for you,
the platform


176
00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:29.335 line:-1 position:50%
takes on the responsibility
of making your app,


177
00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:31.438 line:-1 position:50%
your participants,
and their spaces


178
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,074 line:-1
share a common coordinate system
and frame of reference


179
00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:37.243 line:-1 position:50%
that we call "shared context."


180
00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.511 line:-1 position:50%
This means
you don't need to manage


181
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,147 line:-1
the synchronization
of the size, position,


182
00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:44.384 line:-1 position:50%
and orientation of your scenes.


183
00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:45.652 line:-1 position:50%
While we maintain the illusion


184
00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:47.554 line:-1 position:50%
that everyone is looking
at the same app,


185
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,757 line:-1
your app is actually running
separately on multiple devices,


186
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.159 line:-1 position:50%
and each instance
could display audio,


187
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,562 line:-1
visuals, and UI differently.


188
00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:58.131 line:-1 position:50%
Your app manages
the interactions, feedback,


189
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,600 line:-1
and choice of content
displayed on each device


190
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.768 line:-1 position:50%
to make everyone feel like


191
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,804 line:-1
they're looking
at the same thing.


192
00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:07.807 line:-1 position:50%
Your app needs to synchronize
everyone's view of content,


193
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:11,478 line:-1
showing animations and any
state changes in lockstep.


194
00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:13.746 line:-1 position:50%
This is key to making
gestures like pointing


195
00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:16.816 line:-1 position:50%
make sense to everyone
on the call.


196
00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:18.718 line:-1 position:50%
It's possible that your
shared activity might work


197
00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:22.589 line:-1 position:50%
both as a window and as
a more immersive experience.


198
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,824 line:-1
You should encourage everyone
to be in the same mode


199
00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:28.394 line:-1 position:50%
by having everyone follow
the first person to transition.


200
00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:31.664 line:-1 position:50%
Spatial Audio
is a great tool for adding


201
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,300 line:-1
more shared spatial context
to your app.


202
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.369 line:-1 position:50%
When everyone
is in the same environment,


203
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,471 line:-1
everyone shares
the same audio context


204
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,607 line:-1
so the group can hear
the gentle lapping of a lake


205
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,775 line:-1
coming from the same direction.


206
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,512 line:-1
A shared music player window
will sound as if it's a speaker


207
00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:47.814 line:-1 position:50%
positioned in the space
with you.


208
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,451 line:-1
In your app, you, too, can make
sound come from your app window


209
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,453 line:-1
or as part of a more
immersive soundstage


210
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,489 line:-1
that everyone
can navigate together.


211
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,224 line:-1
Once you've established
shared context,


212
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,860 line:-1
we can actually
get away with less UI.


213
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.062 line:-1 position:50%
If you're used to SharePlay
on iOS,


214
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,565 line:-1
you might be familiar
with how the system communicates


215
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,633 line:-1
when someone has done something


216
00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:09.102 line:-1 position:50%
that affects
everyone's experience.


217
00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:12.171 line:-1 position:50%
We do this to simulate
a sense of presence while apart


218
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,307 line:-1
and to understand
why something might have changed


219
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,509 line:-1
without your intervention.


220
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,945 line:-1
Remember that we can perceive
more of each other's actions


221
00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:21.181 line:-1 position:50%
naturally in FaceTime
on this platform,


222
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:23.550 line:-1 position:50%
especially when they involve
large physical motion,


223
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,985 line:-1
and we have the ability
to verbally resolve


224
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,322 line:-1
small moments of confusion.


225
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,624 line:-1
You can lean on in-person
communication


226
00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:34.527 line:-1 position:50%
to close any knowledge gaps,
so you don't need much UI,


227
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,032 line:-1
if any, to communicate
why something has changed.


228
00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.133 line:-1 position:50%
SharePlay activities


229
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,468 line:-1
feel most like their real-life
counterparts when people


230
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,371 line:-1
feel free to interact with
everything they see.


231
00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:48.441 line:-1 position:50%
Avoid the temptation to create
complicated permissions systems


232
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,043 line:-1
or turn-taking mechanisms


233
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,546 line:-1
if they aren't a natural
part of your experience.


234
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,516 line:-1
Consider instead being very
permissive with interactions,


235
00:11:56.516 --> 00:11:58.751 line:-1 position:50%
and impose a consistent
and predictable way


236
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,653 line:-1
to resolve conflicts.


237
00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:02.655 line:-1 position:50%
You can lean on the group
settling on norms


238
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,593 line:-1
that arise from bumping up
against these rules.


239
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,361 line:-1
While it's important to share
as much context


240
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,163 line:-1
across devices as possible,


241
00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:11.898 line:-1 position:50%
look for opportunities
for software


242
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,700 line:-1
to improve
on the physical limitations


243
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,902 line:-1
of real-world
social experiences,


244
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,939 line:-1
especially when it comes
to comfort and accessibility.


245
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,909 line:-1
For example, some people have
different volume preferences,


246
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,411 line:-1
or different abilities
to parse language.


247
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.947 line:-1 position:50%
So in TV, I can set
my own volume level


248
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,450 line:-1
without affecting
someone else's.


249
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,285 line:-1
And people who have trouble
hearing dialogue


250
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,087 line:-1
can still enjoy a show
at the same time


251
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,823 line:-1
as someone who'd rather not
see subtitles.


252
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,258 line:-1
Throughout these
personalizations,


253
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,227 line:-1
the same content will still be
played back at the same time,


254
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,930 line:-1
so no one is missing context.


255
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,133 line:-1
Collaborative work can take on
a different form on this device.


256
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,036 line:-1
By necessity, we're all used
to sitting at different devices


257
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:53,473 line:-1
even when we're working
on the same thing.


258
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,041 line:-1
We look at our own view
of content


259
00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:58.444 line:-1 position:50%
and edit one area of a document
while a coworker edits another,


260
00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:01.614 line:-1 position:50%
often leaving notes along
the way to call out changes.


261
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,052 line:-1
On this platform,


262
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,854 line:-1
collaboration experiences
can be more lively


263
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,590 line:-1
with a shared view
that everyone works on.


264
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,458 line:-1
This also allows you
to guide the group's attention


265
00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:15.295 line:-1 position:50%
with gestures.


266
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,030 line:-1
In real life,
we can use different tools


267
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.665 line:-1 position:50%
at the same time.


268
00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:20.466 line:-1 position:50%
So while people may be
looking at what feels like


269
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,002 line:-1
the same app window,
it's important to allow people


270
00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:26.739 line:-1 position:50%
to be in different
editing modes.


271
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,075 line:-1
This means the tool
each person has active


272
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,777 line:-1
should also be personalized,


273
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,512 line:-1
so just because
you're marking in red


274
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,248 line:-1
doesn't mean someone else
is stuck doing the same.


275
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,016 line:-1
As always,
keep the main viewport --


276
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:41,321 line:-1
the shared context --
the same for all participants.


277
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.289 line:-1 position:50%
If individuals want
to separately dive in


278
00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:44.824 line:-1 position:50%
on another part of the document,


279
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,292 line:-1
you could always
allow each person


280
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,994 line:-1
to open a personal window,


281
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,897 line:-1
as if they brought
their own iPad to the meeting.


282
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,965 line:-1
Opening multiple windows
can allow individuals


283
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,535 line:-1
to focus on their own edits
while still keeping


284
00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:59.739 line:-1 position:50%
the shared context
open for everyone else.


285
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,774 line:-1
Finally, we'll discuss
when it's appropriate


286
00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:04.177 line:-1 position:50%
for a participant
to leave a shared context


287
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:08,414 line:-1
and enter a Full Space
on their own.


288
00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:10.283 line:-1 position:50%
There's a ton of content
designed for this medium


289
00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:12.952 line:-1 position:50%
where there's only
one ideal viewing position.


290
00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:14.787 line:-1 position:50%
In these cases,
it may be appropriate


291
00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:18.691 line:-1 position:50%
to separate people
into different contexts.


292
00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.860 line:-1 position:50%
For example,
the magical spatial captures


293
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,830 line:-1
you can photograph in Head Set
can be shared as a window


294
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.166 line:-1 position:50%
side by side with everyone
else's Spatial Personas.


295
00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:29.068 line:-1 position:50%
But to get the full effect
of the capture,


296
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,337 line:-1
you can enter a Full Space.


297
00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:34.207 line:-1 position:50%
This Full Space view
is best seen head-on,


298
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,242 line:-1
so we don't allow
side-by-side viewing


299
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,978 line:-1
and hide other people's
Spatial Personas.


300
00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:40.947 line:-1 position:50%
Think of these moments
as if each person


301
00:14:40.947 --> 00:14:42.949 line:-1 position:50%
has temporarily
entered their own room.


302
00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:49.088 line:-1 position:50%
Similarly, panoramas,
180-, and 360-degree videos


303
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,524 line:-1
are designed to curve around
a single point of view,


304
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,093 line:-1
so Spatial Personas
should also not be visible


305
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,529 line:-1
when you enter this mode.


306
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,598 line:-1
You should make sure
context remains shared


307
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,600 line:-1
by continuing to synchronize
everyone's position


308
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.401 line:-1 position:50%
in the video.


309
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,470 line:-1
Another good reason
to leave a shared context


310
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,606 line:-1
is for individual safety.


311
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,741 line:-1
Someone may want to step out
of an immersive experience


312
00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.243 line:-1 position:50%
temporarily.


313
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,378 line:-1
People can always
press the Digital Crown


314
00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:14.981 line:-1 position:50%
to return to passthrough.


315
00:15:14.981 --> 00:15:17.250 line:-1 position:50%
When this happens,
find a way to continue


316
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,619 line:-1
representing the shared context
in a window

and make it easy
for the participant


318
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,857 line:-1
to rejoin shared context
once they're done.

When done right, even when
someone has to dip out,


320
00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:28.661 line:-1 position:50%
they should never feel lost


321
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:32,698 line:-1
about where the rest

In summary, design how your
activity begins for everyone.

While the system provides
a stable coordinate system


324
00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:41.707 line:-1 position:50%
for all participants,
your app is also responsible


325
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,911 line:-1
for sharing as much context
as possible.


326
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,980 line:-1
Depending on how complex
your app interactions are,


327
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,715 line:-1
personalized control
can be necessary


328
00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:52.485 line:-1 position:50%
for comfort and accessibility.


329
00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:54.453 line:-1 position:50%
In-person nonverbal cues


330
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,489 line:-1
can take the place
of state-change notifications


331
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,825 line:-1
in your UI.


332
00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:01.294 line:-1 position:50%
And designing a great
shared spatial experience


333
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:02.562 line:-1 position:50%
often comes down to knowing


334
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:07,133 line:-1
when and how to diverge
from shared context.


335
00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:08.734 line:-1 position:50%
Apps on this platform
really shine


336
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,536 line:-1
when they can be enjoyed
with others.


337
00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:11.804 line:-1 position:50%
We encourage you
to build your app


338
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,006 line:-1
with these social experiences
in mind.
