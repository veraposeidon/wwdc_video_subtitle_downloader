Israel Pastrana Vicente:
Hello and welcome


5
00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.680 line:-1 position:50%
to "Design for Spatial Input."


6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.350 line:-1 position:50%
My name is Israel,
and I'm here with Eugene.


7
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.186 line:-1 position:50%
We are designers
on the Apple Design team.


8
00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:20.320 line:-1 position:50%
Eugene Krivoruchko:
Today, we'll talk about


9
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.923 line:-1 position:50%
designing interactions
for eyes and hands.


10
00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:25.592 line:-1 position:50%
We'll cover what's special
about these new input methods,


11
00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:28.695 line:-1 position:50%
and how to make the best use
of them on our platform.


12
00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:29.830 line:-1 position:50%
Israel: Let's take a quick look


13
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.499 line:-1 position:50%
at all the available
input modalities.


14
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,402 position:50%
With spatial input,
you can simply look at a button


15
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,638 position:50%
and tap your fingers together
to select it,


16
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,007 position:50%
keeping your arm
relaxed on your lap.


17
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.743 line:-1 position:50%
Our system is designed
to interact with UI


18
00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:44.811 line:-1 position:50%
comfortably at a distance.


19
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:49.316 line:-1 position:50%
In some cases, you can also
interact with elements directly.


20
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:52,019 position:50%
For example,
typing on a virtual keyboard


21
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,721 position:50%
using your fingertips.


22
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:57.591 line:-1 position:50%
Holding your hands in the air
can cause fatigue,


23
00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:00.661 line:-1 position:50%
but we will see that some tasks
are better suited


24
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.163 line:-1 position:50%
to interact directly.


25
00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:06.433 line:-1 position:50%
Now, eyes and hands
are the new spatial inputs,


26
00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.836 line:-1 position:50%
but you can also use
other familiar inputs


27
00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:13.440 line:-1 position:50%
like voice to search
without needing to type.


28
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.976 line:-1 position:50%
Or keyboard and trackpad,
which are great


29
00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.878 line:-1 position:50%
for getting things done.


30
00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.714 line:-1 position:50%
Lastly, you can also
connect a game controller


31
00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:23.050 line:-1 position:50%
to play your favorite games.


32
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.818 line:-1 position:50%
We are going to focus
on the most new


33
00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:28.355 line:-1 position:50%
and exciting spatial inputs:
eyes and hands.


34
00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.324 line:-1 position:50%
Using your eyes and hands
to interact


35
00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:33.226 line:-1 position:50%
is distinct in a few ways.


36
00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:35.462 line:-1 position:50%
First, it's personal.


37
00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:39.099 line:-1 position:50%
Your eye movements and hand
gestures are unique to you.


38
00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.868 line:-1 position:50%
An array of cameras inside
and outside the device


39
00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:44.338 line:-1 position:50%
capture all the details
of your natural movements


40
00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:46.907 line:-1 position:50%
in a privacy-respectful way.


41
00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:49.009 line:-1 position:50%
Next, it's comfortable.


42
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.244 line:-1 position:50%
You can keep your hands
resting beside you


43
00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:55.148 line:-1 position:50%
because the device sees
a wide area around you.


44
00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:58.952 line:-1 position:50%
Lastly, it makes spatial
interactions precise.


45
00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.455 line:-1 position:50%
The device filters all the data
and translates it


46
00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:05.192 line:-1 position:50%
into accurate interactions
that you can use in your apps.


47
00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:08.629 line:-1 position:50%
So spatial input,
it's a personal input


48
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.632 line:-1 position:50%
that feels incredibly
comfortable while providing you


49
00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:14.468 line:-1 position:50%
great precision
to control your interactions.


50
00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:18.238 line:-1 position:50%
Today, we'll be going over
how to use your eyes and hands


51
00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:21.141 line:-1 position:50%
to interact naturally
with your apps.


52
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.477 line:-1 position:50%
Let's start with eyes.


53
00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.946 line:-1 position:50%
Eyes are the primary
targeting mechanism


54
00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:28.081 line:-1 position:50%
for spatial experiences.


55
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.618 line:-1 position:50%
All the interfaces in the system
react to where you look.


56
00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.488 line:-1 position:50%
And we can effortlessly target
any element


57
00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:38.792 line:-1 position:50%
just by looking at them,
no matter how far away they are.


58
00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:41.194 line:-1 position:50%
Now, I'll talk about
how to make apps


59
00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:43.530 line:-1 position:50%
that are comfortable
to interact with;


60
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.566 line:-1 position:50%
how to make them easy
to target with your eyes;


61
00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.703 line:-1 position:50%
how to make interfaces
that respond to where you look


62
00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:51.405 line:-1 position:50%
while respecting privacy;


63
00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:55.375 line:-1 position:50%
and finally, how eye intent
simplifies our layouts


64
00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.578 line:-1 position:50%
and offers unique
assistive options.


65
00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:01.481 line:-1 position:50%
In order to build apps that are
comfortable for the eyes,


66
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:06.153 line:-1 position:50%
we need to consider how your
content shows up in the device.


67
00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:08.488 line:-1 position:50%
Here's the first thing
to consider.


68
00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:11.525 line:-1 position:50%
Even though you have an infinite
canvas for your apps,


69
00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:15.762 line:-1 position:50%
you only see the content
inside the field of view.


70
00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.230 line:-1 position:50%
Within the field of view,


71
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.666 line:-1 position:50%
it's most comfortable
to look in the center,


72
00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:23.303 line:-1 position:50%
and it's less comfortable
to look at the edges.


73
00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:26.773 line:-1 position:50%
So, design apps that fit
inside the field of view,


74
00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:30.544 line:-1 position:50%
minimizing neck
and body movement.


75
00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.746 line:-1 position:50%
Try to keep the main content
of the app in the center


76
00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:37.751 line:-1 position:50%
of the field of view, the most
comfortable area for your eyes.


77
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.753 line:-1 position:50%
Looking at the edges
of the field of view


78
00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:42.589 line:-1 position:50%
can be tiring for your eyes,
so use these areas


79
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.492 line:-1 position:50%
for content that
you don't need all the time,


80
00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:49.830 line:-1 position:50%
like secondary actions,
which remain accessible


81
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.366 line:-1 position:50%
and don't interfere
with the main content.


82
00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:56.837 line:-1 position:50%
Always try to maximize eye
and neck comfort in your apps


83
00:03:56.837 --> 00:04:00.574 line:-1 position:50%
by placing the content
inside the field of view.


84
00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.709 line:-1 position:50%
Now, we should also
consider depth


85
00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.245 line:-1 position:50%
when thinking about eye comfort.


86
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.248 line:-1 position:50%
Depth is a unique feature
of spatial experiences.


87
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.650 line:-1 position:50%
Placing your content
near or far away


88
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.820 line:-1 position:50%
creates different feelings
in your projects.


89
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.023 line:-1 position:50%
But our eyes focus on
one distance at a time,


90
00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:19.259 line:-1 position:50%
and changing
the focus depth frequently


91
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.862 line:-1 position:50%
can create eye strain.


92
00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:24.731 line:-1 position:50%
Look to keep interactive content
at the same depth


93
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:28.535 line:-1 position:50%
to make it feel effortless
to switch between UI.


94
00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:31.304 line:-1 position:50%
For example,
presenting a modal view


95
00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:33.273 line:-1 position:50%
pushes the main view
in the z-axis,


96
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.810 line:-1 position:50%
and the modal is placed
at the original distance.


97
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.079 line:-1 position:50%
By maintaining
the same Z position,


98
00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:42.449 line:-1 position:50%
your eyes don't need
to adapt to the new distance.


99
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.152 line:-1 position:50%
Now, you can use
subtle changes in depth


100
00:04:45.152 --> 00:04:48.855 line:-1 position:50%
to communicate hierarchy,
like in this example,


101
00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.324 line:-1 position:50%
with a tab bar on the left
and a segmented control


102
00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.893 line:-1 position:50%
at the bottom.


103
00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:55.662 line:-1 position:50%
This way, you're using
depth meaningfully,


104
00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:58.431 line:-1 position:50%
while avoiding eye discomfort.


105
00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:01.134 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we've seen
how to make an app comfortable,


106
00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:04.871 line:-1 position:50%
we also need to make it
easy to use with your eyes.


107
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:08.074 line:-1 position:50%
Eyes are very precise,
but there are certain qualities


108
00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:12.078 line:-1 position:50%
that help our eyes target
successfully on UI elements.


109
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,448 position:50%
Our eyes naturally focus on
shapes that guide our attention


110
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,084 position:50%
to the middle of an object.


111
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,188 position:50%
To help our eyes,
use round shapes


112
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:26,059 position:50%
like circles, pills,
and rounded rectangles.


113
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:30,297 position:50%
Avoid using shapes
with sharp edges.


114
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:33,033 position:50%
When you use sharp edges,
your eyes tend to focus


115
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:37,704 position:50%
on the outside,
decreasing eye precision.


116
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:42,509 position:50%
Also, keep the shapes flat
and avoid thick outlines


117
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,846 position:50%
or effects that call attention
to the edges.


118
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,216 position:50%
And lastly, make sure to center
the text and the glyphs


119
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:53,253 position:50%
in your elements
using generous padding.


120
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:56,590 position:50%
So, always make sure
that your UI is designed


121
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,026 position:50%
to guide the eyes
to the center of the element.


122
00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.729 line:-1 position:50%
Now that our attention is
in the middle of our elements,


123
00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.466 line:-1 position:50%
let's look at the right size
for your controls.


124
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,402 position:50%
The minimum area that your
element needs for eye target


125
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,805 position:50%
is 60 points.


126
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,541 position:50%
But the element
can be smaller than 60 points.


127
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,676 position:50%
You can achieve
the minimum target area


128
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:20,313 position:50%
combining size and spacing.


129
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:24,117 position:50%
Use generous spacing between
elements in your layouts.


130
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,920 position:50%
This will help you target
quickly and accurately


131
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,089 position:50%
with your eyes.


132
00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:33.393 line:-1 position:50%
Again, it's very important to
respect the minimum target area


133
00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:37.130 line:-1 position:50%
of 60 points,
combining size and spacing


134
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.334 line:-1 position:50%
to make your UI look great
and easy to use with your eyes.


135
00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:43.103 line:-1 position:50%
Out of the box,
standard components


136
00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:45.472 line:-1 position:50%
have sizes that are
easy to target.


137
00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:47.974 line:-1 position:50%
Use these components
as much as you can.


138
00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:49.442 line:-1 position:50%
And if you use your own,


139
00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:53.079 line:-1 position:50%
make sure to follow
our guidelines on sizing.


140
00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.181 line:-1 position:50%
To learn more about
points and layout,


141
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:59.853 line:-1 position:50%
check out the session "Design
for spatial user interfaces."


142
00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:02.522 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we've learned about
how important the target area is


143
00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:04.758 line:-1 position:50%
for your eyes,
we have to make sure that


144
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:08.895 line:-1 position:50%
we maintain this target area
in any position in a space.


145
00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:13.166 line:-1 position:50%
For that, we need to understand
how to scale your UI.


146
00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.436 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at two different
scale mechanisms.


147
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:20.273 line:-1 position:50%
The system provides
dynamic scale for app windows.


148
00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:24.044 line:-1 position:50%
You can see how the window
scales larger as it moves away,


149
00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:26.846 line:-1 position:50%
and smaller as it moves close.


150
00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:30.617 line:-1 position:50%
Dynamic scale makes your UI
fill the same field of view


151
00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.320 line:-1 position:50%
and preserve the size
of the target areas,


152
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.389 line:-1 position:50%
no matter
where the window is positioned.


153
00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.026 line:-1 position:50%
If you use fixed scale instead,
your UI becomes smaller


154
00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:41.995 line:-1 position:50%
as it moves away.


155
00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:44.764 line:-1 position:50%
Fixed scale changes
the size of the interface


156
00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:49.569 line:-1 position:50%
and makes your app
difficult to use with your eyes.


157
00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.072 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at this side by side.


158
00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:55.442 line:-1 position:50%
Dynamic scale keeps your UI
and the target areas


159
00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:57.677 line:-1 position:50%
at the same size,
while fixed scale


160
00:07:57.677 --> 00:08:03.249 line:-1 position:50%
changes the size and makes
the target areas too small.


161
00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:07.287 line:-1 position:50%
When you create custom UI,
use dynamic scale to ensure


162
00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:10.590 line:-1 position:50%
that your eyes can always target
all the controls.


163
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.959 line:-1 position:50%
Besides scale,
orientation also affects


164
00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:14.894 line:-1 position:50%
the usability of your app.


165
00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:16.730 line:-1 position:50%
If the interface is at an angle,


166
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.567 line:-1 position:50%
it's difficult to read
and hard to use.


167
00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:24.504 line:-1 position:50%
That's why system windows are
always oriented to face people.


168
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:27.140 line:-1 position:50%
But if you create custom windows
in your app,


169
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.977 line:-1 position:50%
always make sure to keep your UI
facing the viewer.


170
00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:33.847 line:-1 position:50%
As we've just seen,
correct scale and orientation


171
00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.849 line:-1 position:50%
of windows and UI
are fundamental


172
00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.051 line:-1 position:50%
to ensure accuracy
with your eyes.


173
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:40.820 line:-1 position:50%
To learn more about how windows
on this platform behave,


174
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.625 line:-1 position:50%
check out the session
"Principles of spatial design."


175
00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:48.595 line:-1 position:50%
Eyes are a very novel input.
and it's really important


176
00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:51.831 line:-1 position:50%
to make your interfaces
respond to your eyes.


177
00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.833 line:-1 position:50%
When interactive
elements highlight,


178
00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:57.570 line:-1 position:50%
you understand that your eyes
are driving the interaction.


179
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.974 line:-1 position:50%
Let's see what happens when
you look at a group of buttons.


180
00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:05.412 line:-1 position:50%
See how they highlight
as you look at each one.


181
00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:08.048 line:-1 position:50%
All interactive elements
should be highlighted,


182
00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.283 line:-1 position:50%
and we do this
with a hover effect.


183
00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:12.152 line:-1 position:50%
But because your eyes
move quickly,


184
00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:16.656 line:-1 position:50%
the effect needs to be subtle
and work on top of any content,


185
00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:18.792 line:-1 position:50%
like when looking at
your favorite photos,


186
00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:23.229 line:-1 position:50%
reinforcing intention
without being prominent.


187
00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:26.900 line:-1 position:50%
Thanks to the hover effect,
all the system-provided controls


188
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.604 line:-1 position:50%
highlight when you look at them.


189
00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:34.107 line:-1 position:50%
If you create custom elements
for your apps,


190
00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:37.243 line:-1 position:50%
use hover effects
to add eye feedback


191
00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:40.613 line:-1 position:50%
and make your elements
feel responsive.


192
00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:44.350 line:-1 position:50%
Now, eye intention
is very sensitive information.


193
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:48.288 line:-1 position:50%
Privacy is our top priority
when dealing with eye data.


194
00:09:48.288 --> 00:09:51.658 line:-1 position:50%
The hover effect happens
out of your app's process,


195
00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:53.626 line:-1 position:50%
so you will only
get the information


196
00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:56.362 line:-1 position:50%
of which element is focused
when there is an interaction


197
00:09:56.362 --> 00:10:00.233 line:-1 position:50%
on the element
triggered by a gesture.


198
00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:02.569 line:-1 position:50%
Hovering on an element
with your eyes


199
00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:04.571 line:-1 position:50%
is a signal for intention.


200
00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:06.606 line:-1 position:50%
When you look at something
for a long time,


201
00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.908 line:-1 position:50%
we know that you are
interested in it.


202
00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:10.610 line:-1 position:50%
It is a great opportunity


203
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.481 line:-1 position:50%
to show you
more information about it.


204
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:17.383 line:-1 position:50%
For example,
buttons can have tooltips


205
00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:21.454 line:-1 position:50%
that reveal as you look at them.


206
00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:24.958 line:-1 position:50%
Also, tab bars expand
when you focus on them,


207
00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:29.229 line:-1 position:50%
showing a label for each tab.


208
00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:31.798 line:-1 position:50%
Lastly, focusing on
the microphone glyph


209
00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.300 line:-1 position:50%
inside a system-provided
search field


210
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.904 line:-1 position:50%
will trigger Speak to Search,
revealing this layer


211
00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:39.706 line:-1 position:50%
and allowing you
to perform a search


212
00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:42.742 line:-1 position:50%
using just eyes and voice.


213
00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:43.476 line:-1 position:50%
All these system elements


214
00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.512 line:-1 position:50%
give extra information
when you need it,


215
00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:49.115 line:-1 position:50%
while keeping a clean UI
when not in focus.


216
00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:52.152 line:-1 position:50%
Take advantage of them
when creating your apps.


217
00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.988 line:-1 position:50%
They are also built with privacy
in mind to ensure


218
00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:59.392 line:-1 position:50%
that no focus information
is being sent to the app.


219
00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:02.128 line:-1 position:50%
Eye intent also provides
great opportunities


220
00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:04.297 line:-1 position:50%
for assistive technology.


221
00:11:04.297 --> 00:11:07.400 line:-1 position:50%
For example, using
the Dwell Control feature,


222
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.970 line:-1 position:50%
you can select content
just with your eyes.


223
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.440 line:-1 position:50%
In this example, focusing on
a button for a short time


224
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.311 line:-1 position:50%
will show the Dwell Control UI
and will select the button


225
00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:22.415 line:-1 position:50%
without needing to perform
a tap gesture with your hand.


226
00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.717 line:-1 position:50%
So, what did we just learn


227
00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:28.054 line:-1 position:50%
about designing
interactions for eyes?


228
00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:30.156 line:-1 position:50%
We learned about how to make
your apps comfortable


229
00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:33.893 line:-1 position:50%
for your eyes by placing content
in front of the viewer,


230
00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:38.364 line:-1 position:50%
inside the field of view,
and using depth responsibly.


231
00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:42.535 line:-1 position:50%
Then we looked at how to design
interfaces that are easy to use


232
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:46.239 line:-1 position:50%
and how to guide your eyes
to the center of the elements.


233
00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:48.675 line:-1 position:50%
We also reinforced
how important it is


234
00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:51.644 line:-1 position:50%
to respect the minimum
target area of 60 points


235
00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:54.013 line:-1 position:50%
in your controls.


236
00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:56.916 line:-1 position:50%
How we should always
communicate interactivity


237
00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:59.786 line:-1 position:50%
and reinforce targeting
by adding hover effects


238
00:11:59.786 --> 00:12:01.554 line:-1 position:50%
to your elements.


239
00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:05.425 line:-1 position:50%
And lastly, how we can
take advantage of UI elements


240
00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:10.029 line:-1 position:50%
that reveal extra information
on eye intent.


241
00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:12.865 line:-1 position:50%
I think this was great,
and there's even more.


242
00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:15.501 line:-1 position:50%
We've seen that eyes are a
fantastic target mechanism,


243
00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:17.237 line:-1 position:50%
and they become
much more powerful


244
00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.972 line:-1 position:50%
when you combine them
with hands.


245
00:12:18.972 --> 00:12:21.641 line:-1 position:50%
Now, I'll hand it over
to Eugene to talk about it.


246
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:22.909 line:-1 position:50%
Eugene: Thanks, Israel.


247
00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.410 line:-1 position:50%
Let's talk about hands.


248
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.379 line:-1 position:50%
Combined with eyes
for targeting,


249
00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:27.914 line:-1 position:50%
hand gestures
are the primary way


250
00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.516 line:-1 position:50%
to interact across the system.


251
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,485 position:50%
Pinching your fingers together
is an equivalent


252
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,588 position:50%
of pressing on the screen
of your phone.


253
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,391 position:50%
The system supports
other familiar gestures.


254
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,828 position:50%
For example, you can
pinch and drag to scroll,


255
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:48,334 position:50%
and perform two-handed
gestures like zoom and rotate.


256
00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:51.371 line:-1 position:50%
Notice how in all these cases,
UI feedback continues


257
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.740 line:-1 position:50%
the motion of the hand,
which really helps it feel


258
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.276 line:-1 position:50%
connected to the gesture.


259
00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.711 line:-1 position:50%
The gestures work the same way
across the system


260
00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:01.814 line:-1 position:50%
and follow the logic similar
to the Multi-Touch gestures.


261
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,517 position:50%
This means that people can
really focus on the experience,


262
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,154 position:50%
instead of having to think about
how to perform the interaction.


263
00:13:08.154 --> 00:13:10.757 line:-1 position:50%
This is why you should
lean on these familiar patterns


264
00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:12.458 line:-1 position:50%
when designing your experience,


265
00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.127 line:-1 position:50%
and make sure
to respond to gestures


266
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.463 line:-1 position:50%
in a way that matches
people's expectations.


267
00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.465 line:-1 position:50%
In some cases,
part of your experience


268
00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.067 line:-1 position:50%
might be a unique behavior


269
00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:23.836 line:-1 position:50%
that can't easily be expressed
with standard gestures.


270
00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:26.572 line:-1 position:50%
In this case, you may
want to define a custom one.


271
00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:27.907 line:-1 position:50%
Here are some tips on how


272
00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:30.810 line:-1 position:50%
to make a successful
custom gesture.


273
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.379 line:-1 position:50%
First, make sure that
the gesture is easy to explain


274
00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:37.317 line:-1 position:50%
and perform so that people
can learn how to use it quickly.


275
00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.986 line:-1 position:50%
It is also important
to avoid gesture conflicts.


276
00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:42.055 line:-1 position:50%
Your custom gesture needs to be
distinctly different


277
00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:44.891 line:-1 position:50%
from the standard system set
or common hand movements


278
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:47.560 line:-1 position:50%
people might use
in the conversation.


279
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.296 line:-1 position:50%
This has to be a gesture that
people can consistently repeat


280
00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:51.864 line:-1 position:50%
without strain or fatigue,


281
00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:55.034 line:-1 position:50%
and that has a low rate
of false activations.


282
00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:57.670 line:-1 position:50%
Be mindful of people who
are using assistive technologies


283
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.505 line:-1 position:50%
to interact across the system


284
00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.675 line:-1 position:50%
and consider how your gesture
will work in those cases.


285
00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.444 line:-1 position:50%
To learn more
about accessibility,


286
00:14:04.444 --> 00:14:08.481 line:-1 position:50%
check out the session "Create
accessible spatial experiences."


287
00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:10.049 line:-1 position:50%
Gestures can also mean
different things


288
00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.685 line:-1 position:50%
to different people,
so make sure your custom gesture


289
00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:16.122 line:-1 position:50%
doesn't send messages
you didn't intend.


290
00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:18.391 line:-1 position:50%
All of this may be
a tricky balance to hit,


291
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:20.093 line:-1 position:50%
so it's always worth
considering a fallback


292
00:14:20.093 --> 00:14:22.929 line:-1 position:50%
in the form of a UI affordance.


293
00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:25.631 line:-1 position:50%
One of the most exciting
aspects of our input model


294
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:29.302 line:-1 position:50%
is the opportunity to use eyes
as a signal of intent.


295
00:14:29.302 --> 00:14:32.038 line:-1 position:50%
Using eye direction
combined with hand gestures,


296
00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.407 line:-1 position:50%
we can create precise
and satisfying interactions


297
00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:36.542 line:-1 position:50%
that are not possible
on other platforms.


298
00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.779 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at the zoom gesture
again to see what I mean.


299
00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:43.049 line:-1 position:50%
At the start of the gesture,
the origin point of the zoom


300
00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.751 line:-1 position:50%
is determined by where
within the image


301
00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:47.887 line:-1 position:50%
your eyes are focused
at that moment.


302
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,790 position:50%
This results in that particular
area to be magnified


303
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,526 position:50%
and centered as you zoom in.


304
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:56,362 position:50%
As a result, you can
navigate the image easily


305
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,899 position:50%
just by looking around and
performing this simple gesture.


306
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.301 line:-1 position:50%
This feels really magical
and 100 percent expected


307
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:03.803 line:-1 position:50%
at the same time.


308
00:15:03.803 --> 00:15:06.105 line:-1 position:50%
The point you are looking at
naturally indicates


309
00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:08.441 line:-1 position:50%
the intent of that interaction.


310
00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:12.812 line:-1 position:50%
Another example of this behavior
is pointer movement in Markup.


311
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,815 position:50%
To draw, you control
the brush cursor with your hand,


312
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,484 position:50%
similar to a mouse pointer,
but then if you look


313
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,453 position:50%
to the other side
of the canvas and tap,


314
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,723 position:50%
the cursor jumps there landing
right where you're looking.


315
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,324 position:50%
This creates a sense of accuracy


316
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,228 position:50%
and helps to cover
the large canvas quickly.


317
00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.930 line:-1 position:50%
These are examples
of interactions


318
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.900 line:-1 position:50%
that use eye direction
to make simple behaviors


319
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.002 line:-1 position:50%
more precise and satisfying.


320
00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:38.504 line:-1 position:50%
Eyes are used not only
to target elements,


321
00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:41.240 line:-1 position:50%
but to implicitly provide
a more granular location


322
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.742 line:-1 position:50%
for that interaction.


323
00:15:42.742 --> 00:15:45.478 line:-1 position:50%
This is a really powerful aspect
of our input model


324
00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:47.313 line:-1 position:50%
that allows us
to respond to interaction


325
00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:49.982 line:-1 position:50%
in a much more intelligent way.


326
00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:52.218 line:-1 position:50%
Now let's talk about
direct touch.


327
00:15:52.218 --> 00:15:55.021 line:-1 position:50%
Across the system, we support
being able to reach out


328
00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:57.890 line:-1 position:50%
and use your fingertips
to interact.


329
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,059 position:50%
For example, you can bring
Safari close to you


330
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,662 position:50%
and scroll the page directly.


331
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,297 position:50%
You can also use
both your hands


332
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,899 position:50%
to type on the virtual keyboard


333
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,035 position:50%
and even
have more spatial experiences,


334
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:14,173 position:50%
manipulating 3D content
within your arm's reach.


335
00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:17.343 line:-1 position:50%
Interactions at a distance
stay comfortable for a long time


336
00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:20.046 line:-1 position:50%
because it's easy to target
controls with your eyes,


337
00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:21.447 line:-1 position:50%
and your hands can stay rested


338
00:16:21.447 --> 00:16:23.850 line:-1 position:50%
while performing
minimal gestures.


339
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.551 line:-1 position:50%
When designing
for direct interaction,


340
00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:27.687 line:-1 position:50%
we have to keep in mind
that holding hands in the air


341
00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.789 line:-1 position:50%
will cause fatigue
after a while.


342
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,458 position:50%
Still, certain apps will benefit
from placing content


343
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,328 position:50%
within arm's reach
for direct touch,


344
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,763 position:50%
like experiences
that invite up close inspection


345
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,266 position:50%
or object manipulation;


346
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,435 position:50%
or any interactive mechanic
that builds on top


347
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:46,172 position:50%
of the muscle memory
from real-world experiences;


348
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,374 position:50%
and generally,
whenever physical activity


349
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,377 position:50%
is at the center
of the experience.


350
00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:54.647 line:-1 position:50%
Lack of tactile response
is another thing to consider


351
00:16:54.647 --> 00:16:56.916 line:-1 position:50%
when designing
for direct interaction.


352
00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:59.285 line:-1 position:50%
Every time we touch something
in the physical world,


353
00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:02.021 line:-1 position:50%
our hands receive
lots of multisensory feedback,


354
00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:04.490 line:-1 position:50%
which is essential
to our perception.


355
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.158 line:-1 position:50%
None of this is happening
when we reach out


356
00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.660 line:-1 position:50%
and touch virtual content.


357
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.395 line:-1 position:50%
And to make
that interaction work,


358
00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:12.231 line:-1 position:50%
we need to compensate for
the missing sensory information


359
00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:14.233 line:-1 position:50%
with other types of feedback.


360
00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:15.835 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at how we approached
this challenge


361
00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:18.170 line:-1 position:50%
with keyboard buttons.


362
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.673 line:-1 position:50%
The buttons are actually
raised above the platter


363
00:17:20.673 --> 00:17:23.109 line:-1 position:50%
to invite pushing them directly.


364
00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.678 line:-1 position:50%
While the finger
is above the keyboard,


365
00:17:25.678 --> 00:17:28.381 line:-1 position:50%
buttons display a hover state
and a highlight


366
00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:31.517 line:-1 position:50%
that gets brighter as you
approach the button surface.


367
00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:33.252 line:-1 position:50%
It provides a proximity cue


368
00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:35.488 line:-1 position:50%
and helps guide
the finger to target.


369
00:17:35.488 --> 00:17:37.223 line:-1 position:50%
At the moment of contact,
the state change


370
00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:39.525 line:-1 position:50%
is quick and responsive,
and is accompanied


371
00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:40.960 line:-1 position:50%
by matching
spatial sound effect.

[DIGITAL KEYSTROKES]


373
00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:45.765 line:-1 position:50%
These additional layers
of feedback are really important


374
00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:48.401 line:-1 position:50%
to compensate
for missing tactile information,


375
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:52.271 line:-1 position:50%
and to make direct interactions
feel reliable and satisfying.

Audio plays a special role
in connecting input


377
00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:56.709 line:-1 position:50%
with virtual content

To recap,
here are the takeaways


381
00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:06.752 line:-1 position:50%
for designing
interactions with hands.


382
00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:09.255 line:-1 position:50%
Use gesture language
consistent with the system


383
00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.057 line:-1 position:50%
so people can focus
on the content


384
00:18:11.057 --> 00:18:13.592 line:-1 position:50%
instead of the interaction.


385
00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:16.395 line:-1 position:50%
Be careful to only introduce
custom gestures


386
00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.197 line:-1 position:50%
when the desired behavior
can't be achieved

with the standard set.


388
00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:22.802 line:-1 position:50%
Look for ways
to improve your interaction


389
00:18:22.802 --> 00:18:26.038 line:-1 position:50%
using eyes
as a signal of intent.


390
00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:27.707 line:-1 position:50%
Only use direct interaction


391
00:18:27.707 --> 00:18:29.775 line:-1 position:50%
when it's at the core
of your experience.


392
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:32.378 line:-1 position:50%
And if you do,
provide extensive feedback


393
00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:36.082 line:-1 position:50%
to compensate for missing
sensory information.


394

are comfortable and accessible.


401
00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:57.937 line:-1 position:50%
By running your app on device,
people welcome your work


402
00:18:57.937 --> 00:19:01.173 line:-1 position:50%
into their space and give it
their full attention.


403
00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:03.642 line:-1 position:50%
Software is no longer contained
within a screen.


404
00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:06.445 line:-1 position:50%
Instead, it's allowed to occupy
a more significant portion


405
00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:08.381 line:-1 position:50%
of people's
physical surroundings


406
00:19:08.381 --> 00:19:11.083 line:-1 position:50%
and react to their
natural body movements.


407
00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:12.885 line:-1 position:50%
Using hands to interact
with virtual content


408
00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:15.287 line:-1 position:50%
is also something very new
for most people.


409
00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:16.956 line:-1 position:50%
That's why it's so important
to guide them


410
00:19:16.956 --> 00:19:18.991 line:-1 position:50%
by providing clear feedback
and to rely on


411
00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:21.861 line:-1 position:50%
familiar interaction patterns
where possible.


412
00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:24.263 line:-1 position:50%
As we know from designing
for other platforms,


413
00:19:24.263 --> 00:19:25.831 line:-1 position:50%
great input experience
is the one


414
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.100 line:-1 position:50%
that you don't
have to think about.


415
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.302 line:-1 position:50%
Software response becomes
a natural continuation


416
00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:31.570 line:-1 position:50%
of your body movement


417
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.007 line:-1 position:50%
and perfectly matches
the interaction intent.


418
00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.209 line:-1 position:50%
Our ability to use eyes
as the foundation


419
00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:39.745 line:-1 position:50%
of the input model
opens up opportunities


420
00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:43.182 line:-1 position:50%
to respond to interaction
with magical precision.


421
00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.684 line:-1 position:50%
We think it's really powerful,
and we hope you will use it


422
00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:47.987 line:-1 position:50%
to create delightful
and novel interactions
