00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.780 line:-2 align:center
Hello, I'm Rachel.
I'm an engineer on the Safari team.


4
00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:17.017 line:-2 align:center
Today, I'm excited to share
what's new in web apps.


5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,652 line:-1
We've been on a journey with web apps


6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,487 line:-2
since the release
of the very first iPhone,


7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,523 line:-1
and they just keep getting better.


8
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:26,627 line:-2
In iOS and iPadOS 16.4,
we added notifications


9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,061 line:-1
to Home Screen web apps,


10
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:31,798 line:-2
using the Web Push standard
with support for badging.


11
00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:37.471 line:-2 align:center
We also added API for iOS and iPadOS
browsers to adopt Add to Home Screen.


12
00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:43.977 line:-2 align:center
New in iOS and iPadOS 17,
Add to Home Screen is now available


13
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.113 line:-1 align:center
in Safari View Controller.


14
00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:51.818 line:-2 align:center
So now users can add Home Screen web apps
in iOS browsers and many in-app browsers.


15
00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:56.356 line:-2 align:center
New in macOS Sonoma,
we now have web apps on Mac.


16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,027 line:-2
Web apps on Mac let me focus
on websites that I use all the time


17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,498 line:-2
in a dedicated way that's separate
from the rest of my browsing.


18
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:07.668 line:-2 align:center
Similar to iOS,
the way I can create a web app


19
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,037 line:-1
is by adding a website to the Dock.


20
00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:15.008 line:-2 align:center
I'm browsing Wikipedia,
and I'd like to add it to the Dock.


21
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:19,046 line:-2
I'm going to open the File menu
and select "Add to Dock..."


22
00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.350 line:-2 align:center
Now I can see the icon,
name and URL of this site.


23
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,385 line:-1
I'm going to simplify the name.


24
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:30,023 line:-2
I could also modify the icon if wanted to,
but this one looks good.


25
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:33,727 line:-2
I'll press “Add”,
and now there's a new icon in my Dock.


26
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.865 line:-2 align:center
I'm going to close Safari for now
and open the Wikipedia web app.


27
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,636 line:-1
Now once I've launched this web app,


28
00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.772 line:-2 align:center
I can use this site in a way
that feels more like an app.


29
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,774 line:-1
I'm still logged into my account.


30
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:52,446 line:-2
That's because Safari copies website
cookies when it is added to the Dock.


31
00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.315 line:-2 align:center
There is a simplified toolbar
with navigation buttons.


32
00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.186 line:-2 align:center
and the theme color for the site
blends into the toolbar.


33
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,323 line:-2
As a developer, you can control
whether the navigation buttons are shown.


34
00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:07.227 line:-2 align:center
Today, we're going to first cover
how web apps on Mac work out of the box


35
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,296 line:-1
for all websites.


36
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,066 line:-2
Then I'll tell you about how you can
customize the behavior of your web app


37
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.637 line:-2 align:center
to create the best experience
for your users.


38
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.741 line:-2 align:center
Finally, I'll discuss notifications,
including sounds and badging,


39
00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:22.543 line:-1 align:center
giving you a way to reach your users


40
00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.979 line:-2 align:center
even when they're not actively
using your web app.


41
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:29,082 line:-2
Let's start with how web apps work
out of the box.


42
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:33,220 line:-2
Web apps on Mac work great
with no adoption required by developers.


43
00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:36.023 line:-1 align:center
Any website can become a web app.


44
00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:39.126 line:-2 align:center
Web apps on Mac are fully integrated
with many of the features


45
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,296 line:-2
that you would expect
from a native app on macOS.


46
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,168 line:-2
Let's take a look at the web app
that I already added to my Dock.


47
00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:50.871 line:-2 align:center
This site doesn't have
any web app-specific features,


48
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,472 line:-1
such as a web app manifest,


49
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,742 line:-2
and it looks great and functions
as a standalone web app.


50
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:00,447 line:-2
Like all Mac apps,
web apps work great with Stage Manager,


51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,917 line:-2
Mission Control, and keyboard shortcuts,
such as command + tab.


52
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:09,256 line:-2
Web apps can be opened from the Dock,
Launchpad, and Spotlight Search.


53
00:03:10.858 --> 00:03:14.094 line:-2 align:center
Web apps work with AutoFill credentials
from iCloud Keychain


54
00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.463 line:-2 align:center
and from third-party apps
that have adopted


55
00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:19.466 line:-2 align:center
the Credential Provider
Extension API.


56
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,970 line:-1
We put people in control of their privacy,


57
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:28.208 line:-2 align:center
so they can grant camera, microphone,
and location access to your web app


58
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:31,178 line:-2
in the same ways as native apps,
through system permission prompts


59
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,082 line:-2
and in the Privacy & Security
section of System Settings.


60
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,984 line:-1
That was the default behavior,


61
00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:38.819 line:-2 align:center
but you may want to customize
the experience


62
00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:40.654 line:-1 align:center
for people who use your website.


63
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,357 line:-2
When a webpage is added
to the Dock on macOS,


64
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.626 line:-1 align:center
it is always treated as a web app.


65
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,096 line:-2
As a developer, you can control
the initial behavior of the toolbar


66
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,764 line:-1
for the web app's window.


67
00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:54.701 line:-2 align:center
The default behavior shows a toolbar
with navigation controls.


68
00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:56.737 line:-2 align:center
This is helpful
for navigating around sites


69
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.506 line:-2 align:center
that don't have
their own navigation controls.


70
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,845 line:-2
You may not want to show the toolbar if
your site has its own navigation controls


71
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,049 line:-2
or navigation controls aren't necessary
in the context of your site.


72
00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.585 line:-2 align:center
This is called
the standalone display mode.


73
00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:17.457 line:-2 align:center
The default behavior on iOS
is different from macOS.


74
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:21,862 line:-2
A website that has been added to the
Home Screen opens in the default browser.


75
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,232 line:-2
This provides a quick way
for users to access a commonly-used site


76
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,602 line:-1
right from the Home Screen.


77
00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:31.972 line:-2 align:center
Websites that have been added
to the Home Screen on iOS and iPadOS,


78
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:36,476 line:-2
with the standalone display mode,
will become a Home Screen web app.


79
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.614 line:-2 align:center
Home Screen web apps have a standalone,
app-like experience on iOS,


80
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:44,284 line:-2
with separate cookies and storage
from the browser.


81
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:47,588 line:-2
There's no browser-provided UI,
such as a toolbar,


82
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:50.657 line:-1 align:center
and all the content is from the web page.


83
00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:54.628 line:-2 align:center
If you want your site to be able
to use Web Push and badging on iOS,


84
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,830 line:-2
then you should use
the standalone display mode.


85
00:04:57.898 --> 00:05:01.935 line:-2 align:center
To set the display mode.
I'll add a web app manifest to my site.


86
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,738 line:-2
The web app manifest is a way
for a website to communicate


87
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:09,676 line:-2
its intended behavior for web app-related features with the system.


88
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,179 line:-1
To add a web app manifest to your website,


89
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:17,918 line:-2
simply add a link with rel="manifest"
to a JSON file in the head of your HTML.


90
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:20.387 line:-1 align:center
I called mine “manifest.json”.


91
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,624 line:-1
In the corresponding manifest file,


92
00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:26.727 line:-2 align:center
add the keys and values
that apply to your website.


93
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,595 line:-1
First I'll set the name


94
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.698 line:-2 align:center
since this is what I want to be used
as the web app name,


95
00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:34.768 line:-2 align:center
not the website title,
since mine is pretty long.


96
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,806 line:-2
To change the display mode,
I'll set display to “standalone”.


97
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,976 line:-2
On macOS,
the web app will not have a toolbar.


98
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,878 line:-1
On iOS and iPadOS,


99
00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:47.181 line:-2 align:center
the site will open
in a Home Screen web app,


100
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,416 line:-1
instead of in the default browser.


101
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,986 line:-2
Now, let's cover where links clicked
within the web app open.


102
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.789 line:-1 align:center
All web apps have an associated scope.


103
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,092 line:-2
Links within the scope
open within the web app.


104
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:03,764 line:-2
The default scope is the host of
the webpage used to create the web app.


105
00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:07.367 line:-2 align:center
You can further refine the scope
using the web app manifest


106
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:11,038 line:-2
to limit it to a specific path
on your site.


107
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,608 line:-2
For example, when I click on this link
in the Browser Pets web app


108
00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:16.977 line:-1 align:center
to go to another page “webkittens”,


109
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,179 line:-2
you'll notice that we stay
within the web app


110
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:24,318 line:-2
since Web Kittens is just another page
on our site under example.com.


111
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:26.820 line:-1 align:center
Now when I click on a link to apple.com


112
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,889 line:-1
that will open in my default browser,


113
00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:32.359 line:-2 align:center
since that is outside the scope
of example.com.


114
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,762 line:-2
If I wanted links to Web Kittens
to open in the default browser,


115
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,631 line:-1
like that link to apple.com,


116
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,400 line:-2
then I can adjust the scope
in the web app manifest.


117
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:47,140 line:-2
To adjust the scope, I'll first start
by adding the "start_url".


118
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:51,879 line:-2
The start_url is the URL that is loaded
when the web app is first opened.


119
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:55,249 line:-2
This will open the home page
for Browser Pets.


120
00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:57.184 line:-1 align:center
Now I'll add the scope.


121
00:06:57.217 --> 00:07:01.588 line:-2 align:center
Suppose I want to separate Browser Pets
and Web Kittens into different web apps,


122
00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:04.791 line:-2 align:center
then I could limit the scope
to just Browser Pets.


123
00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:07.828 line:-2 align:center
The scope is a subdirectory
of the manifest URL.


124
00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:12.099 line:-2 align:center
In this case,
the scope will be example.com/browserpets.


125
00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:14.968 line:-2 align:center
Any links within the scope
will stay within the web app


126
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:19,373 line:-2
and any links outside the scope
will open in the default browser.


127
00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:21.542 line:-1 align:center
In Home Screen web apps on iOS,


128
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,311 line:-2
links outside the scope
will open in Safari View Controller.


129
00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:28.615 line:-2 align:center
So when I tap this link
in this Home Screen web app,


130
00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:30.951 line:-1 align:center
it opens in Safari View Controller.


131
00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:35.522 line:-2 align:center
We need to log in to get the most
out of many of the websites


132
00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:37.891 line:-1 align:center
that we use on a daily basis.


133
00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:42.062 line:-2 align:center
As I mentioned earlier, to make web apps
work great out of the box for most users,


134
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:46,266 line:-2
we copy website cookies when
a web app on Mac is added to the Dock.


135
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,636 line:-2
In many cases, users stay logged in
when the web app is opened


136
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,805 line:-1
for a seamless experience.


137
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,009 line:-2
From that point on, cookies are separate
between Safari and the web app.


138
00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:59.713 line:-2 align:center
If the authentication state
is solely stored in cookies for your site,


139
00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:02.683 line:-2 align:center
then your users should be
automatically logged into the web app


140
00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:04.151 line:-1 align:center
when they add it to their Dock


141
00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:06.887 line:-2 align:center
since Safari copies the website's cookies
to the web app


142
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.489 line:-1 align:center
when it is added to the Dock.


143
00:08:09.523 --> 00:08:14.161 line:-2 align:center
Some websites split authentication state
between cookies and local storage.


144
00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:17.431 line:-2 align:center
Since local storage is not copied
when a web app is created,


145
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,666 line:-2
users would have
to re-authenticate to continue


146
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.202 line:-1 align:center
using your site as a web app.


147
00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:24.805 line:-2 align:center
To create a smooth experience
for your users,


148
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,307 line:-2
keep authentication state
saved within cookies.


149
00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:30.944 line:-2 align:center
As I mentioned before,
links that go beyond


150
00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:34.281 line:-2 align:center
the scope of the web app
will open in the default browser.


151
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:37,584 line:-2
If the user logs into your web page
in their default browser,


152
00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:41.121 line:-2 align:center
they will not be logged into the web app
that has already been added to the Dock,


153
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:45,592 line:-2
since cookies and storage are separate
after the web app is added.


154
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,328 line:-2
Authentication through OAuth
on a third-party domain


155
00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:50.531 line:-1 align:center
will still open in your web app.


156
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,432 line:-1
This is done through heuristics.


157
00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:56.603 line:-2 align:center
If you test and find that your OAuth flow
opens the authentication experience


158
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,438 line:-1
in the user's default browser,


159
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:02,242 line:-2
please send us feedback
using apple.com/feedback.


160
00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:06.980 line:-2 align:center
If you want to ensure your OAuth flows
do not open in the user's default browser,


161
00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:09.917 line:-1 align:center
you can use window.open.


162
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,120 line:-2
Links loaded through window.open
will always open in the web app


163
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,322 line:-1
regardless of scope.


164
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:19,526 line:-2
Apple is engaging with standards bodies
to offer developers a way to indicate


165
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.528 line:-1 align:center
that links to authentication domains


166
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,830 line:-2
should stay within
the context of the web app.


167
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,669 line:-2
Some websites use email links to
automatically sign in users


168
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,838 line:-1
by opening the link.


169
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:34.007 line:-2 align:center
Since links from email will open
in the default browser,


170
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:38,612 line:-2
this will not automatically sign users in
to the web app that they already have.


171
00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:42.115 line:-2 align:center
You may want to provide an alternative
one-time code in the email


172
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:47,187 line:-2
that your user can easily enter
into the sign-in flow on your site.


173
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:50,858 line:0
For a more convenient and
more secure authentication experience,


174
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:54,928 line:0
consider adopting passkeys
for authentication on your site.


175
00:09:54,962 --> 00:10:00,601 line:0
Check out "Meet passkeys"
from WWDC22 for more information.


176
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,971 line:-2
Notifications in web apps on Mac
is an exciting addition


177
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,807 line:-2
to our existing standards-based
Web Push support


178
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:13.046 line:-2 align:center
for Safari in macOS Ventura
and in Home Screen web apps in iOS 16.4.


179
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,916 line:-2
Now I'll tell you
how you can integrate notifications,


180
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:19.953 line:-2 align:center
including badging and sounds,
into your web apps.


181
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:23,857 line:-2
If you have already implemented
Web Push according to web standards,


182
00:10:23.891 --> 00:10:26.593 line:-2 align:center
then push notifications should work
for your web page


183
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,963 line:-2
as a web app on Mac
with no additional work.


184
00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:34.001 line:-2 align:center
Notifications for web apps on Mac
use the web app's application icon


185
00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:35.669 line:-1 align:center
in the notification.


186
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:42,276 line:-2
Web Push notifications originating
from Safari show the Safari icon,


187
00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:45.712 line:-2 align:center
while notifications from web apps on Mac
use the web app's icon


188
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:49,316 line:-2
in the notification,
providing context to users.


189
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,986 line:-2
You may want a sound to play
on the user's device


190
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.889 line:-2 align:center
when they receive a notification
to get their attention,


191
00:10:55,923 --> 00:11:00,561 line:-2
so now I'll tell you how that works
on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.


192
00:11:00.594 --> 00:11:02.696 line:-1 align:center
Using the Notification API,


193
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:06,567 line:-2
you can specify if your notification
should have sound or not.


194
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,502 line:-1
Following platform conventions,


195
00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:11.605 line:-1 align:center
sound is on by default on iOS and iPadOS,


196
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:15,175 line:-1
and sound is off by default on macOS.


197
00:11:15.209 --> 00:11:20.047 line:-2 align:center
To override the platform default,
explicitly specify a silent value.


198
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.617 line:-2 align:center
If the notification should be silent,
set silent to true in the options


199
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,620 line:-1
when requesting your notification.


200
00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:31.091 line:-2 align:center
If the notification should make a sound,
then set silent to false.


201
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,260 line:-1
Just like for native app notifications,


202
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:37,464 line:-2
users can control notification sounds
using notifications settings.


203
00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:42.002 line:-2 align:center
Badging is useful to alert users
that there is something to address


204
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,036 line:-1
in the web app.


205
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:49,009 line:-2
Just like for Home Screen web apps
in iOS 16.4,


206
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,612 line:-1
web apps on Mac support badging.


207
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:55,182 line:-2
Since badging and push notifications
are so closely associated


208
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,185 line:-1
on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS,


209
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,321 line:-2
when users allow a web app
to send notifications,


210
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:05,592 line:-2
that includes permissions
for the web app to use badging.


211
00:12:05.626 --> 00:12:08.161 line:-2 align:center
Badges can be updated
when the web app is open


212
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:11,598 line:-2
and when push events are being handled
in the background.


213
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:14,701 line:-2
Users can always configure badges
in Settings.


214
00:12:16.503 --> 00:12:19.573 line:-2 align:center
For more information
on adopting the Badging API,


215
00:12:19.606 --> 00:12:23.310 line:-2 align:center
check out "Badging for Home Screen
Web Apps" on webkit.org.


216
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,049 line:0
For more information on adopting
standards-based Web Push,


217
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:33,353 line:0

from WWDC22.


218
00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:38.992 line:-2 align:center
Home Screen web apps on iOS
and web apps on Mac integrate with Focus


219
00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:42.296 line:-2 align:center
to give users control
over their notifications.


220
00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:46.433 line:-2 align:center
Users can set which notifications
they want to see in different Focus modes


221
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:50,938 line:-2
and have their preferences applied
to Focus modes across all their devices.


222
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:54,675 line:-2
Let's take a look back
at our web app manifest.


223
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:59,246 line:-2
The "id" manifest key defines
unique web apps within the same domain.


224
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:03.217 line:-2 align:center
This is used for syncing Focus modes and
can be useful if you have multiple parts


225
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,488 line:-2
of your website that should be treated as
distinct web apps under the same domain.


226
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:10,991 line:-2
If you only have one web app
for a given domain,


227
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,260 line:-1
then you don't need to set the id.


228
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,496 line:-2
The fallback if there is no
id provided is the start_url.


229
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,466 line:-2
One of the great parts of Focus
is how Focus modes sync


230
00:13:19.499 --> 00:13:21.401 line:-1 align:center
across all of a user's devices.


231
00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:27.007 line:-2 align:center
Both you and your users control
how Focus mode settings are synced.


232
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,678 line:-2
You as a developer may have distinct web
apps for different parts of your site.


233
00:13:31.712 --> 00:13:37.317 line:-2 align:center
For example, you may have one web app
for your shop and one web app for forums.


234
00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:42.222 line:-2 align:center
Here, the “Name" column is the name of
your web app on the user's iPhone or Mac.


235
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:45,859 line:-2
The id key of the web app manifest
can be used to indicate


236
00:13:45.893 --> 00:13:49.229 line:-2 align:center
that a web app created
with the id "shop" is for your shop


237
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:52,032 line:-2
and the web app created
with the id "forums" is for the forums


238
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,800 line:-1
for your community.


239
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,803 line:-2
This way, your users can set
different notification preferences


240
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:00,007 line:-1
for your Shop and Forums web apps.


241
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,878 line:-2
Focus modes sync across a user's device
when the name and id align.


242
00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:08.782 line:-2 align:center
Users can create multiple instances
of a web app for a given site


243
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,017 line:-1
on their device.


244
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,754 line:-2
This can be useful for separating
work and personal accounts.


245
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:16,590 line:-2
The user can choose different names
for each instance.


246
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:20,093 line:-2
In this example
"Forums" and "Forums - Work".


247
00:14:20.127 --> 00:14:23.230 line:-2 align:center
This way users can set different
notification and Focus settings


248
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:27,401 line:-2
for each of their Forums web apps
that sync across all their devices.


249
00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:32.573 line:-2 align:center
There are several APIs
that we added to WebKit this year


250
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:35,475 line:-2
that may be helpful to you
when creating your website.


251
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,680 line:-2
We have support for
the User Activation API,


252
00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:44.651 line:-2 align:center
which tells the website when a transient
or sticky user activation has occurred.


253
00:14:44.685 --> 00:14:47.988 line:-2 align:center
This is helpful for you to determine
if it is okay to call a function


254
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,957 line:-1
that depends on user activation,


255
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,794 line:-2
such as requesting permission
to send notifications.


256
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:57,130 line:-2
We shipped the updated
and un-prefixed Fullscreen API


257
00:14:57,164 --> 00:15:01,635 line:-1
in Safari 16.4 for macOS and iPadOS.


258
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:06,173 line:-2
We also added preliminary support
for the Screen Orientation API,


259
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,977 line:-2
including the type and angle properties
and the onChange event handler.


260
00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:16.483 line:-2 align:center

262
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:21,955 line:-2
Web apps on Mac
work out of the box for all websites.


263
00:15:21.989 --> 00:15:24.925 line:-2 align:center
You can use the web app manifest
to customize the behavior


264
00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:28.128 line:-2 align:center
for when your website
is added to the Dock.


265
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.631 line:-2 align:center
You can implement features
that are tailored for web apps,


266
00:15:30.664 --> 00:15:33.400 line:-1 align:center
such as Web Push and badging.


267
