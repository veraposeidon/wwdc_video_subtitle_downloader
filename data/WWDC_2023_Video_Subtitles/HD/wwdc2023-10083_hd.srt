Eric Chiu: Hi there.
My name is Eric,


5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,013 line:-1
and today I'll be giving
a walkthrough


6
00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.982 line:-1 position:50%
of Reality Composer Pro.


7
00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:16.683 line:-1 position:50%
You might remember in 2019,


8
00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.218 line:-1 position:50%
we introduced
Reality Composer


9
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,621 line:-1
to get your feet wet
with augmented reality.


10
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:23,056 line:-1
Now, with
the release of xrOS,


11
00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.226 line:-1 position:50%
we're introducing
Reality Composer Pro,


12
00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:29.129 line:-1 position:50%
a pro developer tool
to help you compose, edit,


13
00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.599 line:-1 position:50%
and preview 3D content.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.234 line:-1 position:50%
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
Using Reality Composer Pro,


15
00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:36.803 line:-1 position:50%
we can create immersive
3D experiences.


16
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,740 line:-1
Let's take this interactive
Dioramas app as an example.


17
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,509 line:-1
We can check out fantastic
national parks at room scale,


18
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,711 line:-1
along with some points
of interest.


19
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.679 line:-1 position:50%
In this session,
we'll go through


20
00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.781 line:-1 position:50%
various features
in Reality Composer Pro


21
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.684 line:-1 position:50%
that we can leverage
to build this scene.


22
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,819 line:-1
We'll begin
with a fresh project,


23
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:56,323 line:-1
then go through the general UI
of Reality Composer Pro,


24
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,358 line:-1
compose our main scene
using a 3D terrain


25
00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.761 line:-1 position:50%
and location pins,


26
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.430 line:-1 position:50%
add some clouds
on top of our terrain,


27
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,033 line:-1
and a few birds with audio.


28
00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:07.467 line:-1 position:50%
We'll take advantage
of statistics


29
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,304 line:-1
to optimize the performance,
and finally check out


30
00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.673 line:-1 position:50%
an on-device preview
of our scene.


31
00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.708 line:-1 position:50%
Let's get started.


32
00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.576 line:-1 position:50%
First, setting up our project.


33
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,478 line:-1
There are two ways to set up.


34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,048 line:-1
One way is to go to
Xcode > Open Developer Tool


35
00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:23.584 line:-1 position:50%
and open Reality Composer Pro
from there.


36
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:25.118 line:-1 position:50%
This is recommended
if we want to create


37
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,654 line:-1
a standalone
Reality Composer Pro project.


38
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,623 line:-1
The other way is to create
a new Xcode project


39
00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:31.959 line:-1 position:50%
using the xrOS app template.


40
00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.894 line:-1 position:50%
The template automatically
generates and links


41
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:38,031 line:-1
a Reality Composer Pro project
to the Xcode project.


42
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.933 line:-1 position:50%
This is recommended
if we want to use


43
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.437 line:-1 position:50%
a Reality Composer Pro project
in an Xcode app.


44
00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:45.405 line:-1 position:50%
We'll build our Dioramas
app this way.


45
00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:53.180 line:-1 position:50%
The Reality Composer Pro
project is this Swift package.


46
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,881 line:-1
Swift packages
not only make it easy


47
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,583 line:-1
to work with
Reality Composer Pro,


48
00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.652 line:-1 position:50%
but also during
the build process,


49
00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.520 line:-1 position:50%
it packages the content
into a framework


50
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.357 line:-1 position:50%
for our Xcode app to use.


51
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,725 line:-1
Let's take a look
at the structure


52
00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:08.128 line:-1 position:50%
of our Reality Composer Pro
project in Finder.


53
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.798 line:-1 position:50%
Notice here, the files we use
to edit 3D content are USDs,


54
00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:15.068 line:-1 position:50%
otherwise known as
Universal Scene Descriptions.


55
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:19,172 line:-1
This is Apple's preferred
file format for 3D content.


56
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,875 line:0
To learn more, check out
the WWDC sessions


57
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,278 position:50%
on the USD file format,
listed below.


58
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,849 line:0
When organizing files, any USD
placed in the .rkassets folder


59
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,784 line:0
will be compiled
into a framework,


60
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,720 position:50%
ready to use
in our Xcode project.


61
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.690 line:-1 position:50%
Going back to Xcode,
if we select the package,


62
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.993 line:-1 position:50%
a 3D preview
of the default scene appears.


63
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.462 line:-1 position:50%
If we want to investigate
or edit the scene further,


64
00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:46.099 line:-1 position:50%
all we need to do is click
Open in Reality Composer Pro.


65
00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.634 line:-1 position:50%
Now let's go over
how to navigate


66
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:52,806 line:-1
around Reality Composer Pro
and get a sense of the UI.


67
00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:56.510 line:-1 position:50%
In the center,
we have the viewport.


68
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,246 line:-1
The viewport allows us
to visualize, navigate through,


69
00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:01.615 line:-1 position:50%
and preview the 3D objects
in the scene.


70
00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:04.818 line:-1 position:50%
We support moving through the
viewport using W, A, S, D keys


71
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,686 line:-1
as well as the arrow keys.


72
00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.455 line:-1 position:50%
If we want even more control
of the viewport,


73
00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:10.757 line:-1 position:50%
we can plug in
a Mac-compatible game controller


74
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,060 line:-1
and fly through the viewport
that way.


75
00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:17.998 line:-1 position:50%
On the leading side,
we have the hierarchy panel.


76
00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:22.869 line:-1 position:50%
The hierarchy panel provides
an easy way to search, select,


77
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:27,374 line:-1
and organize the 3D objects
in the scene.


78
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,977 line:-1
On the trailing side,
we have the inspector panel.


79
00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:33.814 line:-1 position:50%
The inspector panel provides an
easy way to edit the properties


80
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,316 line:-1
of selected objects
such as the position,


81
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,318 line:-1
rotation, and scale.


82
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,090 line:-1
The Add Component button
on the bottom


83
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.625 line:-1 position:50%
of the inspector panel
also lets us view


84
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.893 line:-1 position:50%
the built-in
RealityKit Components


85
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,496 line:-1
that we can configure
on our objects.


86
00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:51.565 line:-1 position:50%
Below we have the editor panel.


87
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,001 line:-1
The first tab on the editor
panel is the Project Browser.


88
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.070 line:-1 position:50%
The Project Browser
is a user-friendly way


89
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.138 line:-1 position:50%
to navigate through the files


90
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:01,108 line:-1
included in the
Reality Composer Pro project.


91
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:04,144 line:-1
This panel also contains
other tabs for advanced editing:


92
00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:07.681 line:-1 position:50%
Shader Graph, Audio Mixer,
and Statistics.


93
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,483 line:-1
Now that we have the
Reality Composer Pro project


94
00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:12.085 line:-1 position:50%
set up and know how to navigate
around the UI,


95
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.087 line:-1 position:50%
let's start
composing a scene.


96
00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.589 line:-1 position:50%
There's three ways to add assets


97
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,025 line:-1
into a Reality Composer Pro
project.


98
00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.728 line:-1 position:50%
The first is importing assets
into the Project Browser


99
00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.498 line:-1 position:50%
that already exist
on your computer.


100
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:29,069 line:-1
Let's import the assets we plan
to use for our Dioramas app.


101
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,071 line:-1
We can do this by pressing
the import button


102
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,873 line:-1
in the Project Browser.


103
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:38,845 line:-1
Great! We have all our assets
in the Project Browser now.


104
00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.280 line:-1 position:50%
The second
is the Content Library,


105
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.948 line:-1 position:50%
which is a curated
library of assets


106
00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.850 line:-1 position:50%
provided by
Reality Composer Pro.


107
00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:47.187 line:-1 position:50%
The third is Object Capture,


108
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,390 line:-1
which turns photos of real-world
objects into 3D models.


109
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.458 line:-1 position:50%
To learn more, check out


110
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,996 line:-1
the "Meet Object Capture
for iOS" WWDC se  ssion.


111
00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:58.465 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we have our assets
imported into our project,


112
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,234 line:-1
let's get started
on building our scene.


113
00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.570 line:-1 position:50%
First let's delete the sphere
created by the template


114
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,472 line:-1
by selecting the object
in the viewport


115
00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.741 line:-1 position:50%
and hitting Delete.


116
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:10.510 line:-1 position:50%
In the Project Browser,
we have a 3D model of Yosemite


117
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,712 line:-1
and a nice diorama base
to hold it.


118
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,048 line:0
We'll drag these two assets
into the hierarchy panel,


119
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,651 position:50%
which adds references
to those assets in the scene.


120
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:20.187 line:-1 position:50%
The diorama base doesn't
seem to have a material.


121
00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:21.655 line:-1 position:50%
Let's check out
the Content Library


122
00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:25.492 line:-1 position:50%
and see if there's any materials
we would like to use.


123
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,060 line:-1
Let's click the plus button
in the toolbar


124
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.962 line:-1 position:50%
to open up the Content Library


125
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:33,333 line:-1
and look for a possible
material to use.


126
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,302 line:-1
This concrete material
looks promising,


127
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,070 line:-1
so we'll drag it into our scene.


128
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,239 line:-1
The asset is automatically
imported into our project


129
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,441 line:-1
and referenced in the scene.


130
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:43.843 line:-1 position:50%
Now let's select the diorama
base's material in the hierarchy


131
00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:47.013 line:-1 position:50%
and update it
to use the concrete material.


132
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:53,420 line:-1
Great! Next, placing
some location pins.


133
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,922 line:-1
We'll drag and drop a
location pin into the viewport


134
00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.857 line:-1 position:50%
and place it on El Capitan.


135
00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:03.830 line:-1 position:50%
Then duplicate the location pin
two more times,


136
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,299 line:-1
using Command-D,
and rename the three pins


137
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:10,103 line:-1
to El Capitan, Cathedral Rocks,
and Merced River.


138
00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:20.647 line:-1 position:50%
[KEYSTROKES]


139
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,383 line:-1
Let's move the Cathedral Rocks
and Merced River location pins


140
00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.785 line:-1 position:50%
to the right spots.


141
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:36,863 line:-1
Now that we have
the location pins


142
00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:39.499 line:-1 position:50%
in the right spots,
let's group the location pins


143
00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:40.967 line:-1 position:50%
for organizational purposes


144
00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:44.738 line:-1 position:50%
and rename the group,
"Yosemite_Location_Pins."


145
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.910 line:-1 position:50%
What if we want to update
the location pins


146
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,344 line:-1
to a newer version?


147
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,246 line:-1
Well, all these location pins
are referencing


148
00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.650 line:-1 position:50%
the location pin file
we previously imported.


149
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,518 line:-1
Leveraging the power of USD,


150
00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:01.221 line:-1 position:50%
if we ever wanted to update
the Location_Pin asset,


151
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:03.223 line:-1 position:50%
we can import a new Location_Pin
asset into our project


152
00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:06.793 line:-1 position:50%
and replace the existing one.


153
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:11.131 line:-1 position:50%
Now let's go over
particle emitters.


154
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,866 line:-1
Particle emitters allows us
to create effects


155
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,869 line:-1
such as this flame in our scene.


156
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,204 line:-1
A particle emitter
is composed of two parts:


157
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,507 line:-1
particles and an emitter.


158
00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:22.609 line:-1 position:50%
Both the particle and emitter
have multiple sections


159
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,712 line:-1
of variables
to tweak and modify.


160
00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.648 line:-1 position:50%
On the particle,
there's the color, properties,


161
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,785 line:-1
force fields,
and rendering sections.


162
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,187 line:0
On the emitter,
there's the timing, shape,


163
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,289 line:0
and spawning sections.


164
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,158 line:-1
Now let's add some clouds
using particle emitters


165
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,293 line:-1
to make our scene
more interesting and dynamic.


166
00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.361 line:-1 position:50%
How do we do that?


167
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:42.929 line:-1 position:50%
Well, our Reality Composer Pro
project


168
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,298 line:-1
can contain an arbitrary
amount of scenes.


169
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,133 line:-1
Scenes can represent
either a finished piece


170
00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:51.037 line:-1 position:50%
ready to use in our Xcode app,
or a reusable piece of content.


171
00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:54.507 line:-1 position:50%
In this case, clouds are made up
of smaller clouds.


172
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:58,878 line:-1
We'll first build a reusable
cloud chunk scene.


173
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,148 line:-1
Then we'll create a complete
cloud scene


174
00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.883 line:-1 position:50%
that combines multiple
cloud chunks


175
00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:06.186 line:-1 position:50%
placed at different positions
in 3D space.


176
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,088 position:50%
We'll make three
different variations


177
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,789 position:50%
of the complete clouds
and finally,


178
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,926 position:50%
put those three clouds
into our main scene.


179
00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:14.661 line:-1 position:50%
Jumping back into
Reality Composer Pro,


180
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:19.299 line:-1 position:50%
let's create a new scene by
going to File > New > Scene.


181
00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:23.370 line:-1 position:50%
We'll name the scene
"Cloud_Chunk".


182
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,771 line:-1
When a new scene is created,


183
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,607 line:-1
it appears as a new tab
in the window.


184
00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:30.677 line:-1 position:50%
There's two ways to add
particle emitters to the scene.


185
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,145 line:-1
The first is through
the plus button


186
00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:34.848 line:-1 position:50%
at the bottom
of the hierarchy panel.


187
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,883 line:-1
The second is adding
a Particle Emitter Component


188
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,084 line:-1
to any object in the scene


189
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,853 line:-1
by clicking
the Add Component button


190
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,822 line:-1
at the bottom
of the inspector panel.


191
00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:44.090 line:-1 position:50%
We can preview
the particle emitter


192
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,425 line:-1
by using the playback controls


193
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:48,361 line:-1
near the top
of the inspector panel.


194
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,463 line:-1
It's a little hard to see
so let's go to Settings


195
00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:52.098 line:-1 position:50%
and change
the viewport background


196
00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:55.869 line:-1 position:50%
to make the particle emitters
more visible.


197
00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:04.411 line:-1 position:50%
That's a lot better.


198
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,146 line:-1
Particles are really fun
to play with.


199
00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:07.781 line:-1 position:50%
I often get the results
I'm looking for


200
00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:10.383 line:-1 position:50%
just by experimenting with
properties here and there.


201
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,618 line:-1
There's no right
or wrong approach


202
00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:13.219 line:-1 position:50%
to making particle emitters,


203
00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.422 line:-1 position:50%
as long as you get them
to a state that pleases you.


204
00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:16.689 line:-1 position:50%
One thing to consider though


205
00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.525 line:-1 position:50%
is that a high count
of particles in a scene


206
00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:20.160 line:-1 position:50%
may have performance
implications,


207
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,162 line:-1
so I would recommend
paying close attention


208
00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:25.031 line:-1 position:50%
to the number of particles
being used.


209
00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:28.101 line:-1 position:50%
Now the particle emitter
component has two sections:


210
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,570 line:-1
particles and emitters.


211
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.704 line:-1 position:50%
In the particles section,


212
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,841 line:-1
we control the appearance
of the individual particles.


213
00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:35.975 line:-1 position:50%
In the emitters section,


214
00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:39.279 line:-1 position:50%
we control how the particles
come out of the origin location.


215
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,481 line:-1
There are also some presets
for us to build on top of.


216
00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:43.650 line:-1 position:50%
so we don't have to start
from scratch.


217
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,552 line:-1
The cloud is closest
to the Impact preset


218
00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:48.755 line:-1 position:50%
so let's select
the Impact preset to start.


219
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,989 line:-1
My typical workflow


220
00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.691 line:-1 position:50%
is first focusing
on the Emitters tab,


221
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:54.127 line:-1 position:50%
and then moving on
to the Particles tab.


222
00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:57.030 line:-1 position:50%
Looking at the Emitter tab,
Timing is the first section.


223
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.865 line:-1 position:50%
There's a slight pause
in between every emission


224
00:09:58,865 --> 00:09:59,966 line:-1
of particles.


225
00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:02.735 line:-1 position:50%
This is due to the
idle duration variable.


226
00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:03.636 line:-1 position:50%
Setting this to zero should give


227
00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:07.107 line:-1 position:50%
a constant emission
of particles.


228
00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.109 line:-1 position:50%
Moving on to the Shape section,


229
00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.644 line:-1 position:50%
clouds are more of a sphere
shape than a cylinder shape,


230
00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:14.414 line:-1 position:50%
so let's switch the emitter
shape to Sphere.


231
00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:17.150 line:-1 position:50%
Next, clouds should have
particles within its volume,


232
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,818 line:-1
so let's change
the birth location


233
00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:21.721 line:-1 position:50%
from Surface to Volume.


234
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,923 line:-1
Clouds also tend to be
more flat than tall,


235
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,025 line:-1
so let's adjust
the x- and z-axis scale


236
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,928 line:-1
to be greater
than the y-axis scale.


237
00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.831 line:-1 position:50%
That's looking great.


238
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,967 line:-1
Finally we should check
isLocalSpace


239
00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.102 line:-1 position:50%
so that future translating,
rotating, and scaling


240
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,637 line:-1
on the particle emitter's parent


241
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,273 line:-1
will also apply
to the particle emitter itself.


242
00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:41.875 line:-1 position:50%
Moving on to the Particles tab,


243
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,611 line:-1
we'll adjust the looks
of the individual particles.


244
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.412 line:-1 position:50%
The birth rate defines
the number of particles


245
00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:48.214 line:-1 position:50%
that exist at once.


246
00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:49.582 line:-1 position:50%
Being wary of performance,


247
00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:51.918 line:-1 position:50%
let's crank this down
from 2000 to 500


248
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:56,089 line:-1
and see if it
makes a difference.


249
00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:57.357 line:-1 position:50%
There's a slight change
in appearance,


250
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:01,127 line:-1
but it still looks pretty good,
so let's keep it at 500.


251
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,695 line:-1
Thanks to using
the Impact preset,


252
00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:04.631 line:-1 position:50%
the color and texture
of the particles


253
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,932 line:-1
are already what we want,


254
00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:08.501 line:-1 position:50%
so we can skip modifying
variables in those sections


255
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,437 line:-1
and move on
to the Properties section.


256
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,307 line:-1
The particles seem to exist
for too short of a time.


257
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,010 line:-1
Let's increase the life span
from two to five seconds


258
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.811 line:-1 position:50%
and see what happens.


259
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,716 line:-1
This looks great.


260
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,185 line:-1
There are more variables
we can play with


261
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,921 line:-1
in the Motion, Force Fields,
and Rendering sections,


262
00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:30.657 line:-1 position:50%
but the effect we have so far
is close to what we want,


263
00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:33.159 line:-1 position:50%
so let's not modify
those sections for now.


264
00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:35.662 line:-1 position:50%
We'll save the scene using
the shortcut Command-S


265
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:39,132 line:-1
and move on to the next step.


266
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,800 line:-1
Cool! We just built
our cloud chunk


267
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,068 line:-1
that we're going to reuse.


268
00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:43.603 line:-1 position:50%
Now let's create a new scene
that combines


269
00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:46.906 line:-1 position:50%
multiple cloud chunks
to make a complete cloud.


270
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,276 line:-1
We'll create a new scene
using the shortcut Command-N.


271
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,779 line:-1
Let's name this scene "Cloud_A."


272
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,749 line:-1
[KEYSTROKES]


273
00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:59.586 line:-1 position:50%
I'll reference
the cloud chunk three times


274
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,021 line:-1
by dragging the Cloud_Chunk
asset from the Project Browser


275
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,824 line:-1
into the hierarchy panel.


276
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,999 line:-1
We can select the parent
of these three cloud chunks


277
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,501 line:-1
and press play
in the playback controls


278
00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:17.036 line:-1 position:50%
at the top of the
inspector panel


279
00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:19.138 line:-1 position:50%
to preview the cloud.


280
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,674 line:-1
Now let's use the manipulator
to move these three cloud chunks


281
00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:24.110 line:-1 position:50%
to different positions
in 3D space.


282
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:34,053 line:-1
[CLICKING]


283
00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:42.662 line:-1 position:50%
Amazing.


284
00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:45.231 line:-1 position:50%
This looks like one cohesive
and complete cloud.


285
00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:48.635 line:-1 position:50%
We can save the scene
using Command-S again.


286
00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:50.637 line:-1 position:50%
In order to get
a nice variety of clouds,


287
00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:52.839 line:-1 position:50%
I made two more clouds
using a similar process


288
00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:56.542 line:-1 position:50%
to making Cloud_A but positioned
the cloud chunks differently.


289
00:12:56.542 --> 00:13:00.246 line:-1 position:50%
I named these scenes
Cloud_B and Cloud_C.


290
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,915 line:-1
Now let's jump back
into our main scene.


291
00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:05.318 line:-1 position:50%
I made a group called "Clouds"
and imported Cloud_A,


292
00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:08.554 line:-1 position:50%
Cloud_B, and Cloud_C
underneath this group.


293
00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:11.457 line:-1 position:50%
I also arranged them nicely
on top of our terrain.


294
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,326 line:-1
To preview
the particle emitters at once,


295
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,495 line:-1
all I have to do is click
the group "Clouds"


296
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,530 line:-1
and press play
on its playback controls


297
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,632 line:-1
at the top of the
inspector panel.


298
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.702 line:-1 position:50%
Awesome,
things are coming together.


299
00:13:22.702 --> 00:13:24.704 line:-1 position:50%
Next, let's go over
how to incorporate audio


300
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,039 line:-1
into our scenes.


301
00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:27.840 line:-1 position:50%
We can add audio
using audio files,


302
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.244 line:-1 position:50%
audio file groups,
and audio sources.


303
00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:34.047 line:-1 position:50%
Audio files imported into
a scene from the Project Browser


304
00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:35.748 line:-1 position:50%
can be configured
in various ways,


305
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,051 line:-1
such as if they should loop.


306
00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:40.586 line:-1 position:50%
An audio file can be played
on one or more objects,


307
00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:43.356 line:-1 position:50%
and an object can play
one or more audio files.


308
00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:49.195 line:-1 position:50%
An audio file group
can be constructed


309
00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:51.097 line:-1 position:50%
from audio files in a scene.


310
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,433 line:-1
Each time an object plays
an audio file group,


311
00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:57.370 line:-1 position:50%
a random audio file from the
group is selected for playback.


312
00:13:59.472 --> 00:14:01.641 line:-1 position:50%
An audio source defines
the way audio files


313
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:06,045 line:-1
and audio file groups
are emitted into a scene.


314
00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:08.014 line:-1 position:50%
There are three kinds
of audio sources:


315
00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:12.051 line:-1 position:50%
spatial, ambient, and channel.


316
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,320 line:-1
Spatial audio sources provide
a position and a direction


317
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.422 line:-1 position:50%
in 3D space
for the audio playing.


318
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,624 line:-1
Imagine using spatial audio
for a radio asset


319
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:22,128 line:-1
sitting on a table.


320
00:14:22.128 --> 00:14:23.996 line:-1 position:50%
Ambient audio sources
provide no position


321
00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:27.233 line:-1 position:50%
but a direction in 3D space
for the audio playing.


322
00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:29.135 line:-1 position:50%
Imagine using ambient audio
for wind sounds


323
00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:30.336 line:-1 position:50%
coming from the east,


324
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,472 line:-1
and no matter how far
we walk toward the east,


325
00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:36.776 line:-1 position:50%
the wind sounds will always
be coming from that direction.


326
00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:39.445 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, channel audio sources
provide neither a position


327
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,382 line:-1
nor a direction in 3D space
for the audio playing.


328
00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:44.150 line:-1 position:50%
Imagine using channel audio
for background music


329
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,185 line:-1
in an environment.


330
00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:47.987 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we've covered
the audio authoring concepts,


331
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,124 line:-1
let's see it in action
in our Dioramas project.


332
00:14:51.124 --> 00:14:53.025 line:-1 position:50%
We'll create a new scene
as a reusable asset


333
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,027 line:-1
that combines
a 3D model of a bird


334
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,431 line:-1
with audio files
and an audio source.


335
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:01.033 line:-1 position:50%
Command-N, and name this scene
"Bird_With_Audio."


336
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,603 line:-1
[KEYSTROKES]


337
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,173 line:-1
We previously imported
a bird with animation


338
00:15:07.173 --> 00:15:10.343 line:-1 position:50%
and two bird call audio files
into our Project Browser.


339
00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:12.745 line:-1 position:50%
Let's add those assets
as references into this scene


340
00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.615 line:-1 position:50%
by dragging them
into the hierarchy panel.


341
00:15:15.615 --> 00:15:17.216 line:-1 position:50%
Now any audio source
in the scene


342
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,052 line:-1
can utilize these two
bird call audio files.


343
00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:21.988 line:-1 position:50%
Next let's add
a spatial audio source


344
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:27,126 line:-1
by using the plus button at the
bottom of the hierarchy panel.


345
00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:28.828 line:-1 position:50%
We can also add
a spatial audio source


346
00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:30.263 line:-1 position:50%
to any object in the scene


347
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.031 line:-1 position:50%
by clicking
the Add Component button


348
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,733 line:-1
at the bottom
of the inspector panel,


349
00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:36.669 line:-1 position:50%
and selecting Spatial Audio
in the menu.


350
00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:39.806 line:-1 position:50%
Again, the Spatial Audio source
has a position and a direction,


351
00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:41.407 line:-1 position:50%
so we should place it near
the beak of the bird


352
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,811 line:-1
so it sounds more realistic.


353
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,880 line:-1
We can preview
the Spatial Audio source


354
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,284 line:-1
with the playback controls at
the top of the inspector panel.


355
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,024 line:-1
There's additional properties
on the spatial audio component


356
00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:00.993 line:-1 position:50%
we can adjust,
such as the focus


357
00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:03.996 line:-1 position:50%
and which bird call
audio file to preview.


358
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,368 line:-1
[BIRDS CALLS]


359
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,672 line:-1
Now what if we want
to randomly select


360
00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:14.340 line:-1 position:50%
one of these two bird calls
every time


361
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.676 line:-1 position:50%
the spatial audio source
is told to play?


362
00:16:16.676 --> 00:16:20.313 line:-1 position:50%
Well, that's what
audio file groups are for.


363
00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:21.848 line:-1 position:50%
We can create
audio file groups


364
00:16:21.848 --> 00:16:23.516 line:-1 position:50%
using the same plus button
at the bottom


365
00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:25.685 line:-1 position:50%
of the hierarchy panel.


366
00:16:25.685 --> 00:16:28.187 line:-1 position:50%
Let's drag in these audio files
into the audio file group


367
00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:30.423 line:-1 position:50%
and name the group "Bird_Calls."


368
00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:35.261 line:-1 position:50%
[KEYSTROKES]


369
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:41,267 line:-1
Now every time we preview
the Spatial Audio source,


370
00:16:41.267 --> 00:16:43.102 line:-1 position:50%
one of the bird calls within
the audio file group


371
00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:45.004 line:-1 position:50%
is randomly selected to play.


372
00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:46.706 line:-1 position:50%
[BIRD CALLS]


373
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,475 line:-1
[BIRD CALLS]


374
00:16:50.977 --> 00:16:54.113 line:-1 position:50%
[BIRD CALLS]


375
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,215 line:-1
Now that we've finished making
our reusable asset,


376
00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:59.118 line:-1 position:50%
let's save and close
this Bird_With_Audio scene


377
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,221 line:-1
and open back up our main scene.


378
00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:04.523 line:-1 position:50%
I arranged five references
of Birds_With_Audio


379
00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:07.727 line:-1 position:50%
in a V-shaped pattern
under a group called "Birds."


380
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,829 line:-1
We can select the group "Birds"


381
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,931 line:-1
and press the playback controls
in the inspector panel


382
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:14.400 line:-1 position:50%
to preview the animation
and audio for all the birds


383
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.501 line:-1 position:50%
at the same time.


384
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,005 line:-1
[LAYERED BIRD CALLS]


385
00:17:19.005 --> 00:17:22.174 line:-1 position:50%
Now that looks and sounds
pretty nice!


386
00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:23.276 line:-1 position:50%
Using this same procedure,


387
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,811 line:-1
I added the Forest_Sounds
audio file into our main scene,


388
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,146 line:-1
along with
an ambient audio source


389
00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:29.649 line:-1 position:50%
named "Nature _Ambience."


390
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,551 line:-1
To play audio in an Xcode app,
some additional code is needed,


391
00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:33.719 line:-1 position:50%
which will be covered in the


392
00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:38.324 line:-1 position:50%
"Work with Reality Composer Pro
content in Xcode" WWDC session.


393
00:17:38.324 --> 00:17:40.559 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we have the content
in our main scene set up,


394
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.662 line:-1 position:50%
let's go over
how to use statistics.


395
00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:45.464 line:-1 position:50%
Statistics is a dedicated editor
for helping us optimize


396
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,767 line:-1
the performance of a scene.


397
00:17:47.767 --> 00:17:50.770 line:-1 position:50%
The categories are split into
general, physics,


398
00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:54.440 line:-1 position:50%
animation, particle emitters,
audio, materials,


399
00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.342 line:-1 position:50%
geometry, and textures.


400
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:59,278 line:-1
Let's try out statistics
in our main scene.


401
00:17:59.278 --> 00:18:02.114 line:-1 position:50%
If we click on the Statistics
tab in the editor panel,


402
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,318 line:-1
the collection
of categories appears.


403
00:18:05.318 --> 00:18:06.385 line:-1 position:50%
The expand button


404
00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:08.087 line:-1 position:50%
on the top-right corner
of every category


405
00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:10.556 line:-1 position:50%
opens the category up
to a more detailed view.


406
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,125 line:0
Clicking on the expand button
for Geometry,


407
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,195 line:0
we see that there are roughly
464,000 triangles


408
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,597 line:0
used in the scene,
and the Diorama_Base


409
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:24,437 position:50%
uses the most amount
of triangles -- 256,000.


410
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,038 position:50%
We caught something here.


411
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,941 line:-1
The diorama base has a lot more
triangles than our 3D terrain,


412
00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:32.611 line:-1 position:50%
even though its visual shape is
less complex than our terrains.


413
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,580 line:-1
This is a great time
to simplify the geometry


414
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.383 line:-1 position:50%
of our diorama base
in a 3D modeling software.


415
00:18:37.383 --> 00:18:39.285 line:-1 position:50%
Luckily, my colleague
Scott Wade,


416
00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.487 line:-1 position:50%
who has created the assets
for our Dioramas app,


417
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,889 line:-1
has helped me with that.


418
00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:46.659 line:-1 position:50%
We can import the new simplified
version of our diorama's base


419
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:51,163 line:-1
into our project using the
Project Browser's import button.


420
00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:54.700 line:-1 position:50%
Select our new Diorama_Base,


421
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,405 line:-1
and replace the existing one.


422
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,706 line:-1
Now let's go back
to Statistics


423
00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:03.376 line:-1 position:50%
and take a look
at the Geometry category.


424
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:09,115 position:50%
The Diorama_Base now only
uses 2,500 triangles.


425
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,150 line:0
We reduced the number
of triangles in the scene


426
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,222 line:0
from 464,000 to 210,000—that's more than half!


427
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,857 line:-1
And our scene maintains
the same look


428
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,259 line:-1
prior to our change.


429
00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.628 line:-1 position:50%
As we just saw,
Statistics is a great tool


430
00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:26.032 line:-1 position:50%
to help optimize
the performance of a scene.


431
00:19:26.032 --> 00:19:27.366 line:-1 position:50%
There's one more thing.


432
00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:31.904 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a look at how we can
preview our scene on device.


433
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,573 line:-1
When we connect
our headset to the computer,


434
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,808 line:-1
select it in the dropdown


435
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,411 line:-1
next to the on-device preview
button in the toolbar,


436
00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:41.547 line:-1 position:50%
then toggle the
on-device preview button.


437
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,718 line:-1
We should see our scene appear
before our very eyes in AR.


438
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:48,854 line:-1
We can pinch and drag
to rotate the scene,


439
00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:52.892 line:-1 position:50%
and zoom to scale the scene.


440
00:19:52.892 --> 00:19:54.393 line:-1 position:50%
This makes it very easy
to get a sense


441
00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:56.095 line:-1 position:50%
of what our 3D content
looks like


442
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,697 line:-1
in the intended xrOS platform.


443
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,633 line:-1
In interest of time,
I performed similar steps


444
00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:02.368 line:-1 position:50%
of what we went through
in this session


445
00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:06.472 line:-1 position:50%
for another national park,
Catalina Island.


446
00:20:06.472 --> 00:20:09.442 line:-1 position:50%
Using this same workflow,
I added an additional 3D terrain


447
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,645 line:-1
of Catalina Island
to our main scene.


448
00:20:12.645 --> 00:20:15.915 line:-1 position:50%
I also added a few location
pins to mark Two Harbors,


449
00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:20.986 line:-1 position:50%
Parsons Landing, and
Ribbon Beach on Catalina Island.


450
00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:23.355 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, I added an
Ocean_Sounds audio file


451
00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:27.059 line:-1 position:50%
for the Nature_Ambience
audio source to use.


452
00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.394 line:-1 position:50%
What you saw today
is a walkthrough


453
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,862 line:-1
of Reality Composer Pro,


454
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,631 line:-1
a powerful tool to help you
assemble 3D scenes.


455
00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:34.400 line:-1 position:50%
You can add interesting
RealityKit Components,


456
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,570 line:-1
such as particle emitters
and audio sources.


457
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.971 line:-1 position:50%
It also helps you
optimize your scene


458
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,373 line:-1
and preview it on headset.


459
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,309 position:50%
To learn more about how
you can use the Shader Graph


460
