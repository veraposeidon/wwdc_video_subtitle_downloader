Allen: Hello, everyone!


4
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,281 line:-2
I'm Allen,
an engineer on the accessibility team,


5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:18,452 line:-2
and welcome
to "Meet Assistive Access" at WWDC.


6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,154 line:-1
At Apple, we strive to ensure


7
00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:25.626 line:-2 align:center
our products are accessible
and inclusive to everyone.


8
00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:29.263 line:-2 align:center
We understand that cognitive disabilities
can present their own unique set


9
00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:33.367 line:-2 align:center
of challenges in how people interact
with our technology.


10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.005 line:-2 align:center
Assistive Access is a mode that distills
apps and experiences to their core


11
00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.742 line:-2 align:center
to lighten cognitive load
for people with disabilities.


12
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,611 line:-2
With the help of a trusted supporter,
for example,


13
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,015 line:-1
a parent, guardian, or conservator,


14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,817 line:-2
customizations
in Assistive Access' settings


15
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:54.688 line:-2 align:center
will make it easy to navigate
and use apps with greater independence


16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,457 line:-1
than before on iPhone and iPad.


17
00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:02.162 line:-2 align:center
Today, we'll discover how to set up
and turn on Assistive Access,


18
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,965 line:-1
as well as explore how it works.


19
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:10,637 line:-2
Next, we'll explore some of the goals
and core values of Assistive Access.


20
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:15.309 line:-2 align:center
We'll discuss how your application will
behave when Assistive Access is turned on.


21
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,345 line:-2
And finally, we'll discuss
additional things to consider


22
00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:21.648 line:-2 align:center
about your app's presentation
in Assistive Access.


23
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:25,352 line:-1
With that, let's get started.


24
00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.121 line:-1 align:center
Setting up Assistive Access is simple.


25
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:31,525 line:-2
As mentioned, trusted supporters
can use the Settings app


26
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:36,430 line:-2
to customize Assistive Access to the needs
of the person using the device.


27
00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:39.299 line:-2 align:center
When first accessing this mode
through settings,


28
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:43.437 line:-2 align:center
trusted supporters will be guided
through the initial setup process.


29
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.840 line:-2 align:center
They'll be able to customize many aspects
of Assistive Access,


30
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:49,776 line:-2
from choosing the preferred apps
that will be allowed to run


31
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,480 line:-2
to choosing
whether the battery indicator is present.


32
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,316 line:-2
Assistive Access can be
turned on from its settings


33
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,287 line:-1
or by using the accessibility shortcut.


34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,758 line:-2
Once entering into Assistive Access,
the system displays a new lock screen


35
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.995 line:-2 align:center
with the capability
to change its wallpaper in settings


36
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:11,598 line:-2
and an interface
to inform people of notifications.


37
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,670 line:-2
Navigating past the Lock screen,
a new Home screen is displayed


38
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,840 line:-1
with larger app icons and larger text.


39
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,179 line:-2
I've set up Assistive Access
to include five Apple apps


40
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:29,583 line:-1
designed specifically for this mode:


41
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:34,955 line:-2
“Calls” to make or receive calls
from friends and family,


42
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,927 line:-1
“Messages” to send and receive messages,


43
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.232 line:-2 align:center
“Music” to have access
to favorite playlists,


44
00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:51.038 line:-2 align:center
“Camera” to take pictures,
videos, and selfies,


45
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:55.943 line:-2 align:center
and “Photos”
to view saved photos and videos.


46
00:02:55.976 --> 00:03:00.747 line:-2 align:center
Assistive Access is crafted with a set
of design and development objectives


47
00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:05.652 line:-2 align:center
aimed at creating an effective experience
to reduce cognitive strain.


48
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:09,957 line:-2
Many apps on iOS and iPadOS
have plenty of user interface items,


49
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,561 line:-2
including buttons,
icons, menus, images, and more.


50
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,731 line:-2
For some people,
this level of functionality


51
00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:20.834 line:-2 align:center
and completeness
can become a challenge to operate.


52
00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:24.771 line:-2 align:center
People should be able
to complete a task without distractions.


53
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,975 line:-2
Assistive Access
reduces the available options,


54
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:32,746 line:-2
so people can find and navigate
to their items of interest.


55
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,882 line:-1
Fewer steps and fewer options


56
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:39,086 line:-2
can help provide a clear path
to success in completing a task.


57
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,424 line:-2
Recognizing and recovering
from errors can be difficult.


58
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:49,263 line:-2
When people encounter significant actions,
such as deleting a file,


59
00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:52.699 line:-2 align:center
they should be given clear instructions
and given the opportunity


60
00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:56.970 line:-2 align:center
to understand what
is happening before continuing.


61
00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:00.574 line:-2 align:center
This also includes reducing actions
that are time-dependent


62
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,378 line:-1
and make it easy to go back at any time.


63
00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.115 line:-2 align:center
Creating
familiar interactions and patterns


64
00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:11.218 line:-1 align:center
is crucial to Assistive Access.


65
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,721 line:-2
It establishes a sense
of predictability and comfort,


66
00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:18.025 line:-2 align:center
while also engaging
in a multi-modal experience,


67
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,361 line:-1
like seeing both text and images.


68
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:25,632 line:-2
This helps reduce cognitive strain,
makes the interface familiar,


69
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,636 line:-2
and increases the chance
the interface will be understood.


70
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,874 line:-2
By reducing complexity,
helping people prevent errors,


71
00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:36.310 line:-1 align:center
and creating familiar interactions,


72
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:40,614 line:-2
people can use iPhone and iPad
with less difficulty.


73
00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:43.550 line:-2 align:center
Now, let's take a look
at how your app will behave


74
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:46,086 line:-1
when Assistive Access is turned on.


75
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,624 line:-2
In Assistive Access,
third party apps will just work.


76
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:54,962 line:-2
In this setup, I've added my app.
Let's see how it looks.


77
00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:59.666 line:-2 align:center
When I open my app, Assistive Access
adds the large back button


78
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,402 line:-2
displayed prominently
at the bottom of the screen.


79
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,439 line:-1
To make room for the back button,


80
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,109 line:-2
apps are displayed
in a reduced frame by default.


81
00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.678 line:-2 align:center
This is to ensure
your app still looks great,


82
00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:16.650 line:-2 align:center
in case you've designed your app based
on individual device screen size.


83
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,853 line:-2
In addition,
navigating back to the home screen


84
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:23,056 line:-1
can be done by tapping on the back button.


85
00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:26.660 line:-2 align:center
Some apps
are designed specifically to be adaptive


86
00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:29.563 line:-1 align:center
to varying devices and screen sizes.


87
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:33,700 line:-2
We've created a new info.plist key
that will allow your apps to run


88
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,303 line:-1
in full screen, excluding the back button.


89
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,408 line:-1
Add UISupportsFullScreenInAssistiveAccess


90
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,479 line:-2
to your info.plist file
and set its value to yes.


91
00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:49.516 line:-2 align:center
Use this key to let Assistive Access know
you've designed your app


92
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,886 line:-1
to be adaptive to arbitrary screen sizes.


93
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,357 line:-2
My app has be designed for my audience
and to have an adaptive layout,


94
00:05:57.391 --> 00:05:59.993 line:-1 align:center
so this key is relevant to my app.


95
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,497 line:-2
Let's take a look at how my app
behaves after adding this key.


96
00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:08.302 line:-2 align:center
Great, my app uses all
of the available space


97
00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:10.070 line:-1 align:center
in Assistive Access.


98
00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:14.107 line:-2 align:center
Let's look at ways to ensure
your app can do the same.


99
00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:18.078 line:-2 align:center
Great apps on iPhone and iPad
are designed to have a consistent layout


100
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.181 line:-2 align:center
that adapts
regardless of your user's device.


101
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:24,318 line:-2
This means that your app
does not hard code layout


102
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,987 line:-1
based on the device or screen size.


103
00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:32.693 line:-2 align:center
In SwiftUI, developers can
take advantage of layout containers,


104
00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.696 line:-2 align:center
such as Stacks and Grids,
to arrange views,


105
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,600 line:-2
as well as layout modifiers
to adjust or constrain the size,


106
00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:42.936 line:-3 align:center
position, and alignment of a view.


107
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,806 line:-4
If you need
a more customized layout for your app,


108
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,077 line:-4
check out the session
"Compose custom layouts with SwiftUI."


109
00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:56.717 line:-2 align:center
In UIKit, we can use AutoLayout and take
advantage of two important features.


110
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.621 line:-2 align:center
The first is the Safe Area,
which is the portion of the screen


111
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:04,191 line:-2
that is not obstructed by system
hardware or software elements,


112
00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:08.762 line:-2 align:center
such as the Dynamic Island
or the Home indicator.


113
00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:12.266 line:-2 align:center
Use the safeAreaInsets property
to position your views


114
00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:14.902 line:-2 align:center
within the visible portion
of the interface.


115
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:19,740 line:-2
Layout Guide is the second feature,
which defines a rectangular region


116
00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:24.411 line:-2 align:center
that helps you position
and align your content on screen.


117
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,248 line:-2
Use the safeAreaLayoutGuide property
to adjust elements


118
00:07:28.282 --> 00:07:31.218 line:-1 align:center
and apply standard margins around content.


119
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,088 line:-4
To learn more
about making your apps adaptive,


120
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:40,060 line:-4
check out the session
"UIKit: Apps for Every Size and Shape."


121
00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:45.499 line:-2 align:center
Whether using SwiftUI or UIKit,
this new Info.plist key,


122
00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:48.735 line:-2 align:center
along with an adaptive layout,
can ensure all users


123
00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:52.639 line:-2 align:center
in Assistive Access have
a great experience in your app.


124
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:57,277 line:-2
Let's make sure
everyone can enjoy and use your app,


125
00:07:57.311 --> 00:07:59.346 line:-1 align:center
even in Assistive Access.


126
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,782 line:-1
Thanks for watching.
