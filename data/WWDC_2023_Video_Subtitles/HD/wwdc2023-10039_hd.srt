Melissa: Hi, I’m Melissa Nierle.


4
00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.480 line:-1 align:center
I’m a software engineer


5
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:16,350 line:-2
on the Enterprise and Education
Technologies team,


6
00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:21.154 line:-2 align:center
and today I’m excited to introduce you
to device management for Apple Watch.


7
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:25,058 line:-2
Apple Watch has become
an indispensable daily companion for users


8
00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.929 line:-2 align:center
by helping us stay connected,
active, and healthy.


9
00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:33.166 line:-2 align:center
Hands-free communication,
responding to notifications on the go,


10
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.536 line:-1 align:center
and safety features like fall detection


11
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,773 line:-2
make Apple Watch the perfect addition
for enterprise customers.


12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,376 line:-1
From small businesses and public utilities


13
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,145 line:-2
to large enterprises
and healthcare systems,


14
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:49,550 line:-2
there’s no limit to the places
where you’ll find Apple Watch at work.


15
00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:52.186 line:-2 align:center
Companies like Volvo
already use Apple Watch


16
00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.288 line:-1 align:center
to enhance their employee workflow


17
00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:59.193 line:-2 align:center
by using it to log jobs and streamline
communication with customers.


18
00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:04.064 line:-2 align:center
We want to enable organizations to create
solutions that improve productivity,


19
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,667 line:-2
support wellness,
and provide additional safety


20
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.570 line:-2 align:center
by deploying Apple Watch
to their employees.


21
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:15,108 line:-2
That’s why this year, we’re introducing
Device Management for watchOS.


22
00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.445 line:-2 align:center
Organizations can now deploy
and configure Apple Watches


23
00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:21.248 line:-1 align:center
along with all their other Apple devices.


24
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:24,418 line:-2
We’re excited to see all the ways
Apple Watch will impact


25
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:28,188 line:-2
both users and their organizations
when deployed at scale.


26
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,691 line:-1
Let’s get started with how it works.


27
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:35,362 line:-2
First, we’ll discuss the new enrollment
flow for Apple Watch, and then later,


28
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,832 line:-2
we’ll talk about what you need
to know when managing Apple Watch.


29
00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.103 line:-2 align:center
There are a few things we should consider
when Apple Watch enrolls into MDM.


30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,275 line:-2
First, just like how we use
Apple Watch and iPhone together as a pair,


31
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:51,645 line:-2
they are managed together
as a pair as well.


32
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:56,617 line:-2
The devices share functionality between
them like apps and restrictions,


33
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,952 line:-2
as well as hand off information
to each other


34
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:02,456 line:-1
to perform tasks in one seamless flow.


35
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:06,760 line:-2
We’ve leveraged this to create
the Apple Watch enrollment flow.


36
00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:09.162 line:-2 align:center
The enrollment flow
actually begins on iPhone


37
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,534 line:-2
for both the organization administrator
and the end user.


38
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.870 line:-2 align:center
The host iPhone will need
to already be enrolled with MDM,


39
00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:21.241 line:-2 align:center
and supervised in order to perform
the watch enrollment flow.


40
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,511 line:-2
MDM enrollment happens
during the watch pairing flow,


41
00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:29.049 line:-2 align:center
so you will need to begin
with a new or reset Apple Watch.


42
00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:34.655 line:-2 align:center
Existing paired Apple Watches will need
to be reset in order to be enrolled.


43
00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:38.892 line:-2 align:center
The Apple Watch enrollment flow
utilizes declarative device management


44
00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.428 line:-2 align:center
so your server will need
to support both Apple Watch


45
00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:45.332 line:-2 align:center
and Declarative Device Management
to enroll Apple Watch.


46
00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.168 line:-2 align:center
Check out what’s new this year
in declarative device management


47
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,571 line:-1
by checking out its session.


48
00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:54.041 line:-2 align:center
Now that we know the prerequisites,
let's dive into the enrollment flow


49
00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.642 line:-1 align:center
step by step.


50
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,979 line:-2
We start with a managed
and supervised iPhone.


51
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:04,985 line:-2
First, the organization administrator
will send a new declaration to the phone.


52
00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:07.955 line:-2 align:center
This is the new
Watch Enrollment configuration.


53
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,491 line:-2
It signifies to the iPhone
that any Apple Watch that pairs to it


54
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,628 line:-1
should be enrolled into MDM.


55
00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.331 line:-1 align:center
Here is the content of that configuration.


56
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,100 line:-1
Let's take a look at the payload keys.


57
00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:23.136 line:-2 align:center
First is the key
for the enrollment URL endpoint.


58
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.506 line:-1 align:center
This endpoint delivers the MDM profile


59
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,642 line:-2
that the Apple Watch will download
and install.


60
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,247 line:-2
The MDM profile for Apple Watch
is just like the MDM profiles already used


61
00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.682 line:-1 align:center
for iOS and macOS devices.


62
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,620 line:-2
The next key,
AnchorCertificateAssetReferences,


63
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:44,024 line:-2
is an optional item and specifies
an array of anchor certificates.


64
00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.727 line:-2 align:center
These anchor certs will
be used to evaluate the trust


65
00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:49.396 line:-1 align:center
of the enrollment profile server.


66
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,766 line:-2
Each anchor certificate used
in this flow must be included


67
00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:57.104 line:-2 align:center
in an asset declaration
already present on the iPhone.


68
00:03:57.171 --> 00:04:02.276 line:-2 align:center
Now that the configuration is installed,
let’s bring in Apple Watch.


69
00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:05.445 line:-2 align:center
Like I mentioned, the Apple Watch
will be in its pairing state,


70
00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:08.916 line:-2 align:center
and once
the user initiates pairing from the phone,


71
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,985 line:-2
they will be prompted
to accept Remote Management.


72
00:04:12.052 --> 00:04:14.821 line:-2 align:center
Here. the user will need
to allow remote management


73
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,790 line:-1
for their Watch to continue.


74
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,825 line:-1
If they don’t accept remote management,


75
00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:22.196 line:-2 align:center
the pairing flow will end
without the Watch getting set up.


76
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:26.033 line:-2 align:center
The enrollment flow for Apple Watch
is designed with security in mind


77
00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.604 line:-2 align:center
to address the need to manage iPhone
and Apple Watch together as a pair.


78
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,874 line:-2
There are two key pieces
to ensure security.


79
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,244 line:-2
First, the administrator needs
to verify that the host iPhone


80
00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:42.149 line:-2 align:center
is enrolled into an MDM server
managed by their organization.


81
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:46,553 line:-2
Secondly, they need to be able to identity
which iPhones and Apple Watches


82
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.955 line:-1 align:center
are paired together.


83
00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:51.725 line:-2 align:center
Let’s see how we accomplish
that with this new enrollment flow.


84
00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:55.629 line:-2 align:center
During Watch pairing,
the iPhone sends information


85
00:04:55,696 --> 00:05:00,033 line:-2
from its Watch enrollment configuration
to the Apple Watch.


86
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.937 line:-2 align:center
The Apple Watch uses the URL
and any provided anchor certificates


87
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,140 line:-1
to make initial contact with the server.


88
00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:11.879 line:-2 align:center
Within this request,
it will provide signed machine info.


89
00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:14.982 line:-2 align:center
Upon receiving the enrollment request
from the Apple Watch,


90
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,051 line:-2
the server will inspect
the machine info data


91
00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:21.822 line:-1 align:center
and look for a new "pairing token" key.


92
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,792 line:-2
Because the pairing token key
will not be present on this first attempt,


93
00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:30.063 line:-2 align:center
the server will issue
an HTTP 403 response.


94
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.166 line:-2 align:center
Here’s what that 403 response
will look like.


95
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,002 line:-1
First, the error code tells us


96
00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:38.872 line:-2 align:center
that the Watch pairing token is missing
from the request.


97
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,810 line:-2
Then, within the details dictionary,
you will provide a security-token.


98
00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:47.681 line:-2 align:center
This random UUID string
will be used by the Watch


99
00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:50.918 line:-2 align:center
to kick off the pairing token
retrieval flow.


100
00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:55.556 line:-2 align:center
The Watch sends
this security-token to the iPhone.


101
00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:58.358 line:-2 align:center
The iPhone performs
a GetToken checkIn request,


102
00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:01.795 line:-2 align:center
which includes
both the phone and Watch UDID,


103
00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:06.700 line:-2 align:center
as well as the security token received
from the Watch’s MDM server.


104
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,670 line:-2
Here’s what this
new checkin request looks like.


105
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,173 line:-2
We’ve added a new CheckIn message type
this year called the “get token”


106
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.608 line:-1 align:center
check in request.


107
00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:18.612 line:-2 align:center
This new message type allows
the device to request secure tokens


108
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:22,382 line:-2
for various services
the MDM server supports.


109
00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.585 line:-1 align:center
The TokenServiceType key indicates


110
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:27,821 line:-2
which service
we are requesting a token for.


111
00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:32.392 line:-2 align:center
Here, the value indicates
it needs a Watch pairing token.


112
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,329 line:-2
Next, the TokenParameters key
is a dictionary


113
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.866 line:-2 align:center
containing parameters specific
to the token service type.


114
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,903 line:-2
For the Watch pairing token,
the phone includes the security token


115
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:49,076 line:-2
from the Watch, its own UDID,
and the Apple Watch’s UDID.


116
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,278 line:-1
The MDM server takes this information


117
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:54,448 line:-2
and uses it to generate
a secure pairing token


118
00:06:54.515 --> 00:06:58.886 line:-2 align:center
that can be verified by the Apple Watch’s
MDM server upon receipt.


119
00:06:58.952 --> 00:07:02.456 line:-2 align:center
Here, the MDM server can create
the correct relationship


120
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:07,895 line:-2
between the iPhone and Apple Watch
based on the received UDIDs.


121
00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:12.866 line:-2 align:center
The server finishes by sending
its generated pairing token to the iPhone.


122
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:17,171 line:-2
Here’s an example of what that token
response from the server will look like.


123
00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:21.308 line:-2 align:center
The token is in
the form of base64 encoded data.


124
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:26,480 line:-2
Upon receipt, the phone sends
the pairing token to the Apple Watch.


125
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:30,150 line:-2
The pairing token is then added
into the Watch’s Machine Info,


126
00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:34.855 line:-2 align:center
and sent back to the MDM server
in a new enrollment request.


127
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,291 line:-2
Here’s an example of
the Apple Watch machine info


128
00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:41.695 line:-2 align:center
sent to the server with
the secure pairing token included.


129
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:45,566 line:-2
The MDM server securely verifies
the pairing token it received


130
00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:49.269 line:-2 align:center
with the machine info,
and can therefore confirm the identity


131
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,238 line:-1
of the iPhone’s MDM server


132
00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:55.375 line:-2 align:center
and the paired relationship
between the iPhone and Apple Watch.


133
00:07:55.442 --> 00:08:00.180 line:-2 align:center
Now the server returns the MDM
enrollment profile to the Apple Watch.


134
00:08:00.247 --> 00:08:04.718 line:-2 align:center
The user will finish the steps on
the phone to complete Apple Watch setup,


135
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,921 line:-2
and the Enrollment profile
will be installed on the Apple Watch


136
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:10.324 line:-1 align:center
at the end of the pairing flow.


137
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,493 line:-2
Just like on iOS,
enrollment is officially complete


138
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.831 line:-2 align:center
when the Apple Watch sends a CheckIn
request with the Authenticate messageType.


139
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:21,335 line:-2
And now Apple Watch
is enrolled and supervised!


140
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,637 line:-1
With this specialized enrollment flow,


141
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:26,607 line:-2
you will want to keep a few things in mind
for Apple Watch.


142
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,644 line:-2
First, when building
your device management solution,


143
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:34.047 line:-2 align:center
utilize the data sent
to the server during enrollment


144
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:38,018 line:-2
to detect which Apple Watch
is paired to which iPhone.


145
00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:40.554 line:-2 align:center
Use this information
to create an intuitive UI


146
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:45,292 line:-2
for IT administrators
who will need to identify the pairs.


147
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,928 line:-2
Keep in mind that once
the Watch Enrollment configuration


148
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:51,698 line:-2
is applied to the phone,
all Apple Watches that begin to pair


149
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:55,669 line:-2
with the phone will be prompted
to enroll into management.


150
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:58,805 line:-2
However, any Apple Watches
already paired to the phone


151
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:01.608 line:-2 align:center
will not be affected
and would need to be wiped


152
00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:05.112 line:-1 align:center
and paired again in order to be enrolled.


153
00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:09.216 line:-2 align:center
And lastly, remember that Apple Watch
is supervised once its enrolled,


154
00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:13.420 line:-2 align:center
so you can add it to all of your workflows
for organization owned devices.


155
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,922 line:-1
And just like with iOS,


156
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:20,294 line:-2
health information and fitness activity
is never sent to the MDM server.


157
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.296 line:-2 align:center
Now that we know
how to enroll Apple Watch,


158
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,498 line:-1
let’s talk about how you’ll manage it.


159
00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:26.433 line:-1 align:center
We are starting right out of the gate


160
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.137 line:-2 align:center
with declarative device management support
for watchOS.


161
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:34,808 line:-2
In watchOS 10, all declaration types
are supported on watchOS.


162
00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:38.812 line:-2 align:center
Predicates in activation declarations
are supported as well,


163
00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:43.217 line:-2 align:center
so you can build custom multi-step
management workflows right on the Watch.


164
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,486 line:-2
The status channel has also
made its way to Apple Watch,


165
00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:51.792 line:-2 align:center
so you will be able to receive proactive
updates from all of your Apple devices.


166
00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:56.263 line:-2 align:center
Here’s a look at the declarative
device management features in watchOS 10.


167
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.966 line:-2 align:center
Find the full list of support
in our open source schema


168
00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:00.634 line:-1 align:center
and developer documentation


169
00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:05.239 line:-2 align:center
that has been updated
to reflect availability on watchOS.


170
00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:09.610 line:-2 align:center
Of course, the MDM protocol
is also supported on managed watches.


171
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:13,313 line:-2
Payloads, restrictions, and MDM commands
and queries


172
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.382 line:-1 align:center
can all be sent to the Apple Watch,


173
00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:19.453 line:-2 align:center
just as you do today
for your other Apple devices.


174
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,524 line:-2
There’s a wide range of supported
MDM features for watchOS this year.


175
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.194 line:-2 align:center
Let’s talk about a few of
the available configuration payloads.


176
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:31,265 line:-2
First we have our suite
of networking capabilities.


177
00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:35.469 line:-2 align:center
New this year in watchOS 10
is the ability to have a dedicated VPN


178
00:10:35.536 --> 00:10:37.571 line:-1 align:center
installed on Apple Watch.


179
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,274 line:-2
In addition to our existing
networking payloads,


180
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.708 line:-1 align:center
Wi-Fi and Cellular,


181
00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:46.213 line:-2 align:center
we’ve also brought support
for the per-app VPN payload to watchOS.


182
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:52,319 line:-2
Now you can equip all your Apple devices
with access to your secure enterprise VPN.


183
00:10:52.386 --> 00:10:57.224 line:-2 align:center
Next, let's talk about the payloads
you can use to ensure security on watchOS.


184
00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:01.862 line:-2 align:center
The same payloads you already use
to install SCEP and ACME certificates,


185
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:06,166 line:-2
enforce passcode rules, and
apply restrictions on your Apple devices


186
00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:08.802 line:-1 align:center
are now all supported for watchOS.


187
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,638 line:-2
The password policy
and restrictions payloads


188
00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:14.675 line:-1 align:center
both share unique behavior on watchOS.


189
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,244 line:-1
Let’s cover that now.


190
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:20,180 line:-2
Restrictions and passcode rules
that are applied to iPhone


191
00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:22.716 line:-1 align:center
will be synced to the paired Apple Watch.


192
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:27,821 line:-2
For example, if you apply a passcode
enforcement policy to the iPhone,


193
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,023 line:-2
the paired managed Watch
will prompt the user


194
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,160 line:-1
to create a passcode for it as well.


195
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:38,198 line:-2
If an alphanumeric password
is required by the iPhone’s policy,


196
00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:42.503 line:-2 align:center
the user will need to use their iPhone
in order to unlock their Apple Watch,


197
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:46,607 line:-2
Like, for instance,
when it's taken off their wrist.


198
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:50,010 line:-2
However, both Restriction payloads
and password payloads applied


199
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:54,248 line:-2
directly to Apple Watch will
not be synced back to iPhone.


200
00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:57.150 line:-2 align:center
Use this detail in the directionality
of the rules


201
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,952 line:-1
to customize your restrictions


202
00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:02.256 line:-2 align:center
and password policy payloads
for each platform.


203
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,526 line:-2
MDM queries are helpful
to learn the current status


204
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,728 line:-1
of the device and its content.


205
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,898 line:-2
These queries, of course,
operate in a polling manner,


206
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,066 line:-1
from the server to the device.


207
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,270 line:-2
Instead of constantly
polling the Apple Watch with queries,


208
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,641 line:-2
you should instead use the status channel
of declarative device management.


209
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,510 line:-2
This way, the Apple Watch
proactively tells the server


210
00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:28.415 line:-2 align:center
whenever a change occurs
to a status item the server subscribes to.


211
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:32,853 line:-2
Now, let's turn to commands that
you'll want to consider for watchOS.


212
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.556 line:-2 align:center
The same commands from iOS
are supported on watchOS


213
00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:39.826 line:-2 align:center
to ensure the integrity of the enterprise
data on your Apple Watch.


214
00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:44.798 line:-2 align:center
You can remotely clear the passcode,
lock and erase the device as needed.


215
00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:48.435 line:-2 align:center
Un-enrolling from MDM by removing
the profile is also supported


216
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:52,439 line:-2
for watchOS,
but it has different on-device behavior.


217
00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:54.641 line:-1 align:center
Let’s look at that now.


218
00:12:54,708 --> 00:13:00,147 line:-2
Removing the MDM profile from Apple Watch,
whether by a user or via MDM command,


219
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:03,884 line:-2
causes it to be unenrolled
from the server.


220
00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:08.155 line:-2 align:center
When Apple Watch is unenrolled,
it is unpaired from its host iPhone


221
00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:12.025 line:-2 align:center
and its content and settings
are all erased.


222
00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:17.931 line:-2 align:center
Un-enrolling Apple Watch will not effect
the enrollment status of its host iPhone.


223
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,401 line:-2
Now, if the host iPhone
becomes unenrolled,


224
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,338 line:-1
whether by the user or the organization,


225
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,808 line:-2
it will trigger the Watch
to be unenrolled as well.


226
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,011 line:-2
Therefore, removing management
from the host iPhone


227
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:36,517 line:-2
will ultimately result in the managed
Apple Watch being unpaired and reset.


228
00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:41.922 line:-2 align:center
The last piece of the MDM protocol
we will want to discuss is app deployment.


229
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:45,459 line:-2
On watchOS, there are
three different kinds of apps.


230
00:13:45.526 --> 00:13:48.161 line:-2 align:center
First, there are Paired apps,
which are watch apps


231
00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:52.165 line:-2 align:center
that share data between itself
and its complementary iPhone app,


232
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:57,204 line:-2
but the Watch app can function on its own
in the absence of the iPhone app.


233
00:13:57.271 --> 00:14:00.207 line:-1 align:center
Next, there are dependent watchOS apps.


234
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:05,979 line:-2
These Apple Watch apps require
a companion iPhone app to be functional.


235
00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:08.916 line:-2 align:center
And lastly,
there are Standalone watchOS apps.


236
00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:14.087 line:-2 align:center
These apps exist only on the watchOS
platform and have no iOS companion app.


237
00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:16.890 line:-2 align:center
For both the Paired
and Dependent watchOS app types,


238
00:14:16.957 --> 00:14:21.995 line:-2 align:center
administrators will need to manage these
apps together across the two devices.


239
00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:25.065 line:-2 align:center
Standalone watchOS apps
are also supported.


240
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:29,937 line:-2
These apps will only need the App Install
command sent to the Apple Watch.


241
00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:33.941 line:-2 align:center
When installing paired and dependent apps
to iPhone and Apple Watch,


242
00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:37.511 line:-2 align:center
the app should
be installed to the iPhone first.


243
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:40,347 line:-2
Then, once you ensure
the app installed on iPhone,


244
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:43,684 line:-2
send the install app command
to Apple Watch.


245
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.387 line:-2 align:center
When updating Paired
or Dependent watchOS app types,


246
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:52,893 line:-2
both the phone and the Watch app will need
to be sent commands to update their apps.


247
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.396 line:-2 align:center
Similarly,
when deleting paired or dependent apps,


248
00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:59.099 line:-2 align:center
the remove command will need
to be sent to both Apple Watch


249
00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:02.302 line:-2 align:center
and iPhone in order
to ensure correct behavior.


250
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:06,707 line:-2
Managing paired and dependent iPhone
and Apple Watch apps in tandem like this


251
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:11,545 line:-2
will make for the best user experience and
the smoothest workflow for administrators


252
00:15:11.612 --> 00:15:15.649 line:-2 align:center
because it ensures apps are
available and properly managed.


253
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:18,385 line:-2
That’s just a small glimpse
of all the things you can do


254
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,320 line:-1
with managing Apple Watch.


255
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:24,258 line:-2
Understanding these best practices
we’ve gone over is the best way to ensure


256
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:28,228 line:-2
a smooth adoption and ramp up
of your watchOS management.


257
00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:31.732 line:-2 align:center
Let's summarize some of the key points
now.


258
00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:36.203 line:-2 align:center
Administrators will need to manage iPhones
and watchOS together as a pair,


259
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:40.140 line:-2 align:center
so make sure your MDM products
are built with this relationship in mind.


260
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:44,878 line:-2
Creating combined workflows and exposing
the device relationships in your UI


261
00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:49.950 line:-2 align:center
will help admins keep
the two platforms in sync with each other.


262
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,452 line:-2
Take advantage
of the proactive status channel


263
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,623 line:-2
built into Declarative Device Management
to avoid constantly polling the device


264
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,960 line:-2
for information,
which could be a drain on power.


265
00:16:00.027 --> 00:16:03.030 line:-2 align:center
The Declarative Device Management
status channel will update the server


266
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:06,733 line:-1
whenever a meaningful change occurs.


267
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.837 line:-2 align:center
Although there are new considerations
for managing Apple Watch,


268
00:16:09.903 --> 00:16:13.974 line:-2 align:center
the MDM protocol together with the
Declarative Device Management features


269
00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:16.910 line:-2 align:center
are all the same tools
you’re familiar with using already,


270
00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:21.114 line:-2 align:center
so you’ll be able to get started
with managing Apple Watch today.


271
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:25,719 line:-2
Let's wrap up what we’ve
discussed today about Apple Watch.


272
00:16:25.786 --> 00:16:28.555 line:-2 align:center
Apple Watch is
now manageable in watchOS 10,


273
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:32,793 line:-2
paired to
a supervised iPhone running iOS 17.


274
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.096 line:-2 align:center
Begin implementing your Apple Watch
enrollment and management support


275
00:16:36.163 --> 00:16:40.801 line:-2 align:center
for your MDM solutions today to empower
IT admins and their organizations


276
00:16:40.868 --> 00:16:45.506 line:-2 align:center
to make their enterprise Apple Watch
workflows as easy as possible.


277
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,741 line:-2
Admins, start planning
how managed Apple Watch


278
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:50,210 line:-2
will optimize
your organization’s productivity


279
00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:53.146 line:-2 align:center
and end user’s connectivity
and well-being.


280
00:16:53.213 --> 00:16:55.649 line:-2 align:center
We’re excited to learn about
the Apple Watch workflows


281
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:57,818 line:-2
you plan to implement
and how it will improve


282
00:16:57.885 --> 00:17:01.488 line:-1 align:center
your organization's digital ecosystem.


283
00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:05.692 line:-2 align:center
And whether you are the MDM developer
or admin looking to deploy Apple Watch,


284
00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:07.294 line:-1 align:center
we want to hear from you.


285
00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:11.665 line:-2 align:center
Be sure to file feedback requests
at feedback.apple.com.


286
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:14,201 line:-2
And finally, check out
our other sessions this week


287
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,836 line:-1
on declarative device management


288
00:17:15.903 --> 00:17:19.640 line:-2 align:center
as well as everything else that’s new
in managing Apple Devices.


289
00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:21.975 line:-1 align:center
That’s Device Management for Apple Watch.


290
00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.878 line:-2 align:center
Thanks for being here today,
and have a great week!
