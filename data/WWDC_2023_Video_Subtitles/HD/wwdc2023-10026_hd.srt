00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,845 line:-1
Taylor: Hello, my name is Taylor,


4
00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.381 line:-2 align:center
and I'm a designer
on the Apple Design Team.


5
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:18,352 line:-2
We are so excited to introduce watchOS 10,
the most significant change


6
00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.688 line:-2 align:center
to Apple Watch since its introduction
over eight years ago.


7
00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:25.359 line:-2 align:center
In this session, you'll learn
about what's new in watchOS 10,


8
00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:29.463 line:-2 align:center
how the Apple Design Team approaches
the design of our own apps and the system,


9
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,465 line:-2
and how you can apply
these design patterns


10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,700 line:-2
to make great Apple Watch apps
of your own.


11
00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.869 line:-1 align:center
Let's get started.


12
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,939 line:-1
In 2014, we introduced Apple Watch,


13
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,542 line:-2
the most personal product
we've ever created together.


14
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:45,212 line:-2
It's always with you
and is worn on your body.


15
00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:46.680 line:-1 align:center
In acknowledgement of this,


16
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,316 line:-2
we designed Apple Watch
to offer a wide range


17
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:54,154 line:-2
of stylistic personalization
in case materials, bands, and watch faces.


18
00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.791 line:-2 align:center
And with the introduction
of Apple Watch Ultra,


19
00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:02.663 line:-2 align:center
Apple Watch can be your companion in some
of the most extreme conditions on Earth.


20
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,265 line:-2
The unique constraints
of a device worn on the wrist,


21
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:09,102 line:-2
a comparatively small display,
limited input capabilities,


22
00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:11.171 line:-1 align:center
and generally short interaction times,


23
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:13,874 line:-2
required us create new methods
of interacting,


24
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.909 line:-1 align:center
like the Digital Crown,


25
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,811 line:0
and to focus the design of apps to be


26
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:21,415 align:center
glanceable, actionable, and responsive.


27
00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:24.985 line:-1 align:center
Since then, Apple Watch has evolved a lot.


28
00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:28.589 line:-2 align:center
Its displays are larger, brighter,
and seamlessly integrated


29
00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:30.757 line:-1 align:center
into the curvature of the casing.


30
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:34.661 line:-2 align:center
Apple Watch is also more capable
than ever with cellular connectivity,


31
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,631 line:-2
new Health sensors,
a display that's always on,


32
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,034 line:-2
and apps that are
increasingly full-featured.


33
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:44,638 line:-2
With watchOS 10, we are introducing
an entirely new user interface


34
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.875 line:-2 align:center
for Apple Watch that takes
full advantage of these modern,


35
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:52,012 line:-2
bright displays and more capable,
connected hardware.


36
00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:57.618 line:-2 align:center
watchOS 10 intelligently surfaces timely,
relevant widgets right on your watch face


37
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,921 line:-2
that you can access
by turning the Digital Crown.


38
00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.891 line:-1 align:center
The Home Screen is easier to navigate.


39
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,126 line:-2
Rotate the Digital Crown
to move vertically


40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,729 line:-1
through a consistent organization of apps.


41
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:11,398 line:-2
And you can click the Side Button once
to open Control Center


42
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.635 line:-2 align:center
from anywhere you are,
or twice to open Wallet.


43
00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.939 line:-2 align:center
And we've redesigned every app
with a focus on glanceability,


44
00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:23.510 line:-2 align:center
clarity, and consistent placement
of controls and navigation.


45
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:28,015 line:-2
We designed watchOS 10 by following
a rigorous and methodical design process


46
00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:30.150 line:-1 align:center
centered around clear design principles


47
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,886 line:-2
that you can apply
to the design of your apps.


48
00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:36.790 line:-2 align:center
Apple Watch apps should be
focused and highly-specialized


49
00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.159 line:-1 align:center
in the utility they provide users.


50
00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:41.094 line:-1 align:center
The design of each screen should optimize


51
00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:44.131 line:-2 align:center
for glanceability
and short interaction time.


52
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,468 line:-2
And controls and navigation
should be clear and consistent.


53
00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:51.839 line:-2 align:center
Compared to the original Apple Watch,
Apple Watch Series 8


54
00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:56.043 line:-2 align:center
and Apple Watch Ultra have much larger,
more rounded displays.


55
00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:59.313 line:-2 align:center
To bring more navigational consistency
to our app designs


56
00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:02.850 line:-2 align:center
and increase their glanceability,
we established a new approach to layout


57
00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.886 line:-2 align:center
that informed the design
of individual apps.


58
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,023 line:-2
This new system is based on the shape
of the display and defines the size


59
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,360 line:-2
and placement of controls,
labels, and content,


60
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:18,131 line:-2
making apps more consistent in layout
and controls more clear and ergonomic.


61
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,367 line:-1
To accommodate different types of content,


62
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.237 line:-1 align:center
we designed three foundational layouts:


63
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,442 line:0
Dial, Infographic, and List.


64
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,411 line:0
All of these layouts are designed
to adapt automatically


65
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:35,649 align:center
to the different Apple Watch sizes
supported by watchOS 10 .


66
00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:39.253 line:-2 align:center
Apps in watchOS 10 also make
considerate use of background content


67
00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:43.891 line:-2 align:center
to convey additional information,
like the time of day in World Clock,


68
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,260 line:-1
the current conditions in Weather,


69
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:50,697 line:-2
or whether a company's stock price
is trending up or down.


70
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,967 line:-2
For instance, in Activity,
each Infographic view


71
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,371 line:-2
for the Move, Exercise,
and Stand Activity Rings


72
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:01,074 line:-2
has a background that matches the color
of the ring you're focused on.


73
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,644 line:-2
Use background colors
to help users navigate


74
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,647 line:-2
or to aid in recognition
of what app they're using.


75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,983 line:-2
Background content in watchOS 10
should play a supporting role


76
00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:13.921 line:-2 align:center
that provides additional utility,
not merely be a visual flourish.


77
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:17,257 line:-2
Background content can be
as simple as a color, gradient,


78
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:21.628 line:-2 align:center
or as sophisticated as an animation
that communicates additional information.


79
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:24,164 line:-2
Consider using color
to help people who use your app


80
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,333 line:-1
understand their sense of place.


81
00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:31.238 line:-2 align:center
In addition to background content,
watchOS 10 introduces new applications


82
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,941 line:-1
of materials across the system.


83
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:38,946 line:-2
Distinct, functional layers utilize
translucency to establish hierarchy


84
00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.884 line:-2 align:center
and help users understand where they are
in the system or inside an app.


85
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:47,287 line:-2
These new materials maximize
the amount of space for content,


86
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:51.024 line:-2 align:center
while allowing system elements
like the Status Bar to remain legible


87
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,827 line:-1
when content is scrolled underneath them.


88
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:58.332 line:-2 align:center
Additionally, elements using
semantic system colors automatically adapt


89
00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:03.070 line:-2 align:center
their contrast when placed
on top of vibrant background materials.


90
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,139 line:-2
watchOS 10 also introduces
new navigation patterns:


91
00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:10.677 line:-2 align:center
Vertical pagination, source list,
and refined hierarchical navigation


92
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:14,882 line:-2
designed to help make apps easier
and more consistent to navigate.


93
00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:18.485 line:-2 align:center
The Digital Crown is a unique
input mechanism we designed


94
00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.621 line:-2 align:center
to address the needs
of a product this small,


95
00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:24.691 line:-2 align:center
having a way navigate without occluding
the display with your finger.


96
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:28,395 line:-2
In watchOS 10, the Digital Crown
is used to navigate to apps,


97
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,998 line:-1
and also navigate within apps.


98
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:34.568 line:-2 align:center
In List-based views, like Mail,
you can rotate the Digital Crown


99
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:38.505 line:-2 align:center
to scroll vertically through the list
of inboxes or mail messages.


100
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,775 line:-2
For apps with multiple tabs,
watchOS 10 introduces


101
00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:45.312 line:-2 align:center
a new navigation pattern,
vertical pagination.


102
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,081 line:-2
In Activity,
we use the Digital Crown to navigate


103
00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:51.919 line:-2 align:center
between the Activity Rings overview
and the individual infographic views


104
00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:54.955 line:-1 align:center
for the Move, Exercise, and Stand rings.


105
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:59,059 line:-2
Vertical pagination is a great way
to separate multiple views of information


106
00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:02.362 line:-2 align:center
inside your app into distinct,
purposeful screens.


107
00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:05.732 line:-2 align:center
The page indicator is aligned
to the Digital Crown and is designed


108
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,368 line:-2
to adapt and remain visible
on any background.


109
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:12,306 line:-2
Sometimes, an element in your design
exists in multiple pages of your app,


110
00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:16.076 line:-2 align:center
like the Activity Rings in Activity
or Dials in Stopwatch.


111
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,014 line:-2
Smoothly animate elements between pages
by manipulating their scale,


112
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,450 line:-1
position, and information density,


113
00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:27.721 line:-2 align:center
instead of introducing additional
instances of that element on each page.


114
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,758 line:-2
This object permanence helps
provide a visual anchor for users


115
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:35,062 line:-2
as they navigate
through full-screen pages of content.


116
00:06:35.095 --> 00:06:37.464 line:-1 align:center
Generally, we advise limiting the content


117
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,900 line:-2
of an individual page
to a single screen height.


118
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,669 line:-2
Embracing this constraint
encourages each page to serve


119
00:06:42.703 --> 00:06:46.707 line:-2 align:center
a clear and distinct purpose
and results in a more glanceable design.


120
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.077 line:-2 align:center
However, we know there a certain cases
where it's necessary for content


121
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.180 line:-2 align:center
to extend
beyond the height of the display.


122
00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:56.583 line:-2 align:center
One example of this is Messages,
which contains two pages,


123
00:06:56.617 --> 00:06:58.485 line:-1 align:center
one for your pinned conversations


124
00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:02.456 line:-2 align:center
and another containing conversations
with other people or groups.


125
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:07,761 line:-2
This first page is a fixed height and can
contain up to nine pinned conversations.


126
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,597 line:-2
The second page is a scroll view
that scrolls vertically


127
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,166 line:-1
after it becomes the active page.


128
00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:16.837 line:-2 align:center
In Contacts,
the first page of a contact card


129
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,374 line:-2
provides a detailed photo
and frequently used actions.


130
00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:21.875 line:-1 align:center
The second page is a scroll view


131
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:25.345 line:-2 align:center
and contains
less frequently used contact details.


132
00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:29.082 line:-2 align:center
We recommend using scroll views
inside pages judiciously and,


133
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:33,520 line:-2
if possible, placing them only after
fixed height pages in your app design.


134
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:37,090 line:-2
Use Vertical Pagination
in place of horizontal pagination,


135
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,294 line:-2
which is more difficult
to navigate on Apple Watch.


136
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,429 line:-2
In contexts
where the Digital Crown does not need


137
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.765 line:-1 align:center
to navigate lists or between pages,


138
00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:48.735 line:-2 align:center
it is a fantastic tool
to inspect data in your app.


139
00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:51.738 line:-2 align:center
In World Clock,
rotating the Digital Crown advances


140
00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:53.574 line:-1 align:center
the time of day at a selected location,


141
00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:57.945 line:-2 align:center
allowing users to compare various times
of day to their current time.


142
00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:01.181 line:-2 align:center
World Clock also makes use
of Split Views in watchOS 10


143
00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:04.952 line:-2 align:center
to introduce a new navigation pattern,
Source Lists.


144
00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:08.522 line:-2 align:center
In source list based apps,
users navigate between detail views


145
00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:12.492 line:-2 align:center
for multiple entities
containing the same type of information.


146
00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:16.230 line:-2 align:center
These apps open to the detail view,
and users can tap the Source List Button


147
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,732 line:-2
in the upper left
to switch between entities,


148
00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:21.935 line:-1 align:center
such as multiple locations in World Clock.


149
00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:25.038 line:-2 align:center
Traditional hierarchical navigation
is still supported,


150
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,708 line:-2
but it should be used considerately,
and only when your app


151
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:30.077 line:-2 align:center
cannot more succinctly
represent its content


152
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,148 line:-2
in a two-level, Source List based design
or as distinct vertical pages.


153
00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:37.117 line:-1 align:center
Settings and Mail are good examples


154
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.821 line:-2 align:center
of where deeper hierarchical navigation
is appropriate.


155
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:44.658 line:-2 align:center
watchOS 10 introduces a new animation
for hierarchical navigation
