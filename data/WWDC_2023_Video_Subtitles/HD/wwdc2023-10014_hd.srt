00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:12.813 line:-1 align:center
Hello, and welcome.


4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.214 line:-1 align:center
My name is Chong.


5
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:18,085 line:-2
I'm an engineering manager
on the App Store Connect team.


6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,455 line:-2
Later, I will be joined
by my colleague, Claire,


7
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,091 line:-2
and in this session,
we are going to explore


8
00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.126 line:-1 align:center
what's new in App Store pricing.


9
00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.629 line:-1 align:center
In March of this year,


10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,198 line:-1
we released the largest set of upgrades


11
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,100 line:-1
to App Store pricing capabilities


12
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.369 line:-1 align:center
since the App Store first launched.


13
00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.604 line:-1 align:center
Today, we'll walk you through


14
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,673 line:-1
the new global pricing features


15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,807 line:-1
and demonstrate


16
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,577 line:-2
how to use them to set prices
for your apps


17
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,812 line:-1
and in-app purchases in App Store Connect.


18
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,283 line:-1
Additionally, we'll explore


19
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,084 line:-1
advanced pricing tools


20
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,820 line:-1
tailored for managing pricing by region,


21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,356 line:-2
which can support
more intricate use cases.


22
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,627 line:-1
Let's dive into our first topic:


23
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,095 line:-1
enhanced global pricing.


24
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,568 line:-2
At the App Store, we understand
the challenges of managing pricing


25
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,803 line:-1
across 44 currencies


26
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.339 line:-1 align:center
and 175 regions,


27
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:16,243 line:-2
with many of these regions
also incorporating local taxes.


28
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,946 line:-1
To streamline this process,


29
00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:21.315 line:-1 align:center
we've developed global pricing tools


30
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.786 line:-2 align:center
that simplify pricing of your apps,
in-app purchases, globally.


31
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:30.624 line:-2 align:center
To provide you
with more pricing flexibility,


32
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,526 line:-1
we have significantly increased


33
00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:34.795 line:-1 align:center
the number of available price points,


34
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:38,498 line:-1
which now totals up to 900 price point


35
00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:42.069 line:-2 align:center
for apps, in-app purchases,
and subscriptions.


36
00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:46.340 line:-2 align:center
By default, you have access
to 800 price points,


37
00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.741 line:-1 align:center
and upon request,


38
00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:50.344 line:-1 align:center
an additional 100 higher price points


39
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.411 line:-1 align:center
will be available.


40
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,314 line:-1
These expanded price points


41
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:55.816 line:-1 align:center
are also available


42
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,118 line:-1
for 44 different currencies.


43
00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.889 line:-1 align:center
In addition to the expanded price points,


44
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,525 line:-1
we have also introduced a pricing tool


45
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:07.027 line:-1 align:center
that allows you to configure a base region


46
00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:08.428 line:-1 align:center
for your base price


47
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,565 line:-1
from any of 175 regions,


48
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,801 line:-1
facilitating streamlined global pricing.


49
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,272 line:-2
Let me give you an example
to illustrate this process more clearly.


50
00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:23.277 line:-3 align:center
You can start by choosing a base region
for your base price.


51
00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:27.814 line:-3 align:center
The base region can be decided
by taking into account various factors,


52
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,983 line:-2
such as your target market,


53
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,119 line:-2
the location of your user base,


54
00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:34.354 line:-2 align:center
or any business-related reasons.


55
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,092 line:-3
In this example, I will select
the United States


56
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,928 line:-2
for my base region.


57
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,732 line:-3
Next, you can choose a price
from any of 900 price points


58
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,267 line:-2
to serve as the basis.


59
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:54,208 line:-3
In this example, I will set $7.99
as my base price.


60
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,045 line:0
The App Store will then use
this base price


61
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,214 align:center
to generate equivalent prices


62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,882 line:1
for the remaining regions,


63
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,151 line:1
factoring in foreign exchange rate


64
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,285 line:1
and certain taxes.


65
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,488 line:1
Global equalization also follows


66
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,524 align:center
the most common pricing convention


67
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:11,825 align:center
in each region,


68
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,161 line:1
ensuring that customers see prices


69
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,964 align:center
that are most relevant
to their local currency.


70
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:22.236 line:-2 align:center
Moreover, the generated prices
will be automatically adjusted


71
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,572 line:-2
to keep global prices in line
with your base price


72
00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.742 line:-2 align:center
as foreign exchange rate
and tax fluctuate.


73
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,513 line:0
For instance, if the UK pound
and Japanese yen


74
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,681 align:center
weaken against the US dollar


75
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,550 line:1
and other currencies,


76
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,852 align:center
prices in the UK and Japan


77
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,755 line:0
would increase to maintain
price equalization


78
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,190 line:1
with the base US price.


79
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,093 line:1
It is important to note that


80
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,296 line:0
the base price will not be
automatically adjusted


81
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,032 align:center
since it's set as the base
for other prices.


82
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:57,671 align:center
You can also schedule
a global price change in the future.


83
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,908 line:0
In this example, I will schedule
a price increase


84
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,278 line:1
for my base price to $9.99


85
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,614 align:center
on January 1, 2024,


86
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,349 align:center
and just like the initial price setup,


87
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,519 line:0
the App Store will generate
equivalent prices


88
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,488 line:1
with a new upcoming base price


89
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,656 line:1
in the remaining regions


90
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,791 line:1
with the same future start date.


91
00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:21.662 line:-2 align:center
Next up, Claire will provide
a comprehensive walkthrough


92
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,065 line:-2
of how to make the most
of the new global pricing features


93
00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:26.200 line:-1 align:center
in App Store Connect,


94
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.503 line:-2 align:center
as well as the associated
App Store Connect APIs.


95
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.637 line:-1 align:center
Over to you, Claire.


96
00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:34.341 line:-2 align:center
Thanks, Chong!
My name is Claire Liu.


97
00:04:34.408 --> 00:04:36.810 line:-2 align:center
I'm a software engineer
for App Store Connect.


98
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,079 line:-1
Over the next few minutes,


99
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,682 line:-2
I'll walk you through how to set up
your global pricing


100
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,519 line:-2
in App Store Connect
and with the App Store Connect APIs.


101
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.090 line:-2 align:center
I'll use the app Backyard Birds
as an example,


102
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,527 line:-1
set its price to $7.99,


103
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,697 line:-2
and schedule a global price change
next year.


104
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,233 line:-1
To set up initial pricing for your apps,


105
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.936 line:-2 align:center
in the sidebar,
click Pricing and Availability.


106
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,974 line:-2
Then, under the Price Schedule,
click Add Pricing.


107
00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:11.378 line:-2 align:center
From here,
select a base country or region.


108
00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:13.680 line:-1 align:center
The App Store will use this base


109
00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:18.919 line:-2 align:center
to provide comparable prices
on the other 174 regions.


110
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:23,223 line:-2
You can change this base configuration
later at any time.


111
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.326 line:-2 align:center
I'm going to choose the United States
for this app.


112
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,264 line:-1
After selecting a base country or region,


113
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,766 line:-1
select a price from the drop-down menu.


114
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,137 line:-2
Initially, the list displays
25 price points


115
00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:39.740 line:-2 align:center
that follow
the most common pricing convention


116
00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:41.375 line:-1 align:center
for each country or region.


117
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:45,012 line:-1
To view more available price points,


118
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,147 line:-2
scroll to the end of the menu


119
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,516 line:-2
and click See Additional Prices.


120
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:55,522 line:-2
I'm going to choose 7.99
for Backyard Birds.


121
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,259 line:-2
Next, you will see a screen
with comparable prices


122
00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:02.095 line:-1 align:center
for all the other countries or regions.


123
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:06,633 line:-2
By default, the App Store
will automatically adjust prices for you.


124
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.003 line:-2 align:center
You don't have to make
any changes if this is what you want.


125
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,007 line:-2
Alternatively, you can choose
different prices


126
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,476 line:-1
for individual countries or regions.


127
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,546 line:-1
However, if you select your own prices,


128
00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:22.516 line:-2 align:center
you will not benefit
from the automatic repricing


129
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,319 line:-1
for foreign exchange and tax rate,


130
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,957 line:-2
and you will be responsible for reflecting
those changes in your prices.


131
00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:33.927 line:-2 align:center
I'm happy with the comparable prices
provided by the App Store,


132
00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:37.831 line:-2 align:center
so I will keep the original values
and go to the next step.


133
00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:42.269 line:-2 align:center
Finally, I will review
and confirm the prices.


134
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,739 line:-1
After confirming my initial pricing,


135
00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:48.742 line:-2 align:center
I can see my base country or region
and prices


136
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,044 line:-1
in the Price Schedule section.


137
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:53.847 line:-1 align:center
The label "May Adjust Automatically"


138
00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:57.484 line:-2 align:center
indicates that the prices
for listed countries or regions


139
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,087 line:-1
other than the base may be adjusted


140
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:04,157 line:-2
to account for changes
in foreign exchange or tax rate.


141
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:09,229 line:-2
So you might be wondering: what happens
when the prices are adjusted?


142
00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:12.399 line:-1 align:center
Whenever an automatic adjustment happens,


143
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:16,136 line:-2
the upcoming changes will be displayed
in App Store Connect


144
00:07:16.203 --> 00:07:19.106 line:-1 align:center
at least 14 days in advance.


145
00:07:19.173 --> 00:07:23.277 line:-2 align:center
For example, I can see that there's
an upcoming price change


146
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:27,114 line:-2
on September 1
in two countries or regions.


147
00:07:27.181 --> 00:07:31.151 line:-2 align:center
I'll click on the effective date to check
what the new prices will be.


148
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:36,690 line:-2
In the pop-up modal, I can see the prices
in Japan and UK


149
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,726 line:-1
will increase on September 1, 2023.


150
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.730 line:-2 align:center
Let's come back
to my initial price schedule,


151
00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:46.066 line:-1 align:center
which has no adjustments.


152
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,870 line:-2
Now, I'd like to schedule a price increase
for my app,


153
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,072 line:-1
so I will click the plus button.


154
00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:56.643 line:-2 align:center
There are three types of price changes
you can schedule:


155
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.313 line:-1 align:center
global, temporary, and custom.


156
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:04,051 line:-2
I will talk about the last two options
later, but in this example,


157
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:07,754 line:-2
I'm going to schedule
the global price change for my app.


158
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:13.460 line:-2 align:center
Next, I will choose January 1, 2024,
as the effective date.


159
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:19,833 line:-2
Then, I'm going to increase
the base price of my app to $9.99.


160
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:24,505 line:-2
Next, the App Store will provide
the comparable prices


161
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:28.141 line:-1 align:center
on the other 174 countries or regions


162
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,643 line:-1
based on the new price.


163
00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:34.648 line:-2 align:center
I will review the prices in each region
carefully and confirm.


164
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,822 line:-2
After confirming, I can see that there is
a price change on January 1, 2024,


165
00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:43.690 line:-1 align:center
in the Upcoming Changes section.


166
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:49,863 line:-2
That's how enhanced global pricing
works in App Store Connect.


167
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,902 line:-2
Now I'm going to show you how it works
with App Store Connect APIs.


168
00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:57.104 line:-1 align:center
You can get your app's price schedule,


169
00:08:57,171 --> 00:09:00,574 line:-2
including current prices
and upcoming changes,


170
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:03,410 line:-1
from the AppPriceSchedules resource.


171
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:06,880 line:-1
AppPriceSchedule has three relationships:


172
00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:11.285 line:-2 align:center
base territory, manual prices,
and automatic prices.


173
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:16,690 line:-2
Manual Prices and automatic prices
contain multiple app prices.


174
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:21,528 line:-2
Each AppPrice resource is linked
to an AppPricePoint,


175
00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:24.298 line:-1 align:center
which is linked to a territory.


176
00:09:24.364 --> 00:09:29.236 line:-2 align:center
App price point and Territory are
read-only reference data.


177
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:34,107 line:-2
So, I need to make three API calls
to get the entire price schedule.


178
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,411 line:-1
I'll go over the three APIs one by one,


179
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:41,381 line:-2
using the initial price schedule
I just set for Backyard Birds app


180
00:09:41.448 --> 00:09:42.716 line:-1 align:center
as an example.


181
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:48,422 line:-2
First, use Get/appPriceSchedules
/appId/baseTerritory


182
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:52,125 line:-2
to get the base country or region
of the app's price schedule.


183
00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:56.063 line:-2 align:center
I can see that it is currently
the United States.


184
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,601 line:-1
Then use Get/manualPrices.


185
00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:04.371 line:-2 align:center
I will include the price point
and territory relations


186
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,306 line:-1
to get the price point information.


187
00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:10.677 line:-2 align:center
In this example, it contains
only one app price


188
00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:12.746 line:-1 align:center
that I set for the United States.


189
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:17.518 line:-2 align:center
Finally, I can list
the automatically generated prices


190
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:21,388 line:-1
by calling the Get/automaticPrices API.


191
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,391 line:-2
The response will contain
the automatic prices


192
00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:27.995 line:-2 align:center
for regions you haven't manually set
prices for.


193
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:33,467 line:-2
In my app Backyard Birds,
it will return 174 prices,


194
00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:36.303 line:-2 align:center
much more than what I can fit
on the screen.


195
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,239 line:-2
Now you know how to read
the full price schedule.


196
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:43,243 line:-2
If you'd like to make changes
to your app's price schedule,


197
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,381 line:-2
you can update the baseTerritory
and manualPrices relationships


198
00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:49.850 line:-1 align:center
in the AppPriceSchedules resource.


199
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:54,454 line:-2
The App Store will provide
comparable automatic prices


200
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:58,292 line:-2
based on the base territory
and manual prices.


201
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,727 line:-1
Let's take a look at the APIs you need


202
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,664 line:-2
when updating
the price schedule one by one.


203
00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:09.369 line:-2 align:center
First, get all the price points
of your selected base country or region.


204
00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:11.605 line:-1 align:center
Choose a base price.


205
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:17,010 line:-2
Next, preview the comparable price points
in other countries or regions.


206
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:21,381 line:-2
Finally, update the price schedule
with all the necessary data.


207
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,054 line:-2
I'm going to schedule a price increase
for Backyard Birds.


208
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.291 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a closer look at how to use
these APIs to achieve it.


209
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,529 line:-2
First, I get
all the available price points


210
00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:39.466 line:-2 align:center
in my app
of my selected base territory, US.


211
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,972 line:-2
The price point resource includes
detailed pricing information.


212
00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:50.611 line:-2 align:center
I'll choose this $9.99 price point
and keep a record of its ID.


213
00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:55.649 line:-2 align:center
Before setting the chosen price point
in my price schedule,


214
00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:59.219 line:-2 align:center
I'd like to know
what the comparable prices will be.


215
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,355 line:-1
I will get the comparable price points


216
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,459 line:-2
of the price point I chose earlier,
in the previous step,


217
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:08,595 line:-1
using the Get/equalizations API.


218
00:12:08.662 --> 00:12:11.565 line:-2 align:center
I will include territory relation
in the request


219
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:14,968 line:-2
to identify the location
of the comparable price point.


220
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:21,808 line:-2
For example, I can see
the comparable price in Canada is $12.99.


221
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:26,446 line:-2
Next, I will need to update
the appPriceSchedule


222
00:12:26.513 --> 00:12:30.083 line:-1 align:center
with the Post/appPriceSchedules API.


223
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:35.656 line:-2 align:center
AppPriceSchedule doesn't have
any attributes, just three relationships.


224
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:40,160 line:-1
First, add the app ID in app relationship.


225
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:46,466 line:-2
Next, specify the base country or region's
ID in base territory relationship.


226
00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:47.835 line:-1 align:center
I will use USA.


227
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,872 line:-2
Finally, I need to define
the manual prices


228
00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:53.473 line:-1 align:center
for the base country or region.


229
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,877 line:-1
Since this is a Post API,


230
00:12:56,944 --> 00:13:00,514 line:-2
my new schedule will overwrite
my existing schedule,


231
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:05.052 line:-2 align:center
so I will need to include current prices
and add new prices.


232
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.158 line:-2 align:center
I'm going to define a new current price
and assign it a temporary ID.


233
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,727 line:-1
newprice-0.


234
00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:17.297 line:-2 align:center
If you're familiar
with the App Store Connect APIs,


235
00:13:17.364 --> 00:13:21.935 line:-2 align:center
you know that you can use any values
you want for these temporary IDs,


236
00:13:22.002 --> 00:13:24.171 line:-1 align:center
as long as they follow this syntax


237
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:27,107 line:-2
with a dollar sign and braces
around the ID.


238
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,310 line:-1
To schedule a global price change,


239
00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:32.412 line:-1 align:center
I'll add a new app price


240
00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:36.483 line:-2 align:center
and assign it
another temporary ID, newprice-1.


241
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:42,089 line:-2
Now I need to define
the two new app prices.


242
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:47,194 line:-2
This is my app's current price that I got
earlier from the Get/manualPrices API.


243
00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:54.801 line:-2 align:center
First, set the ID to be same as we defined
in the payload in the previous step.


244
00:13:54.868 --> 00:13:57.938 line:-1 align:center
Next, define the price point ID.


245
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,707 line:-1
I will keep the current price point.


246
00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:02.943 line:-1 align:center
To schedule a global price change,


247
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,845 line:-1
I need to end the current price


248
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:08,849 line:-2
on the new price's start date:
January 1, 2024.


249
00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:16.523 line:-2 align:center
Next, define the new price's resource
with another temporary ID.


250
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:21.595 line:-2 align:center
I need to set the new price's start date
to 2024, January 1,


251
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,932 line:-2
and assign the new price point ID
to the price.


252
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.036 line:-1 align:center
Coming back to the request entity,


253
00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:31.772 line:-1 align:center
I'll add an "included" section.


254
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,210 line:-2
Then I take the new price resources
that I just defined


255
00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:38.879 line:-1 align:center
and insert them into this included array.


256
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.583 line:-1 align:center
The final payload looks like this…


257
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,527 line:-2
Before sending this payload
to Post/appPriceSchedules API,


258
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:57,865 line:-2
keep in mind that if a price's start date
is null in the payload,


259
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:02,369 line:-2
the price will go live immediately
in the associated region.


260
00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:05.205 line:-1 align:center
So I recommend testing this API


261
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,609 line:-2
with an app that is not live
in the App Store yet.


262
00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:11.545 line:-2 align:center
That's how you would use
the new pricing tools


263
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:14,314 line:-1
to effortlessly set global prices


264
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,484 line:-2
and let the App Store do
all the heavy lifting.


265
00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:22.489 line:-2 align:center
If you want full control over your prices,
we have more options for you.


266
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,659 line:-2
I will hand over to Chong to introduce
the new features


267
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,961 line:-1
for managing pricing by region.


268
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:28,862 line:-1
Chong?


269
00:15:29.663 --> 00:15:30.631 line:-1 align:center
Thanks, Claire!


270
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,100 line:-1
As you can see from Claire's walkthrough,


271
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:37,771 line:-2
the global pricing features provide you
with an easy way to price your apps


272
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:39,873 line:-1
and in-app purchases globally.


273
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,511 line:-2
Up next, let's explore
the new advanced pricing tools


274
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:47,080 line:-1
designed for managing pricing by region.


275
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,151 line:-2
In addition
to the automated global pricing,


276
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,420 line:-1
we also provide you with more control


277
00:15:53.487 --> 00:15:56.757 line:-1 align:center
over your pricing at the regional level.


278
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,325 line:-1
The advanced pricing tool


279
00:15:58.392 --> 00:16:01.528 line:-1 align:center
facilitate manually setting custom prices


280
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:04,364 line:-2
and temporary prices
with any price point


281
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,033 line:-1
on a per-region basis.


282
00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:08.635 line:-1 align:center
Let's start with temporary prices.


283
00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:14.474 line:-2 align:center
This is a way to manually set prices
for a short period of time.


284
00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:17.678 line:-2 align:center
Let me demonstrate this
with an example.


285
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:24,151 align:center
Here, I have set $7.99 in the US
as the base price


286
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:27,554 line:0
and autogenerated prices
for the rest of the regions.


287
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:32,392 align:center
And I plan to run a special promotion
in Canada and France for a few days.


288
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:36,630 align:center
For this promotion, I will lower the price


289
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:39,433 align:center
to $4.99 in Canada


290
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,302 line:1
and €4.99 in France


291
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:46,073 line:1
from February 1 to February 3, 2024.


292
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,041 align:center
After February 3,


293
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,277 align:center
the price will go back
to the initial price,


294
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:52,779 line:0
equalized to my base price.


295
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,115 line:1
During the temporary price change period,


296
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,317 align:center
the prices for Canada and France


297
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,953 line:1
will not be automatically adjusted.


298
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,389 align:center
And there's no limit to the number
of regions


299
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,258 align:center
you can manually manage.


300
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,793 align:center
And you have the option
to manually manage prices


301
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,228 line:1
in certain regions


302
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:12,366 align:center
while having the App Store
automatically adjust prices in others,


303
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,368 line:1
as demonstrated in this example.


304
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,505 line:-1
You can also set up custom regional prices


305
00:17:18.572 --> 00:17:20.507 line:-1 align:center
on a permanent basis.


306
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:22,442 line:-1
Let me show you how it works.


307
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:26,914 line:0
Here, I want to set up custom prices
for all the regions,


308
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,882 line:1
using USD as a currency,


309
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:31,385 line:1
to make their prices consistent.


310
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:32,986 line:1
In this example,


311
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:37,124 align:center
I will set custom prices to $9.99


312
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:39,426 align:center
for the United States and Argentina.


313
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:42,829 align:center
You may notice that in this example,


314
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:46,667 align:center
I have set a custom price
to my base region.


315
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,303 align:center
Setting a custom price for the base region


316
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,572 align:center
disables the automatic adjustment


317
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,474 align:center
of the prices for all the other regions.


318
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,143 line:1
Therefore, it is critical


319
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,613 line:0
to ensure you understand
and review your price changes


320
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,616 line:0
before they become effective
for your customers.


321
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,753 line:0
The custom price feature provide
the ability


322
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,455 line:1
to manually manage prices


323
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,792 line:1
for any region on a permanent basis,


324
00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:14.394 line:-2 align:center
but it comes with the need
for extra caution.


325
00:18:15.729 --> 00:18:17.564 line:-1 align:center
Once a custom price is set,


326
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:21,168 line:-2
the App Store no longer makes
automatic adjustment,


327
00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:25.606 line:-2 align:center
meaning you will need to keep track of
and modify your pricing strategies


328
00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:29.376 line:-2 align:center
to accommodate fluctuations
in exchange rates and taxes.


329
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:33,080 line:-2
And now, I will hand it over to Claire
once again.


330
00:18:33.146 --> 00:18:35.916 line:-2 align:center
She will provide you
with step-by-step guidance


331
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:36,984 line:-1
and insightful tips


332
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,054 line:-2
on how to effectively utilize
the advanced pricing tools


333
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,356 line:-1
in App Store Connect,


334
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,893 line:-2
as well as the related
App Store Connect APIs.


335
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,994 line:-1
Over to you, Claire.


336
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:49,196 line:-1
Thanks, Chong!


337
00:18:49.263 --> 00:18:52.599 line:-2 align:center
In the next few minutes,
I'm going to show you how to set up


338
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,034 line:-1
temporary prices,


339
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:55,435 line:-1
custom prices,


340
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,338 line:-1
and show you some API examples.


341
00:18:58.405 --> 00:19:01.909 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a look at how to set up
temporary prices first.


342
00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:04.411 line:-1 align:center
For example, I'd like to schedule


343
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,147 line:-2
a regional spring promotion
for Backyard Birds.


344
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,584 line:-1
In the Pricing and Availability section,


345
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:12.252 line:-1 align:center
next to Price Schedule,


346
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,987 line:-1
I'll click the plus button.


347
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:19,193 line:-2
From there, I will select
the Temporary Price Change option.


348
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:23,397 line:-2
I'm going to schedule
a temporary promotion in early spring,


349
00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:27.401 line:-2 align:center
so I will choose February 1 to February 3
next year


350
00:19:27.467 --> 00:19:29.770 line:-1 align:center
as my start and end date.


351
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,905 line:-1
Then, in the next step,


352
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:35,576 line:-2
I'm going to choose Canada and France
for this promotion


353
00:19:35.642 --> 00:19:37.511 line:-1 align:center
and then click Next.


354
00:19:37.578 --> 00:19:40.614 line:-1 align:center
Select a country or region and a price.


355
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,084 line:-2
The App Store will use this to provide
comparable prices


356
00:19:44.151 --> 00:19:47.654 line:-1 align:center
across the selected countries or regions.


357
00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:53.126 line:-2 align:center
I'm going to choose a lower price
of €4.99 in France,


358
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:57,231 line:-2
since this is a promotion
outside of my base region.


359
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:01,635 line:-2
You can review the comparable prices
for each selected country or region


360
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,271 line:-1
and make any necessary changes.


361
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:08,408 line:-2
I'm happy with the comparable prices,
so I will click Next


362
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,978 line:-1
to review and then confirm my changes.


363
00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:15.115 line:-2 align:center
After I confirmed
my temporary price change,


364
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:20,787 line:-2
the manually adjusted temporary prices
appeared in the Upcoming Changes section,


365
00:20:20.854 --> 00:20:24.157 line:-2 align:center
and the prices will go back
to be automatically adjusted


366
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,292 line:-1
after the promotion.


367
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:30,864 line:-2
Next, let's take a look
at how to set up custom prices.


368
00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:34.201 line:-2 align:center
I already have
the initial pricing schedule set up.


369
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:37,905 line:-2
In this example, I'd like to have
full control


370
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:41,275 line:-1
over my app's pricing starting October,


371
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,144 line:-1
so I will click the plus button


372
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:47,848 line:-2
and select Custom Price Change
option in the modal.


373
00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:53.153 line:-2 align:center
Next, I'm going to choose October 1, 2023,
as the effective date.


374
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:58,325 line:-2
If you'd like to setup custom prices
in only a few regions,


375
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:00,427 line:-1
select the first option,


376
00:21:00.494 --> 00:21:04.665 line:-2 align:center
"Manually manage prices
in specific countries or regions."


377
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:09,803 line:-2
Then, use the same steps
as in the temporary price change flow.


378
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,105 line:-1
Make your price selections.


379
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:15,409 line:-2
However, I would like
to manually manage price


380
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:19,446 line:-1
in all 175 countries or regions,


381
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:22,783 line:-1
so I will choose the second option.


382
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:24.251 line:-1 align:center
In the next step,


383
00:21:24.318 --> 00:21:27.955 line:-2 align:center
I will select a price for my base country
or region.


384
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,957 line:-1
This price must be selected


385
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:36,463 line:-2
for you to manually manage prices
in all 175 countries or regions.


386
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,400 line:-2
You can keep the current base price
as is or update it.


387
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:44.371 line:-1 align:center
To have more consistent prices in USD,


388
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:48,509 line:-1
I'm going to increase the prices to $9.99


389
00:21:48.575 --> 00:21:51.945 line:-1 align:center
in countries or regions that use USD.


390
00:21:52.012 --> 00:21:55.215 line:-1 align:center
I'm not going to change the other prices.


391
00:21:55.282 --> 00:21:58.285 line:-1 align:center
I'll click Next and review the prices


392
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:02,489 line:-2
for the countries or regions
that I didn't select a price for.


393
00:22:02.556 --> 00:22:06.593 line:-2 align:center
If you select a base country or region
in temporary price change flow,


394
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,161 line:-1
you will see this step too.


395
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:13,200 line:-2
Next, I will review and confirm
my custom prices


396
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:15,402 line:-1
in all countries or regions.


397
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:19,473 line:-2
After confirming the changes,
now I can see


398
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.777 line:-2 align:center
the Manually Adjusted custom prices
in the Upcoming Changes section.


399
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:27,781 line:-2
App Store Connect provides
a guided experience


400
00:22:27.848 --> 00:22:31.151 line:-2 align:center
for you to manually manage prices
by region,


401
00:22:31,218 --> 00:22:36,190 line:-2
and you can set up manual prices
in each region with APIs too.


402
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:41,261 line:-2
It is important to remember
that temporary prices and custom prices


403
00:22:41.328 --> 00:22:43.096 line:-1 align:center
are manual prices.


404
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:48,302 line:-2
I will show you an example of scheduling
a spring promotion in Canada with the API.


405
00:22:49,403 --> 00:22:51,805 line:-1
To schedule a temporary manual price,


406
00:22:51.872 --> 00:22:55.209 line:-1 align:center
I will use the Post/appPriceSchedules API


407
00:22:55.275 --> 00:22:57.444 line:-1 align:center
to overwrite my current price schedule.


408
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:02,049 line:-2
Replace the manual prices
with the base price


409
00:23:02.115 --> 00:23:04.585 line:-1 align:center
and the new temporary price in Canada.


410
00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:08.856 line:-2 align:center
Before I define a temporary price
in Canada,


411
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:12,459 line:-2
I need to define the current base price
in USA.


412
00:23:12.526 --> 00:23:14.361 line:-1 align:center
I will not change this price.


413
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:18,131 line:-1
To define a temporary price in Canada,


414
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:23,203 line:-2
I will link it to a Canadian price point
and set the start and end date.


415
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:28,041 line:-1
Coming back to the request entity,


416
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:31,278 line:-2
I will include the two manual prices
I defined


417
00:23:31.345 --> 00:23:36.683 line:-2 align:center
and send the payload
to the Post/appPriceSchedules endpoint.


418
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,052 line:-1
Once I configured my manual prices,


419
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,523 line:-2
the App Store will provide
comparable automatic prices


420
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,392 line:-2
during the times I haven't manually set
a price


421
00:23:45.459 --> 00:23:49.196 line:-2 align:center
for each country or region
other than the base.


422
00:23:49.263 --> 00:23:53.901 line:-2 align:center
In this example, there will be
two automatic prices in Canada,


423
00:23:53.967 --> 00:23:56.837 line:-1 align:center
before and after the promotion,


424
00:23:56.904 --> 00:23:59.339 line:-1 align:center
and one automatic price per region


425
00:23:59.406 --> 00:24:03.577 line:-1 align:center
in the rest of 173 countries or regions.


426
00:24:04,378 --> 00:24:08,815 line:-2
That's how to manage manual prices
by region in App Store Connect!


427
00:24:08.882 --> 00:24:11.118 line:-1 align:center
With the new pricing capabilities,


428
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:13,987 line:-2
managing pricing for your products
in the App Store


429
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:15,656 line:-1
will be much easier.


430
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:16,857 line:-1
Over to you, Chong!


431
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,026 line:-1
Thanks, Claire!


432
00:24:19.092 --> 00:24:21.461 line:-2 align:center
And that's it
for the advanced pricing tools


433
00:24:21.528 --> 00:24:23.397 line:-1 align:center
for managing pricing by region.


434
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:27,134 line:-1
The App Store's new pricing capabilities


435
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:31.238 line:-2 align:center
provides you with remarkable flexibility
and control.


436
00:24:31.305 --> 00:24:34.741 line:-2 align:center
This enables you to create
tailored pricing strategies


437
00:24:34.808 --> 00:24:36.910 line:-1 align:center
that meet the needs of your users


438
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:39,246 line:-1
and offer an even better experience


439
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:40,848 line:-1
to the users around the globe.


440
00:24:41.682 --> 00:24:43.617 line:-1 align:center
As our wrap-up, I'd like to share


441
00:24:43.684 --> 00:24:46.420 line:-1 align:center
some useful pricing tips.


442
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:50,524 line:-2
First, we've expanded
the number of price points available,


443
00:24:50.591 --> 00:24:53.293 line:-1 align:center
offering you more regional pricing options


444
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.195 line:-1 align:center
and flexibility.


445
00:24:55.262 --> 00:24:58.398 line:-2 align:center
I encourage you to explore
these new price point


446
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:01,435 line:-2
to find the best pricing option
for your business.


447
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:04,938 line:-1
However, I also highly advise


448
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,407 line:-1
carefully reviewing all the price changes,


449
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:09,610 line:-1
including autogenerated prices,


450
00:25:09.676 --> 00:25:12.346 line:-2 align:center
before they become effective
for your customers.


451
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:17,050 line:-2
Additionally, for all the apps
and in-app purchases


452
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:20,053 line:-1
created before March 9 of this year,


453
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,323 line:-2
the United States is set
as default base region.


454
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:27,327 line:-2
I recommend reviewing
your base region settings


455
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:29,363 line:-1
for your apps and in-app purchases


456
00:25:29.429 --> 00:25:30.631 line:-1 align:center
in App Store Connect


457
00:25:30.697 --> 00:25:32.833 line:-1 align:center
and configuring them as needed.


458
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.837 line:-2 align:center
However, keep in mind that changing
the base region


459
00:25:36.904 --> 00:25:39.606 line:-1 align:center
will reset the existing price schedules.


460
00:25:40.541 --> 00:25:44.044 line:-2 align:center
Therefore, it is crucial
to carefully review the changes


461
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:48,115 line:-2
to ensure all the pricing configurations
are set as expected.


462
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:52,719 line:-1
Finally, with the recent 2.3 release


463
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:54,855 line:-1
of the App Store Connect APIs,


464
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:58,992 line:-2
we have introduced a new set
of pricing APIs.


465
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:01,261 line:-2
To accommodate
the new pricing capabilities


466
00:26:01.328 --> 00:26:03.230 line:-1 align:center
in the App Store Connect APIs,


467
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:05,933 line:-2
we needed to phase out
some older APIs


468
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:08,302 line:-1
related to app pricing.


469
00:26:08.368 --> 00:26:11.672 line:-2 align:center
Although you can continue using
the deprecated APIs,


470
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,274 line:-1
we intend to retire them later this year.


471
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:17,978 line:-1
As a result, I strongly recommend


472
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:20,080 line:-1
transitioning to the new APIs


473
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:23,650 line:-2
to take full advantage
of the advanced pricing capabilities


474
00:26:23.717 --> 00:26:25.185 line:-1 align:center
and expanded price points.


475
00:26:26.053 --> 00:26:29.056 line:-2 align:center
We are thrilled
about these new pricing capabilities,


476
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:32,659 line:-2
and we look forward to seeing
how you take advantage of them.


477
00:26:32.726 --> 00:26:34.328 line:-1 align:center
Thanks for watching.
