Hi, welcome to "Discover Quick
Look for spatial computing."


5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,315 line:-1
My name is Youssef,
and I'm an engineer


6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,017 line:-1
on the AR Quick Look team.


7
00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.686 line:-1 position:50%
Today, I'll be talking to you
about all of the capabilities


8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,422 line:-1
of Quick Look on xrOS
and how you can use it


9
00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.626 line:-1 position:50%
to unlock new experiences
for your apps and websites


10
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,094 line:-1
on the platform.


11
00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:28.428 line:-1 position:50%
Before we get into all of that,


12
00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.931 line:-1 position:50%
let's first go over
what Quick Look is.


13
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,999 line:-1
Quick Look is a system
framework that allows you


14
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:39,673 line:-1
to easily preview and edit files
on iOS, macOS, and now xrOS.


15
00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.642 line:-1 position:50%
Quick Look comes
with powerful editing features


16
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,810 line:-1
like trimming for videos
and Markup


17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,347 line:-1
for PDFs and images
right out of the box.


18
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,584 line:-1
It also handles the secure
and safe access of files,


19
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,486 line:-1
so you don't have to worry
about opening up


20
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,689 line:-1
untrusted files in your app.


21
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,293 line:-1
Quick Look shows up in many
places across Apple's platforms.


22
00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:02.062 line:-1 position:50%
On iOS, you see it whenever
you open an attachment


23
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,064 line:-1
from a message thread.


24
00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.767 line:-1 position:50%
On macOS, you enter Quick Look
whenever you hit the Space bar


25
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:10,504 line:-1
on a selected file
from Finder or desktop.


26
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:14,608 line:-1
Quick Look is the system viewer
for file-backed content on xrOS.


27
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:18,412 line:-1
And just like on iOS and macOS,
xrOS apps can leverage


28
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:21.481 line:-1 position:50%
Quick Look to easily gain
feature-rich file viewing


29
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,916 line:-1
and editing.


30
00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.751 line:-1 position:50%
Let's see what that looks like.


31
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,521 line:-1
Recently, I've been working
on remodeling an apartment,


32
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,556 line:-1
and I've been using an app
to track the progress


33
00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:32.793 line:-1 position:50%
of that project
and collaborate with my team.


34
00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:34.728 line:-1 position:50%
One of the interior designers
I'm working with


35
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:38,765 line:-1
just sent me a folder with
some ideas he has for the house.


36
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,300 line:-1
I have that folder
opened up here


37
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.602 line:-1 position:50%
so let's see
what he came up with.


38
00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.371 line:-1 position:50%
It looks like
there's a USDZ model


39
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,139 line:-1
of the proposed living room.


40
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,574 line:-1
Let's open it up.


41
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,043 line:-1
To do this, I'll pinch
and drag the file out


42
00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.113 line:-1 position:50%
and drop it outside
of any application.


43
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.985 line:-1 position:50%
Dropping the USDZ file presents
a 3D Quick Look preview


44
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:01,021 line:-1
right where I dropped it.


45
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,291 line:-1
And I can immediately start
to interact with it.


46
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.860 line:-1 position:50%
Using a pinch and drag gesture,
I can rotate the model


47
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.464 line:-1 position:50%
to get a better look at the
beautiful exposed brick facade.


48
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,399 line:-1
To take a closer look
at the living room,


49
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:16,336 line:-1
I'll just zoom into the model
to scale it up.


50
00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.305 line:-1 position:50%
It looks like my designer
also sent a picture


51
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:23,143 line:-1
of the neighborhood
surrounding the home.


52
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,112 line:-1
Finally, it looks like
there's a document here


53
00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:27.948 line:-1 position:50%
with a list of the features
planned for the home.


54
00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:29.716 line:-1 position:50%
A lot of these look great
but I'm not sure


55
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,151 line:-1
about this last one,


56
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,453 line:-1
so let me leave a note
to get back to it later.


57
00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.555 line:-1 position:50%
I'll open up the menu
at the top of the window


58
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,890 line:-1
and select Markup,


59
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.860 line:-1 position:50%
which brings up
the Markup palette.


60
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.496 line:-1 position:50%
Let me quickly circle the item
I want to get back to.


61
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,902 line:-1
We were able to drag a file
from an application


62
00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:51.605 line:-1 position:50%
and preview it
outside of that app.


63
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,041 line:-1
We did this with multiple files
and viewed them all


64
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,476 line:-1
alongside
the source application.


65
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,512 line:-1
This new way to present files
in Quick Look


66
00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.547 line:-1 position:50%
is called Windowed Quick Look.


67
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,115 line:-1
In this session,
we'll learn more


68
00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.617 line:-1 position:50%
about this presentation style


69
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,787 line:-1
and how apps and websites
can adopt it.


70
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,423 line:-1
Then we'll go over how
to present Quick Look previews


71
00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:11.758 line:-1 position:50%
directly within an application.


72
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,996 line:-1
But first, let's take a deeper
dive into Windowed Quick Look.


73
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,632 line:-1
Windowed Quick Look allows you
to present Quick Look previews


74
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,534 line:-1
outside of your application.


75
00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.403 line:-1 position:50%
This is perfect
for nonblocking experiences


76
00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.539 line:-1 position:50%
where you want to be able
to view your file content


77
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,641 line:-1
alongside your app.


78
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,309 line:-1
Since windowed
Quick Look previews


79
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,546 line:-1
are hosted in a separate app,
you can close your application


80
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,482 line:-1
while still having
those previews persist.


81
00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:38.285 line:-1 position:50%
Windowed Quick Look also offers
a much richer viewing experience


82
00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:42.389 line:-1 position:50%
for 3D models backed
by USDZ and Reality files.


83
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,858 line:-1
You can scale and place
3D content independent


84
00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:46.693 line:-1 position:50%
of your application.


85
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,261 line:-1
You can also scale the 3D model


86
00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:50.864 line:-1 position:50%
which will dim the environment
and hide all other scenes,


87
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:54,234 line:-1
allowing you to focus
on just the 3D content.


88
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,236 line:-1
Certain file types presented
in Quick Look windows


89
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,838 line:-1
offer SharePlay experiences


90
00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:01.575 line:-1 position:50%
so you can share a file
and view it over FaceTime.


91
00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.810 line:-1 position:50%
When sharing 3D content
over SharePlay,


92
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,413 line:-1
Quick Look will sync
the 3D model's orientation,


93
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,982 line:-1
scale, and animations.


94
00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.817 line:-1 position:50%
When sharing images
over SharePlay,


95
00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:14.588 line:-1 position:50%
you'll be able to mark up
that image together with others.


96
00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.690 line:-1 position:50%
SharePlaying files
with Quick Look offers you


97
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.192 line:-1 position:50%
an easy and simple way
to collaborate on files


98
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,061 line:-1
with a group.


99
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,430 line:-1
Both applications and websites
can present content


100
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,399 line:-1
in Quick Look windows and take
advantage of the many benefits


101
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,135 line:-1
it has to offer.


102
00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:29.836 line:-1 position:50%
First, let's take
a look at how apps


103
00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:32.372 line:-1 position:50%
can present Windowed Quick Look.


104
00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:34.274 line:-1 position:50%
Apps can present files
in Quick Look windows


105
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,512 line:-1
by providing a drag source
containing some URL.


106
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,413 line:-1
During a drag-and-drop
interaction,


107
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,582 line:-1
when a drop target
is outside of any app,


108
00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:45.886 line:-1 position:50%
the system will copy and present
your provided URL


109
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,954 line:-1
in a Quick Look window.


110
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,323 line:-1
If your provided URL
is pointing to a file


111
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,260 line:-1
hosted in a remote destination,
like iCloud,


112
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.662 line:-1 position:50%
the system will
download it first.


113
00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:57.797 line:-1 position:50%
Keep in mind,
that because a copy


114
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,167 line:-1
of your provided
file is presented,


115
00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:03.970 line:-1 position:50%
any edits such as markups on an
image made to the presented file


116
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.474 line:-1 position:50%
will not be written back
to the URL you provide.


117
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,643 line:-1
To see this in action,
let's go to Xcode.


118
00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.381 line:-1 position:50%
Before we add drag
support to our app,


119
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,083 line:-1
let me quickly give you
an overview of the app.


120
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,486 line:-1
The app lets you see
the progress of the project


121
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,522 line:-1
and view a list of the files
shared by other team members.


122
00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:26.126 line:-1 position:50%
Here we have a list view
which displays FileViews.


123
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,495 line:-1
Since we want to be able
to drag out each file,


124
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.731 line:-1 position:50%
we'll need to turn each FileView
into a drag source.


125
00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:35.969 line:-1 position:50%
To do this, I'll add the onDrag
modifier onto the FileView.


126
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:40,373 line:-1
The onDrag modifier
expects an NSItemProvider,


127
00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:42.909 line:-1 position:50%
so I'll return an item provider
containing the URL


128
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,579 line:-1
for the file being displayed
in that FileView.


129
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,055 line:-1
Building and running
the app in the simulator,


130
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,357 line:-1
I can now drag out
from the file view


131
00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:01.661 line:-1 position:50%
and present that file
in a new Quick Look window.


132
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,029 line:-1
I can also close out my app


133
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,833 line:-1
and still have that
file's preview displayed.


134
00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.335 line:-1 position:50%
By adding just
a few lines of code,


135
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,870 line:-1
I've enabled drag and drop
within my app


136
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,173 line:-1
and allowed content to be
viewed in a separate window


137
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,909 line:-1
letting me still use
my app freely.


138
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.746 line:-1 position:50%
Now let's see how we can
do this for websites.


139
00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:23.450 line:-1 position:50%
Since iOS 12, websites have
been able to link to and view


140
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.620 line:-1 position:50%
3D content in AR Quick Look
on iPhone and iPad


141
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,656 line:-1
by marking up links
with the AR attribute.


142
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,993 line:-1
When you open a link to
marked-up 3D content on xrOS,


143
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,728 line:-1
Safari will present
the 3D content


144
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,896 line:-1
in a new Quick Look window.


145
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,933 line:-1
Websites already supporting
AR content linking on iOS


146
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,936 line:-1
and iPadOS will have
this behavior carry over


147
00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:46.506 line:-1 position:50%
to xrOS with no additional
work needed.


148
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,109 line:-1
xrOS will also respect
customization options


149
00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:51.611 line:-1 position:50%
such as disabling
content scaling.


150
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,980 line:0
For more information on
those customization options,


151
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,182 line:0
see the "Advances
in AR Quick Look" session


152
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,119 position:50%
from WWDC19.


153
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,520 line:-1
If you haven't setup
your website


154
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,389 line:-1
to present 3D content
from Safari,


155
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,725 line:-1
all you have to do is mark up
your links like this.


156
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,662 line:-1
By adding rel="ar" to your link
or anchor element,


157
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,930 line:-1
Safari won't navigate on tap.


158
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,866 line:-1
Instead, it will present
that 3D file


159
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,136 line:-1
in a Quick Look window
alongside the website.


160
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,339 line:-1
Let's go over to Safari
and check this out.


161
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,374 line:-1
We have the AR Quick Look
gallery page


162
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,243 line:-1
open in Safari here.


163
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,612 line:-1
There are a bunch of 3D models
linked to from this page


164
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,415 line:-1
so let's open some of them up.


165
00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:30.250 line:-1 position:50%
Tapping on a link
to this teapot,


166
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,888 line:-1
downloads and presents that 3D
model in a Quick Look window.


167
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,824 line:-1
Once it downloads,
the model will appear.


168
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,460 line:-1
Tapping on the link to this mug
presents it near the teapot


169
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,028 line:-1
and Safari.


170
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,830 line:-1
This is really great
for e-commerce sites


171
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.799 line:-1 position:50%
where you might want
to view and place products


172
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:50,537 line:-1
in shared space to get
a sense if it's right for you.


173
00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:52.072 line:-1 position:50%
We just went over
presenting files


174
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,308 line:-1
in a Quick Look window
to preview it outside your app.


175
00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.044 line:-1 position:50%
There are some use cases where
you may want to preview files


176
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,313 line:-1
directly inside of your app.


177
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,816 line:-1
Displaying in-app
Quick Look content is as simple


178
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,785 line:-1
as passing in some URLs
to the quickLookPreview function


179
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,620 line:-1
in SwiftUI.


180
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,622 line:-1
When presented using
quickLookPreview,


181
00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:11.491 line:-1 position:50%
the preview will display
as a sheet


182
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,727 line:-1
on top of your view's content.


183
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,495 line:-1
If you want more
customization options


184
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,464 line:-1
over your presented previews,
you can use


185
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,266 line:-1
a QLPreviewController
here instead.


186
00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.969 line:-1 position:50%
If you're bringing
your iOS app to xrOS,


187
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,804 line:-1
existing uses
of quickLookPreview


188
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:29,442 line:-1
or QLPreviewController API
will carry over for free.


189
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,277 line:-1
Let's hop over
to the simulator and see


190
00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:35.648 line:-1 position:50%
where we could take advantage of
this in our Project Tracker app.


191
00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:38.551 line:-1 position:50%
I have a view where I can review
some new designs my team has


192
00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:41.821 line:-1 position:50%
before sending them off
to the homeowner for approval.


193
00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.790 line:-1 position:50%
I can currently see
a list of files,


194
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,626 line:-1
but I can't actually preview
any of the files.


195
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,562 line:-1
Let's go to Xcode
and see if we can fix this.


196
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,564 line:-1
This is my view right now.


197
00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:54.367 line:-1 position:50%
To preview the files directly
in my application,


198
00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:58.405 line:-1 position:50%
first I'll import QuickLook.


199
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,207 position:50%
Then I'll add the SwiftUI
quickLookPreview function


200
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,209 position:50%
passing all of the files
I want to preview


201
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,112 position:50%
and the specific file
I want initially selected.


202
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.822 line:-1 position:50%
Let's run this
and see what we get.


203
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,494 line:-1
Going back to our app,
now when I select this view,


204
00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.196 line:-1 position:50%
I can see a sheet
with our previews


205
00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:26.566 line:-1 position:50%
appear directly within our app.


206
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,968 line:-1
I can cycle through the files
using the navigation controls


207
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,504 line:-1
in the toolbar and make sure
everything is fine


208
00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:34.274 line:-1 position:50%
before sending them over
to the homeowner.


209
00:09:34.274 --> 00:09:36.376 line:-1 position:50%
Presenting file previews
directly within our app


210
00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:38.445 line:-1 position:50%
was as easy as passing
in some URLs


211
00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:41.614 line:-1 position:50%
to the quickLookPreview
function.


212
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,716 line:-1
Now that we've covered
both flavors of Quick Look


213
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,951 line:-1
on the platform,


214
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,321 line:-1
let's touch on the file types
with supported previews.


215
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,423 line:-1
Quick Look supports
the most common file types


216
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:56,596 line:-1
including images, videos,
PDFs, and USDZ files.


217
00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.932 line:-1 position:50%
Spatial images and videos
shown in Quick Look


218
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,302 line:-1
will look just as stunning
as they do in Photos.


219
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:05,238 line:-1
And that's a quick look
at Quick Look on xrOS.


220
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:09,008 line:-1
Now let's recap all
we went over today.


221
00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:11.411 line:-1 position:50%
We talked about the rich preview
and editing features


222
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,713 line:-1
that Quick Look
can provide apps.


223
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,482 line:-1
We then discussed
Windowed Quick Look,


224
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,151 line:-1
a new way for apps to preview
content using Quick Look,


225
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.019 line:-1 position:50%
and the capabilities
that Windowed Quick Look


226
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,856 line:-1
has to offer,
such as multipreview support


227
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,693 line:-1
so you can view content
alongside your application,


228
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:29,896 line:-1
volumetric immersive
3D content viewing,


229
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,165 line:-1
and SharePlay support.


230
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,467 line:-1
We then went over how
applications can streamline


231
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,270 line:-1
their workflows and take
advantage of Quick Look windows


232
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,806 line:-1
by adding support
for drag and drop,


233
00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.774 line:-1 position:50%
and how websites can leverage
Quick Look windows


234
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:46,379 line:-1
to present 3D content
alongside Safari as well.


235
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,882 line:-1
We also saw how simple
it was for apps to present


236
00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:52.819 line:-1 position:50%
Quick Look content within
their own scenes in SwiftUI.


237
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.388 line:-1 position:50%
If you're bringing an app
that already uses Quick Look,


238
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,956 line:-1
you'll have to do
little to no work


239
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,226 line:-1
to get a great Quick Look
experience on this platform.


240
00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:03.196 line:-1 position:50%
Similarly, websites already
linking to AR content


241
00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:06.599 line:-1 position:50%
will have that behavior
carry over for free as well.


242
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,836 line:-1
Quick Look can provide apps
with simple, powerful,


243
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,472 line:-1
and secure file-viewing
experiences,


244
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,941 line:-1
and we can't wait to see what
you build using Quick Look


245
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,342 line:-1
on xrOS.
