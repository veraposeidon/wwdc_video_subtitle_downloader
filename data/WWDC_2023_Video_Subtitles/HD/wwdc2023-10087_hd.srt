Willem Mattelaer:
Hi, my name is Willem,


5
00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.748 line:-1 position:50%
and I'm an engineer
working on group activities.


6
00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.216 line:-1 position:50%
I'll be joined by Mia
to talk about


7
00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:19.653 line:-1 position:50%
how you can build great
spatial SharePlay apps.


8
00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:22.623 line:-1 position:50%
SharePlay has always been
about being present with others


9
00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:26.360 line:-1 position:50%
and doing something together,
whether nearby or far apart.


10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,728 line:-1
On this platform,
we can increase


11
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,697 line:-1
the feeling of being present
while in FaceTime.


12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,634 line:-1
In FaceTime on this platform,
all Spatial Personas


13
00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:35.936 line:-1 position:50%
will take up a physical space
in your room


14
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,538 line:-1
instead of being constrained
to a single window.


15
00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:42.509 line:-1 position:50%
This increases the feeling
of being together with others.


16
00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.712 line:-1 position:50%
On top of this,
we introduce shared context.


17
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,381 position:50%
Shared context
means that everyone


18
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,717 position:50%
will see everyone else in
the same relative position.


19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,820 position:50%
To illustrate this, consider
two different perspectives.


20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,023 position:50%
The left side shows
Connor's perspective,


21
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,092 position:50%
and the right side shows Mia's.


22
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,595 position:50%
If Connor points to
the Persona of Mia,


23
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:05,332 line:0
Mia will see Connor's
Persona pointing to her.


24
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,434 position:50%
We extend this
to shared experiences,


25
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,603 position:50%
including SharePlay,
where the system will


26
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:13,373 line:0
place the window in the same
relative position for everyone.


27
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,076 line:0
It uses templates for this.


28
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,211 position:50%
Templates are used
to determine how participants


29
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,515 line:0
and a shared app will be
arranged relative to each other.


30
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,418 line:0
This will lead
to spatial consistency.


31
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,687 position:50%
Apps don't need to handle
displacement themselves


32
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,189 line:0
and can rely
on the system for this.


33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,124 line:-1
One thing that apps
should worry about


34
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,360 line:-1
is having visual consistency.


35
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.295 line:-1 position:50%
Visual consistency
means that everyone


36
00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:38.165 line:-1 position:50%
is seeing the same content
inside the app.


37
00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:41.134 line:-1 position:50%
Imagine being in front
of a whiteboard with others.


38
00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.603 line:-1 position:50%
Everyone will have the same view
of the whiteboard.


39
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,839 line:-1
And whenever someone
points to something,


40
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,475 line:-1
the others can see
what they're pointing at.


41
00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.978 line:-1 position:50%
We want to replicate this
in spatial experiences


42
00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:53.347 line:-1 position:50%
with SharePlay.


43
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,549 position:50%
Bringing it back
to our earlier example,


44
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,986 position:50%
here the app doesn't
have visual consistency.


45
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,054 line:0
If Connor points to
the square in the app,


46
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,024 line:0
Mia will see Connor's
Persona point to the circle.


47
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:07,194 line:0
This breaks the illusion
of being together.


48
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:10,030 position:50%
However, if the app
had visual consistency,


49
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,431 line:0
Mia would clearly
see that Connor


50
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,467 position:50%
was pointing to the square.


51
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,102 position:50%
It's the responsibility
of the app


52
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,937 position:50%
to keep the content
and its placement


53
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,206 line:0
in sync for all participants.


54
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,209 line:0
This way, it feels like everyone
is looking at the exact same app


55
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,045 position:50%
as if they were really together.


56
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,781 line:0
In the "Design spatial SharePlay
experiences" session,


57
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,283 position:50%
we go in a lot more detail
on these concepts.


58
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,084 position:50%
I strongly encourage you


59
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,021 position:50%
to watch that session
to learn more.


60
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.356 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we've gone over
some of the new concepts


61
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,026 line:-1
that are introduced with
FaceTime on this platform,


62
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,461 line:-1
let's dive into what a
windowed app should consider


63
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.997 line:-1 position:50%
when adopting SharePlay,
and what additional steps


64
00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.500 line:-1 position:50%
an existing iOS SharePlay app
should take


65
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,337 line:-1
to elevate their experience
when used in a spatial setting.


66
00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.672 line:-1 position:50%
Afterwards, Mia will show you
the new APIs


67
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,777 line:-1
to make incredible immersive
SharePlay experiences.


68
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,612 line:-1
To support SharePlay
in windowed apps,


69
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:03,116 line:-1
we've added the new system
coordinator for group sessions.


70
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,219 line:-1
System coordinator
is responsible for two things:


71
00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.289 line:-1 position:50%
receiving system state
for the active SharePlay session,


72
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,858 line:-1
and letting you provide
additional configurations


73
00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.660 line:-1 position:50%
during SharePlay.


74
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.828 line:-1 position:50%
I'll cover two of these


75
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,731 line:-1
which are relevant for both
windowed and immersive apps:


76
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:21,902 line:-1
the isSpatial flag
and template preferences.


77
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,604 line:-1
Knowing if a participant
is spatial or not is important


78
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,408 line:-1
when determining the required
level of visual consistency.


79
00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:29.109 line:-1 position:50%
For instance,


80
00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.645 line:-1 position:50%
here we have Connor's
first-person perspective.


81
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,780 line:-1
He's in a call with Mia in red,


82
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.451 line:-1 position:50%
looking at a document
that I shared with SharePlay.


83
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,886 line:-1
Mia's perspective of this
scenario is on the right,


84
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,390 line:-1
where she sees Connor in blue.


85
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,391 line:-1
When Connor scrolls,


86
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,960 line:-1
we would want to synchronize
the scroll position.


87
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.196 line:-1 position:50%
That way,
Mia will see Connor scroll


88
00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:51.565 line:-1 position:50%
and we still have
visual consistency.


89
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,568 line:-1
We actually do this when panning
in a Freeform document


90
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,937 line:-1
while in SharePlay.


91
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,139 line:-1
But if you're not spatial,
you don't have the context


92
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,675 line:-1
of the other person
interacting with the document.


93
00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:04.277 line:-1 position:50%
So if Connor would scroll,
we shouldn't sync that,


94
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:09,049 line:-1
and Mia will keep seeing
the document at the same spot.


95
00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.551 line:-1 position:50%
To observe if the local
participant is spatial,


96
00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:14.387 line:-1 position:50%
and adjust what you're syncing
between participants,


97
00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:16.123 line:-1 position:50%
you first need to get
the system coordinator


98
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,358 line:-1
for the group session.


99
00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.760 line:-1 position:50%
You can know if the local
participant is spatial


100
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.898 line:-1 position:50%
by checking if isSpatial is true
on the local participant state.


101
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:25,999 line:-1
To observe the state,


102
00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.468 line:-1 position:50%
you can use the
localParticipantState property,


103
00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.637 line:-1 position:50%
which returns an async sequence
that will iterate


104
00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:33.640 line:-1 position:50%
through updates
of the local participant state.


105
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.475 line:-1 position:50%
The system coordinator
also offers apps


106
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,178 line:-1
a way to provide
a template preference.


107
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:41,214 line:-1
Templates are used to determine
how all participants are placed


108
00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:43.517 line:-1 position:50%
by the system
relative to the app


109
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,620 line:-1
to establish
spatial consistency.


110
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.788 line:-1 position:50%
We support
three different templates.


111
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,291 line:-1
Side-by-Side, we'll place
all participants in an arc


112
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.193 line:-1 position:50%
facing towards the shared app.


113
00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:55.328 line:-1 position:50%
This is the default template
that will be applied


114
00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:59.032 line:-1 position:50%
when the app is using
a regular windows scene.


115
00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.467 line:-1 position:50%
In the Conversational template,


116
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,036 line:-1
all participants are
placed in a half circle,


117
00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:05.672 line:-1 position:50%
with the app placed
in front of that half circle.


118
00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:07.908 line:-1 position:50%
This is great for experiences
where the focus


119
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,743 line:-1
isn't on the content in the app.


120
00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:13.280 line:-1 position:50%
For instance,
when playing music in SharePlay.


121
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,549 line:-1
Lastly, we have
the Surround template.


122
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,484 line:-1
This places the participants
in a circle,


123
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.420 line:-1 position:50%
and the app is put
in the center of the circle.


124
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.788 line:-1 position:50%
This template is only available


125
00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:24.925 line:-1 position:50%
when the app is using
a volumetric scene.


126
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,893 line:-1
The distance between
the participants and the app


127
00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:29.062 line:-1 position:50%
is based on the size of the app.


128
00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:30.263 line:-1 position:50%
If the app is bigger,


129
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,532 line:-1
it will be placed
further from the people.


130
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:36,369 line:-1
And if the app is smaller,
it will get placed closer.


131
00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:38.572 line:-1 position:50%
A SharePlay app can provide
a template preference


132
00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:40.607 line:-1 position:50%
through the system coordinator.


133
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,175 line:-1
FaceTime will try
to apply this template


134
00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.511 line:-1 position:50%
while the group session
is active.


135
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.847 line:-1 position:50%
There are three preferences
available for SharePlay apps.


136
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,517 line:-1
.none, which will follow
the system default behavior,


137
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,586 line:-1
where it will be Side-by-Side
for vertical apps


138
00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:54.554 line:-1 position:50%
and Surround
for volumetric ones.


139
00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:57.991 line:-1 position:50%
This is the default preference
that will be used.


140
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,125 line:-1
There is also .sideBySide


141
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,261 line:-1
which will try to apply
the Side-by-Side template,


142
00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:03.530 line:-1 position:50%
no matter
what kind of app it is.


143
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.498 line:-1 position:50%
And finally,
there is .conversational,


144
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,602 line:-1
which will try to apply
the corresponding template.


145
00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:10.303 line:-1 position:50%
To configure
the template preference,


146
00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:12.072 line:-1 position:50%
you just need to set it
on the configuration


147
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,441 line:-1
of the system coordinator
before calling join


148
00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:16.610 line:-1 position:50%
on the group session.


149
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,212 line:-1
Templates are used
to place the app and participant


150
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,648 line:-1
in an optimal position
for the experience.


151
00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:23.750 line:-1 position:50%
But what if your app
has multiple window scenes


152
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.653 line:-1 position:50%
and there is more than one
currently foregrounded?


153
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,856 line:-1
In this example, we have
an app with three scenes.


154
00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:32.359 line:-1 position:50%
Seen on the left
is a browse view.


155
00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:34.461 line:-1 position:50%
The small scene in the middle
provides an easy way


156
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,596 line:-1
to navigate through the content.


157
00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:38.932 line:-1 position:50%
And the last scene
provides detailed information


158
00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:41.401 line:-1 position:50%
about one piece of content.


159
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.703 line:-1 position:50%
All of these scenes
can be open at the same time,


160
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,672 line:-1
so you can easily
navigate the content


161
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,774 line:-1
while reading about it.


162
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:48,642 line:-1
When in SharePlay,


163
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,111 line:-1
we want the detail scene
to be the shared scene.


164
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.445 line:-1 position:50%
But if all of them are open,


165
00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.814 line:-1 position:50%
the wrong scene
could be used in the template.


166
00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:57.851 line:-1 position:50%
To solve that,
we've added scene association.


167
00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:00.887 line:-1 position:50%
This is a way for the system
to know which scene of the app


168
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,189 line:-1
is hosting
the SharePlay activity.


169
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,293 line:-1
There are two reasons
we need to know this.


170
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,095 line:-1
First, it allows the Share menu
above a window


171
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,032 line:-1
to show to the person
which scene is shared.


172
00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:15.302 line:-1 position:50%
This is a helpful indicator when
there are multiple windows open


173
00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:17.971 line:-1 position:50%
and will help prevent possible
embarrassing situations


174
00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:20.407 line:-1 position:50%
where someone was accidentally
interacting with a shared window


175
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,809 line:-1
without realizing it.


176
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,712 line:-1
More importantly, however,
it determines which window scene


177
00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.515 line:-1 position:50%
will be used with the template.


178
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,450 line:-1
If your app
is a single-scene app,


179
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,619 line:-1
you don't need
to worry about this.


180
00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:34.921 line:-1 position:50%
Since there's only ever
one scene possible,


181
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,923 line:-1
we will automatically
associate that scene


182
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,491 line:-1
with the group session.


183
00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:41.127 line:-1 position:50%
However, multiscene apps
will need to consider this


184
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,263 line:-1
when adopting SharePlay.


185
00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:46.299 line:-1 position:50%
If not adopted, a random
open scene will be selected,


186
00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.535 line:-1 position:50%
and it might not be
the right one.


187
00:07:48.535 --> 00:07:52.706 line:-1 position:50%
Let's go over how you can
adopt scene association.


188
00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:53.973 line:-1 position:50%
We'll start by looking
at what happens


189
00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:57.110 line:-1 position:50%
for the person who started
the SharePlay activity.


190
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,346 line:-1
When the group activity
gets activated,


191
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,947 line:-1
we'll go through
each of the scenes


192
00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:04.517 line:-1 position:50%
and check which scene
can handle this.


193
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,287 line:0
We do that by evaluating
the scene activation conditions


194
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,957 line:0
against the activity identifier
of the group activity.


195
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,626 line:0
Scene activation conditions
consist of two checks,


196
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,329 position:50%
can and prefers.


197
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,265 line:0
Can indicates that the scene
could potentially handle it,


198
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,801 line:0
while prefers will help
direct it to a scene


199
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,504 line:0
that is more ideally
suited for it.


200
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,006 line:0
So we'll start by checking
the scene on the left


201
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,008 line:0
to see if it can
or prefers to handle


202
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,077 line:0
the activity identifier.


203
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,646 position:50%
It can but doesn't prefer.


204
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,850 line:0
Next, we'll check
the middle scene, which can't.


205
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,385 position:50%
Finally, we'll check
the last scene,


206
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,954 position:50%
which both can and prefers.


207
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,490 position:50%
Since the last scene can
and is the preferred one,


208
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,093 line:0
we'll associate it
with the group session.


209
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,529 line:0
If no scene could handle
the identifier,


210
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,731 line:0
we will launch
a new window scene.


211
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,666 position:50%
This is great
if your SharePlay experience


212
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,302 position:50%
requires its own scene
to work in.


213
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,705 position:50%
If multiple scenes can
handle and none prefer,


214
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,375 position:50%
then one of those scenes
will be randomly picked.


215
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,778 line:-1
For the participants that didn't
activate the group activity


216
00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:06.045 line:-1 position:50%
and are receiving it,


217
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,482 line:-1
the same logic will execute
if the app is already running.


218
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,750 line:-1
If your app is not running,


219
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,687 line:-1
it will get launched and the
first scene will be associated.


220
00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:17.023 line:-1 position:50%
To specify scene activation
conditions for an app


221
00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:19.426 line:-1 position:50%
that uses the SwiftUI
app lifecycle,


222
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,595 line:-1
you can use
handlesExternalEvents.


223
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,398 line:-1
Just include the activity
identifier of the group activity


224
00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:29.002 line:-1 position:50%
in either the preferring
or allowing set of strings.


225
00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:31.371 line:-1 position:50%
If your app uses
the UIKit app life cycle,


226
00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:33.940 line:-1 position:50%
you can set the activation
conditions on the UI scene


227
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.609 line:-1 position:50%
by specifying predicates.


228
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,179 position:50%
To learn more about
scene activation conditions,


229
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,282 line:0
check out this session
from 2019.


230
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,451 line:-1
Let's consider one more example.


231
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,286 line:-1
In this case,
it's a document-based app


232
00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:49.422 line:-1 position:50%
where each scene represents
a different document.


233
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,523 line:-1
Now we want to use SharePlay


234
00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:53.326 line:-1 position:50%
to collaborate
on the first document.


235
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,595 line:-1
We'll again use
the group activity identifier


236
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,065 line:-1
to evaluate each of the scene's
activation conditions.


237
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,134 line:-1
Unfortunately,
there isn't anything


238
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,269 line:-1
inherently different
about these scenes,


239
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.671 line:-1 position:50%
so they all end up matching


240
00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:07.707 line:-1 position:50%
and the wrong scene
gets associated.


241
00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:09.876 line:-1 position:50%
In this case, we want
to change the identifier


242
00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:11.945 line:-1 position:50%
that is used
to match scenes with.


243
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:15.915 line:-1 position:50%
To accomplish this, we've added
scene association behavior.


244
00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:18.151 line:-1 position:50%
This allows an app
to provide an identifier


245
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,120 line:-1
that will be used
to find the right scene.


246
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.522 line:-1 position:50%
Going back to our example,


247
00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:24.824 line:-1 position:50%
we could use a unique identifier
of each document


248
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,560 line:-1
that all participants agree on.


249
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.997 line:-1 position:50%
We'll then use that identifier
to find the right scene.


250
00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:32.565 line:-1 position:50%
If we evaluate the scenes now,


251
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,301 line:-1
we can easily configure
the scene activation conditions


252
00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.036 line:-1 position:50%
so only the first scene
is matched,


253
00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:40.240 line:-1 position:50%
and we'll end up with
the right scene association.


254
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,675 line:-1
You can specify the identifier
that will be used


255
00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:44.677 line:-1 position:50%
by setting
the scene association behavior


256
00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:47.647 line:-1 position:50%
on the metadata
of your group activity.


257
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,916 line:-1
Keep in mind that the same
identifier will be used


258
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,986 line:-1
for all other participants
that join the SharePlay session.


259
00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:56.923 line:-1 position:50%
So you want to use something
that everyone will agree on.


260
00:10:56.923 --> 00:11:00.193 line:-1 position:50%
We support three types
of scene association behavior.


261
00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:02.729 line:-1 position:50%
Default is the behavior
we looked at first,


262
00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:05.365 line:-1 position:50%
where the identifier that is
used to associate the scene


263
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,967 line:-1
will be the group
activity identifier.


264
00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:10.537 line:-1 position:50%
As the name indicates,
this is a default behavior


265
00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:13.239 line:-1 position:50%
if you don't
explicitly specify one.


266
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,843 line:-1
Content behavior allows you
to specify a custom identifier.


267
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,745 line:-1
This is meant for apps
where each of the scenes


268
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,246 line:-1
will show different content,


269
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,750 line:-1
and the group activity
is tied to that content.


270
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,119 line:-1
Finally, we offer
the none behavior.


271
00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:29.222 line:-1 position:50%
The none behavior will disable
scene association.


272
00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:31.457 line:-1 position:50%
This means that no scene
will be associated,


273
00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:33.226 line:-1 position:50%
so the person won't see
the shared banner


274
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,728 line:-1
above any of the scenes
of your app.


275
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,998 line:-1
It also means that spatial
consistency is broken.


276
00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:41.367 line:-1 position:50%
This should only be used
in specific cases,


277
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.404 line:-1 position:50%
such as immersive apps that
don't need an additional scene,


278
00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:47.173 line:-1 position:50%
or in cases where the content
that is displayed in the scene


279
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,108 line:-1
is different
for each participant


280
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,945 line:-1
in the SharePlay session.


281
00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:53.646 line:-1 position:50%
Sometimes you might need
to know what scene


282
00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:56.082 line:-1 position:50%
a group session
is associated with.


283
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,251 line:-1
This might happen if multiple
scenes could potentially


284
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,054 line:-1
be selected for
scene association.


285
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,756 position:50%
To get this information,
we exposed a new property


286
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,293 position:50%
on the group session
called sceneSessionIdentifier.


287
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,963 line:0
This property will include the
identifier of the scene session


288
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:13,866 position:50%
that was associated
with the group session.


289
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,368 line:-1
Scene association is crucial


290
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,737 line:-1
to build great SharePlay
experiences,


291
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:18.938 line:-1 position:50%
so definitely apply it


292
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,975 line:-1
if you have an app that
supports multiple scenes.


293
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,411 line:-1
Finally, let's talk about
SharePlay from the Share menu.


294
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.848 line:-1 position:50%
When in FaceTime, every window
has a share banner above it.


295
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,351 line:-1
As we just saw, it will indicate
which scene is shared


296
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,019 line:-1
while in SharePlay.


297
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,822 line:-1
But it's also useful
when not in SharePlay.


298
00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:37.223 line:-1 position:50%
When a scene is not shared,


299
00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:41.294 line:-1 position:50%
it will show different ways
that that scene can be shared.


300
00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:43.896 line:-1 position:50%
One option is to simply
share the window.


301
00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:46.032 line:-1 position:50%
Everyone else will see
a noninteractive video feed


302
00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:47.400 line:-1 position:50%
of the window.


303
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.836 line:-1 position:50%
This works out of the box
for all apps.


304
00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:53.373 line:-1 position:50%
A SharePlay app can take
this further, however.


305
00:12:53.373 --> 00:12:55.875 line:-1 position:50%
By exposing a group activity
that is relevant


306
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,977 line:-1
to the current content
of the window,


307
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,446 line:-1
it will get surfaced
in that menu.


308
00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:02.782 line:-1 position:50%
This is a great way
to improve the discoverability


309
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,451 line:-1
of your SharePlay activity
and can also remove the need


310
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:09.389 line:-1 position:50%
to have a dedicated SharePlay
button in your app's UI.


311
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,391 line:-1
The way an app exposes
the group activity


312
00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:15.294 line:-1 position:50%
is done through the same way as
starting SharePlay via AirDrop.


313
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,864 line:-1
In iOS 17, you can start
SharePlay via AirDrop


314
00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:20.566 line:-1 position:50%
by having a SharePlay app open.


315
00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.301 line:-1 position:50%
To fetch the group activity,


316
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,570 line:-1
the system goes through
the UI responder chain


317
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,673 line:-1
of the scene
that is being shown


318
00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:29.409 line:-1 position:50%
and tries to find a group
activity that is specified


319
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,377 line:-1
in the activity items
configuration


320
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,546 line:-1
of one of the responders.


321
00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:35.415 line:-1 position:50%
That way you can just set
the group activity


322
00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:37.617 line:-1 position:50%
on the activity items
configuration


323
00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:41.087 line:-1 position:50%
of a view controller that is
showing SharePlayable content,


324
00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:44.190 line:-1 position:50%
and it will get
picked up automatically.


325
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,292 line:-1
To configure the Activity Items
configuration,


326
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,696 line:-1
you start by creating the
activity that can be activated.


327
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,731 line:-1
Next you'll create
an item provider


328
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,333 line:-1
and register
the group activity on it.


329
00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:57.303 line:-1 position:50%
You then initialize the
UIActivityItemsConfiguration


330
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,872 line:-1
with the item provider.


331
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,174 position:50%
Finally, you'll need
to make sure


332
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,943 position:50%
that the configuration exposes
the right metadata,


333
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,113 position:50%
since that is what will be
presented in the Share menu.


334
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,649 position:50%
To do that, you can use
the metadataProvider


335
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,984 position:50%
on UIActivityItemsConfiguration


336
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,153 line:0
and provide
an LPLinkMetadata object


337
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,789 line:0
for the LinkPresentationMetadata
key.


338
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,893 line:0
The title and image provider
will be used in the Share menu.


339
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,296 position:50%
All of this will also work
if you use your own class


340
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:27,166 position:50%
that conforms to UIActivityItems
Configuration reading.


341
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,535 line:-1
I just covered what you
will need to consider


342
00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:33.272 line:-1 position:50%
when building windowed SharePlay
experiences for this platform.


343
00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.575 line:-1 position:50%
Mia, can you walk us through
how to build shared experiences


344
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,176 line:-1
for immersive apps?


345
00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:38.745 line:-1 position:50%
Mia Ren: No problem, Willem.


346
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,513 line:-1
Now let's check out
how SharePlay works


347
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,315 line:-1
for immersive apps.


348
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,384 line:-1
On this platform, we can easily
create immersive experiences


349
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,553 line:-1
using Immersive Space.


350
00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.789 line:-1 position:50%
Immersive Space
is a special scene


351
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,858 line:-1
that allows an app
to make its contents


352
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:55,828 line:-1
go beyond boundaries
with different immersion styles.


353
00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:57.830 line:-1 position:50%
When the app opens
an Immersive Space,


354
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,333 line:-1
the system backgrounds
all other apps,


355
00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:01.934 line:-1 position:50%
and people can be fully focused


356
00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.670 line:-1 position:50%
in the unbounded world
of this app.


357
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,506 line:0
You can check out this session
to learn more


358
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:10,543 position:50%
about Immersive Space
and Immersion Styles.


359
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:14,680 line:-1
During FaceTime, you can launch
an Immersive Space at any time.


360
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.350 line:-1 position:50%
When you are in
a private immersive space,


361
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,252 line:-1
you are in your own
private world,


362
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,688 line:-1
and you break shared context
with everyone else.


363
00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:26.692 line:-1 position:50%
Because of this, the system
will hide other people for you.


364
00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:29.295 line:-1 position:50%
And they will see you
as your contact photo,


365
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,231 line:-1
which indicates you are not
with them right now.


366
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,468 line:-1
Everyone can still
communicate by audio.


367
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:38,471 line:-1
But come on, we don't want
to be alone in FaceTime.


368
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,741 line:-1
Let's share the magical moments
in the immersive world.


369
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,610 line:-1
I have got many great ideas
of immersive experiences


370
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,780 line:-1
which I would love to share
with my friend.


371
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,184 line:-1
For example, it could be
a group activity like this,


372
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,985 line:-1
hanging out in outer space


373
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,955 line:-1
and exploring our beautiful
planet together.


374
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,224 line:-1
To accomplish this,
our shared app


375
00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:00.593 line:-1 position:50%
needs to configure
a group immersive space


376
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,629 line:-1
that can be shared
with everyone.


377
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,866 line:-1
In the configuration of the
system coordinator, you can find


378
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,602 line:-1
the supportsGroupImmersiveSpace
flag.


379
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,438 line:-1
By enabling it,
the app tells the system


380
00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:15.842 line:-1 position:50%
that Immersive Space in this app
is meant to be shared


381
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:19,545 line:-1
and wants to support
immersive group activities.


382
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:23,316 line:-1
When people join a group session
that has this flag enabled,


383
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,186 line:-1
their immersive space will
become a group immersive space.


384
00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:29.288 line:-1 position:50%
The system will move
the space origin


385
00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:32.291 line:-1 position:50%
to a shared location
defined by the template


386
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:37,096 line:-1
to establish a shared coordinate
system for spatial consistency.


387
00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:39.098 line:-1 position:50%
People in the group
immersive space


388
00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:42.268 line:-1 position:50%
will see each other as Personas.


389
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,437 line:-1
Now we have got
a group immersive space


390
00:16:44.437 --> 00:16:47.406 line:-1 position:50%
with a shared coordinate system
and people in there,


391
00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:50.610 line:-1 position:50%
we can place objects
at the same location in it


392
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,246 line:-1
to get spatial consistency.


393
00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:55.548 line:-1 position:50%
In the globe
explore activity example,


394
00:16:55.548 --> 00:16:58.317 line:-1 position:50%
we can place a globe
in the center above the origin


395
00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:00.686 line:-1 position:50%
and make sure
we apply the same offset


396
00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:03.222 line:-1 position:50%
relative to the origin
for everyone.


397
00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:07.126 line:-1 position:50%
Everyone will then see the globe
at the same spot.


398
00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:10.796 line:-1 position:50%
Next, we will figure out how
to maintain visual consistency.


399
00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:13.799 line:-1 position:50%
For instance, if we want
to rotate the globe,


400
00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:17.270 line:-1 position:50%
we will need to make sure
that its orientation is synced


401
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.372 line:-1 position:50%
between everyone.


402
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,674 line:0
To learn more about
how to use group session


403
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,577 line:0
and group session messenger
to synchronize state,


404
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,313 position:50%
check out this
SharePlay session.


405
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,582 line:-1
We could also add
some UI elements


406
00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:33.419 line:-1 position:50%
relative to each person
in a group immersive space.


407
00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:36.188 line:-1 position:50%
For example,
we can give every participant


408
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,658 line:-1
a private control menu
like this.


409
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,159 line:-1
It's right in front of them.


410
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,896 line:-1
They can use it to manipulate
the shared globe easily.


411
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,599 line:-1
To place this control properly,
we have to know


412
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,569 line:-1
where the local user is
in the group immersive space.


413
00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:52.805 line:-1 position:50%
We can utilize the
systemExperienceDisplacement


414
00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:56.676 line:-1 position:50%
method
in GeometryReader3D.


415
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,346 line:-1
This method tells you how the
system has placed space origin


416
00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:02.381 line:-1 position:50%
away from the local user.


417
00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:04.583 line:-1 position:50%
it returns a Pose3D struct,


418
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,421 line:-1
which has both translation
and rotation.


419
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,623 line:-1
In order to get
where the local user is


420
00:18:10.623 --> 00:18:14.727 line:-1 position:50%
relative to the space origin,
we can invert this pose.


421
00:18:14.727 --> 00:18:17.997 line:-1 position:50%
Then we can use it to offset
and rotate the control,


422
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:21,400 line:-1
so it will appear
relative to the local user.


423
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.502 line:-1 position:50%
One thing to note
is that the displacement


424
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:27,039 line:-1
does not update
if the user moves.


425
00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:30.309 line:-1 position:50%
It only provides
a displacement of the space


426
00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:32.478 line:-1 position:50%
when it was initially placed.


427
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,482 line:-1
This offers an easy way to place
content relative to the person


428
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,885 line:-1
without needing to fully track
where they are.


429
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,689 line:-1
The surround template is great
for the globe explore activity,


430
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,891 line:-1
where the app only has
a group immersive space


431
00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:48.227 line:-1 position:50%
with a shared content
in the center.


432
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,664 line:-1
But what if your group activity
has both a shared window


433
00:18:51.664 --> 00:18:54.367 line:-1 position:50%
and a group immersive space?


434
00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:57.036 line:-1 position:50%
For example,
I want to build a group activity


435
00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:59.238 line:-1 position:50%
for studying the solar system
like this,


436
00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:01.440 line:-1 position:50%
where people can start
by reading about a planet


437
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.609 line:-1 position:50%
on a shared window.


438
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,445 line:-1
And they can press a button
to take a closer look


439
00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:09.548 line:-1 position:50%
at the planet model
in a group immersive space.


440
00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:13.552 line:-1 position:50%
I would love people to always
stay side by side in both cases.


441
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,355 line:-1
Let's check out
what we can do with template.


442
00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:19.925 line:-1 position:50%
By default, when your app only
has a group immersive space,


443
00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:22.361 line:-1 position:50%
the Surround template
will be applied,


444
00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:25.865 line:-1 position:50%
and the space origin
will be placed in the center.


445
00:19:25.865 --> 00:19:28.300 line:-1 position:50%
The same layout is applied
when your app


446
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.203 line:-1 position:50%
also has a shared
volumetric scene.


447
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,739 line:-1
But if your app has
a shared vertical window,


448
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,876 line:-1
the Side-by-Side template
will be chosen by default,


449
00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:40.613 line:-1 position:50%
and the space origin is
right below the shared window.


450
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,449 line:-1
But keep in mind, you can always
change the template preference


451
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,585 line:-1
to the one that fits
your group activity best.


452
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,988 line:-1
You can choose
the .conversational template


453
00:19:48.988 --> 00:19:51.023 line:-1 position:50%
or the .sideBySide template,


454
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,358 line:-1
which I think will be
a great one


455
00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:55.494 line:-1 position:50%
for our solar exploration
activity.


456
00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:56.796 line:-1 position:50%
As we learned before,


457
00:19:56.796 --> 00:20:00.266 line:-1 position:50%
the distances in the template
are dynamically adjusted


458
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,401 line:-1
based on the size
of the shared window.


459
00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:05.771 line:-1 position:50%
You may wonder how we can ensure
that the distance is good


460
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,374 line:-1
when there's only
a group immersive space.


461
00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:11.744 line:-1 position:50%
To solve this, we have
a useful knob to tweak templates


462
00:20:11.744 --> 00:20:14.013 line:-1 position:50%
called content extent.


463
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,449 line:-1
It's a modifier
on the template preference,


464
00:20:16.449 --> 00:20:18.117 line:-1 position:50%
which works for both immersive


465
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,520 line:-1
and window-based
group activities.


466
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,056 line:-1
Apps can set this value
as the distance


467
00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:28.727 line:-1 position:50%
from the center of the content
to its farthest edge in points.


468
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,629 line:-1
When content extent is set,


469
00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:33.365 line:-1 position:50%
the active template
will factor in this value


470
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:37,603 line:-1
for placing the people
relative to the app.


471
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,606 line:-1
All right, let's apply what
we learned about template


472
00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:43.476 line:-1 position:50%
and configure the group session
for the solar explore activity


473
00:20:43.476 --> 00:20:45.611 line:-1 position:50%
we showed before.


474
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,348 line:-1
First, we should enable
supportsGroupImmersiveSpace


475
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:53,185 line:-1
so people can view the object
together while immersive.


476
00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:56.889 line:-1 position:50%
Next, let's set the template
preference to .sideBySide


477
00:20:56.889 --> 00:21:00.092 line:-1 position:50%
and also add a modifier
for the contentExtent


478
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,161 line:-1
so people can always
stay side by side


479
00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:06.232 line:-1 position:50%
and have a great distance
with the shared content.


480
00:21:06.232 --> 00:21:07.433 line:-1 position:50%
Cool.
Let's check out


481
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,503 line:-1
what this group activity
would look like with people.


482
00:21:10.503 --> 00:21:12.605 line:-1 position:50%
Here, I'm with my friend Connor,


483
00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:17.343 line:-1 position:50%
and we're browsing planets
on a shared window side by side.


484
00:21:17.343 --> 00:21:19.879 line:-1 position:50%
Later, I press a button,
which lets me go into


485
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:23,282 line:-1
a group immersive space
to explore Saturn.


486
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:26.218 line:-1 position:50%
While I am amazed by
how beautiful this model is,


487
00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:28.988 line:-1 position:50%
I also find Connor
is not with me anymore,


488
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:32,091 line:-1
and all I see
is his contact photo.


489
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,560 line:-1
But actually,
Connor is left behind,


490
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.995 line:-1 position:50%
still watching the window.


491
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,663 line:-1
He needs to press
the button himself


492
00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:40.232 line:-1 position:50%
to enter the group
immersive space.


493
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,634 line:-1
As we learned before,


494
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,303 line:-1
when people are not in the group
immersive space together,


495
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,372 line:-1
they would have
no shared context.


496
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,874 line:-1
So the system
will hide Spatial Personas


497
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,210 line:-1
and show contact photos.


498
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,445 line:-1
If we can still see
each other's Persona,


499
00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:55.014 line:-1 position:50%
Connor may feel really confused


500
00:21:55.014 --> 00:21:58.350 line:-1 position:50%
when I look surprised
at something he doesn't see.


501
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,787 line:0
Same situation could happen
if our group immersive spaces


502
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,924 line:0
are presenting in different
immersion styles.


503
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,725 line:0
For example,
I'm looking around


504
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,561 position:50%
in a fully immersive
environment,


505
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,030 position:50%
but Connor remains
in passthrough.


506
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,233 position:50%
But it would be so nice
if Connor can just follow me


507
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:17,269 line:0
into the same group
immersive space automatically.


508
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,971 line:0
And when he's not
with me there,


509
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:22,441 position:50%
he could know where I am
and join me easily.


510
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,778 line:0
To minimize split contacts in
your immersive group activity,


511
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,713 position:50%
we have a great tool
you can utilize


512
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:32,117 position:50%
in the system coordinator
called Group Immersion Style.


513
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:35,788 position:50%
It provides an async sequence
of optional immersion style,


514
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,624 position:50%
which tells your app
a specific immersion style


515
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:41,594 line:0
of the group immersive space
that other people join,


516
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:45,064 line:0
or nil when they leave
a group immersive space.


517
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:48,667 position:50%
For example, when I open
a group immersive space,


518
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,270 line:0
Connor's app will receive
the immersion style of it,


519
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,472 position:50%
and his app can open
a group immersive space


520
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,341 position:50%
with a matching style.


521
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,876 line:0
Then we will be together
in the group immersive space


522
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,079 position:50%
and have shared context again.


523
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,448 position:50%
Likewise, when Connor
presses the button


524
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,416 line:0
and leaves the group
immersive space,


525
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,954 position:50%
my app will receive nil
and can dismiss immersive space.


526
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,657 position:50%
Now with the help
of group immersion style,


527
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,860 line:0
everyone can always be together.


528
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.929 line:-1 position:50%
Sometimes you
may want to step out


529
00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:19.198 line:-1 position:50%
of the immersive experience
temporarily


530
00:23:19.198 --> 00:23:21.033 line:-1 position:50%
for something urgent.


531
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,136 line:-1
You can do it with a single
press on the Digital Crown.


532
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,039 line:-1
In this case, the system
will not disturb other people


533
00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:30.009 line:-1 position:50%
and change their
group immersion style.


534
00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:33.145 line:-1 position:50%
When you step out, you will see
a SharePlay banner notice,


535
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,581 line:-1
which tells you where
the rest of the group is


536
00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:37.883 line:-1 position:50%
and also provides you
a button to join back


537
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,052 line:-1
to the group
immersive space easily.


538
00:23:40.052 --> 00:23:42.021 line:-1 position:50%
When you tap on the Join button,


539
00:23:42.021 --> 00:23:44.490 line:-1 position:50%
a group immersion style
will be sent to your app


540
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,360 line:-1
for setting up
the group immersive space.


541
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.529 line:-1 position:50%
All right, we have seen
a lot in this session.


542
00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:52.131 line:-1 position:50%
Let's recap!


543
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,434 line:-1
We learned about shared context
and how to use


544
00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:58.871 line:-1 position:50%
system coordinator
and scene association


545
00:23:58.871 --> 00:24:01.607 line:-1 position:50%
to manage spatial
and visual consistency


546
00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:05.444 line:-1 position:50%
in both windowed
and immersive shared apps.


547
00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:08.147 line:-1 position:50%
We introduced template
preferences for your app


548
00:24:08.147 --> 00:24:10.582 line:-1 position:50%
to place people properly.


549
00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:13.252 line:-1 position:50%
And finally, we also showed you
a new way


550
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,989 line:-1
to start SharePlay
using the Share menu.


551
00:24:16.989 --> 00:24:18.290 line:-1 position:50%
Thanks for tuning in.


552
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.526 line:-1 position:50%
We can't wait to see
what incredible experiences


553
00:24:20.526 --> 00:24:22.861 line:-1 position:50%
you’re going to build
with SharePlay.
