3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,380 line:-2
Hi, I'm Kartik,
from Car Experience Engineering,


4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:16,950 line:-2
and welcome to "Optimize CarPlay
for vehicle systems."


5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,487 line:-2
Today, we're thrilled to share
how your vehicle can deliver


6
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,556 line:-1
the best CarPlay experience to drivers.


7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,293 line:-2
If you're an automaker or developer
of vehicle systems,


8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,561 line:-1
this is the session for you.


9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:32,666 line:-2
CarPlay is the smarter, safer way
to use your iPhone in the car.


10
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,669 line:-2
A large part of what makes
a great CarPlay experience


11
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:39,473 line:-2
is how effectively you integrate CarPlay
in your vehicle.


12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,676 line:-2
Today's session consists
of 5 topics to help you achieve this.


13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,381 line:-2
Visual integration is all about making
CarPlay look and feel natural


14
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,016 line:-1
in your system.


15
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,985 line:-2
Then we'll cover
CarPlay infrastructure advancements


16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,655 line:-1
in connectivity, audio,


17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,256 line:-1
and video encoding,


18
00:00:56,323 --> 00:01:00,093 line:-2
which all serve as the backbone
of a great CarPlay experience.


19
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,831 line:-2
And in our final topic,
we'll go over EV routing in CarPlay.


20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,904 line:-2
Last year, we gave a sneak peek
of the next generation of CarPlay.


21
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:14,007 line:-2
The infrastructure advancements
we're introducing today


22
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,244 line:-2
will help prepare your system
for the next generation of CarPlay.


23
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,448 line:-2
Let's get started
with visual integration features.


24
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,319 line:-2
Modern vehicles feature
large main displays


25
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,622 line:-2
with an increasing variety of shapes
and layouts.


26
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,090 line:-1
Some displays are wide,


27
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,192 line:-1
while others are tall.


28
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,628 line:-1
Some displays are non-rectangular,


29
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,296 line:-1
and some show it all,


30
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:40,367 line:-2
by featuring a mix of CarPlay UI
and built-in vehicle UI.


31
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,503 line:-1
CarPlay is designed to integrate well


32
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,405 line:-2
into all these variations
of main displays.


33
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,209 line:-2
Let's see how you can tailor CarPlay
to make it feel at home in your vehicle.


34
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,648 line:-2
In a previous WWDC video, we introduced
the CarPlay view area.


35
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,784 line:-1
Today, we're building upon this concept.


36
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,888 line:-2
The view area defines the boundaries
where CarPlay draws its UI.


37
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,057 line:-1
CarPlay looks great in full screen.


38
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,194 line:-2
However, your built-in vehicle UI
may have additional layouts


39
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:10,264 line:-2
where CarPlay appears alongside widgets
or other elements.


40
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,901 line:-2
In this case, support
dynamic screen resizing


41
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,336 line:-2
so people can seamlessly switch
between layouts.


42
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,107 line:-2
If your system displays
a widget next to CarPlay,


43
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,309 line:-1
CarPlay automatically insets itself


44
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:25,612 line:-2
to create more visual spacing
with your built-in UI.


45
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,282 line:-1
You don't need to inset the view area;


46
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,651 line:-1
simply give it as much space as possible,


47
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,253 line:-2
and CarPlay will create
the right amount of padding.


48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,622 line:-1
What if your display is non-rectangular?


49
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,491 line:-1
In this case, define the view area


50
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:40,761 line:-2
as the smallest rectangle enclosing
your display.


51
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,596 position:49% line:-1
Also, define a safe area


52
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,965 line:-2
as the largest rectangle
within your display.


53
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,236 line:-2
CarPlay draws interactive content
inside the safe area


54
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:52,105 line:-1
to ensure all important UI is visible.


55
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,942 line:-2
Outside the safe area,
the pixels are black.


56
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,212 line:-1
Now you have the option to enable CarPlay


57
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,948 line:-1
to draw UI outside the safe area.


58
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,051 line:-2
CarPlay will draw its background
to the edge of your display,


59
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:08,322 line:-2
giving the driver a visually appealing
and immersive experience.


60
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:12,426 line:-2
Keep in mind that this safe area flag is
only available for the main display.


61
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,431 line:-2
Let's turn our attention
to the CarPlay status bar.


62
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,335 line:-2
The CarPlay status bar is permanently
displayed in CarPlay's UI,


63
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,605 line:-2
providing the driver with convenience
at all times.


64
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,140 line:-1
The status bar is intelligently positioned


65
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,011 line:-2
based on your display's resolution
and aspect ratio.


66
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:34,047 line:-2
It can appear vertically,
on the driver side,


67
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:37,317 line:-2
or horizontally,
along the bottom edge of CarPlay's UI.


68
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,556 line:-2
In some cases, it may make sense
to override the status bar's position


69
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,125 line:-2
for a better fit with your system's
built-in UI.


70
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,629 line:-2
This can be done
with the view area flag.


71
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,331 line:-2
For example, you may want to align
the status bar


72
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,468 line:-2
with other permanent controls
in your system's UI.


73
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:58,839 line:-2
The status bar also features
some slick rounded corners.


74
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,576 line:-2
We love how rounded corners look
on CarPlay,


75
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,145 line:-2
and corner clipping masks help
with their visual appeal.


76
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,482 line:-1
Let's start with some context.


77
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,051 line:-2
By default, the background
of CarPlay's rounded corners


78
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,553 line:-1
appear in black.


79
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,888 line:-2
This looks great
when CarPlay is full screen.


80
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,626 line:-2
Here's a system where CarPlay is drawn in
a window.


81
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,129 line:-2
If you look at the corners
of CarPlay's UI,


82
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:25,832 line:-2
you can see the black background
showing behind CarPlay's rounded corners.


83
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,869 line:-1
These small black triangles now appear


84
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,906 line:-2
which may not blend well
with your system's wallpaper.


85
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,609 line:-1
By supporting corner clipping masks,


86
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,846 line:-2
your system can magically make
these black triangles disappear.


87
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,782 line:-2
The way this works is,
iPhone provides


88
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,052 line:-2
a corner blending mask
containing transparency information.


89
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:50,591 line:-2
Your vehicle system applies this mask
to each corner of CarPlay's UI


90
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,726 line:-1
to remove the black triangles.


91
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,962 line:-1
Then you can draw your background


92
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,065 line:-2
all the way up
to CarPlay's rounded corners.


93
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,401 line:-2
This makes CarPlay truly blend
into the built-in system


94
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,470 line:-1
and create great visual appeal.


95
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:07,140 line:-2
Take note that corner clipping masks
cannot be used


96
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,610 line:-1
when CarPlay draws outside the safe area.


97
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:14,081 line:-2
It's time to shift our focus
onto the next feature, UI focus transfer.


98
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,352 line:-2
Some systems support a rotary knob
or touchpad as an input device.


99
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:22,789 line:-2
As the driver interacts with CarPlay
using this input device,


100
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:26,059 line:-2
CarPlay UI shows a focus highlight
on the selected element.


101
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,897 line:-2
Your system may show
its own focus highlight


102
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,432 line:-2
as the driver scrolls
through the built-in UI.


103
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,303 line:-1
CarPlay supports focus transfer,


104
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,406 line:-2
allowing the driver to seamlessly move
between UI elements


105
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,441 line:-1
in CarPlay and your system.


106
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:45,312 line:-2
The driver can simply nudge the knob
to transfer focus.


107
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,614 line:-1
Our APIs ensure


108
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,450 line:-2
that only one focus highlight
is shown at a time


109
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,854 line:-2
by arbitrating focus
between CarPlay and your system.


110
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,958 line:-2
Support focus transfer if your system
presents CarPlay


111
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,760 line:-1
in a windowed configuration


112
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,562 line:-1
and supports a knob or touchpad.


113
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,366 line:-2
Let's walk through how focus is
coordinated using the CarPlay protocol.


114
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,070 line:-2
When CarPlay starts,
the built-in system determines


115
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,805 line:-1
if focus should be given to CarPlay.


116
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,075 line:-2
Here, you can see focus belongs
to the system.


117
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,912 line:-2
When the driver directs
focus towards CarPlay,


118
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,581 line:-1
the system dismisses focus


119
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,283 line:-2
and provides heading
and position information to CarPlay.


120
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:28,021 line:-2
CarPlay uses this information
to present its focus highlight


121
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,157 line:-1
on the most intuitive UI element.


122
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,395 line:-2
When the driver directs focus
back to the built-in UI,


123
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,098 line:-1
CarPlay offers focus to the system.


124
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,033 line:-1
If the system acquires focus,


125
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,702 line:-1
CarPlay dismisses its focus


126
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,071 line:-2
and the system presents
its own focus highlight.


127
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,975 line:-2
Adopt UI focus transfer
to create continuity


128
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,310 line:-1
between CarPlay and your built-in UI.


129
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,780 line:-2
Let's talk
about CarPlay appearance mode.


130
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:58,519 line:-4
CarPlay UI can appear in either light
or dark themes.


131
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,288 line:-4
This brings the familiar
light and dark UI experience


132
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,190 line:-3
which people love on iPhone.


133
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:07,828 line:-2
Synchronize CarPlay's appearance
with your built-in UI appearance.


134
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:11,231 line:-2
People will appreciate seeing CarPlay
and your system in harmony.


135
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,236 line:-2
CarPlay's appearance can change based
on vehicle state, user settings,


136
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,071 line:-1
and time of day.


137
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,708 line:-2
For example, if your system
shifts to a dark theme at night,


138
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,712 line:-2
your system simply informs CarPlay
to change appearance based on time of day.


139
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,682 line:-1
And if your system activates night mode,


140
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,718 line:-2
CarPlay will automatically shift
into a dark appearance.


141
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,256 line:1
There is also a separate appearance mode
control for Map UI.


142
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,393 line:1
Let's walk through a few examples
to illustrate how all this works.


143
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:45,566 line:1
In this example, the built-in UI is using
a dark theme on the main display.


144
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,536 line:1
The system informs CarPlay to use
a dark appearance mode


145
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,071 line:1
to create a consistent look.


146
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:56,677 line:1
If your system shows CarPlay navigation UI
on the instrument cluster,


147
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,779 line:1
specify the appearance for each display.


148
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,883 line:1
In this case, both the main display
and instrument cluster


149
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,451 line:1
are in a dark UI theme.


150
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,423 line:1
If your system shows
different appearance modes per display,


151
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,092 line:1
inform CarPlay to match.


152
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,930 line:1
And lastly, CarPlay's map UI has
a separate appearance setting.


153
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,734 line:1
Keep your eyes on the instrument cluster
as we shift into a light map appearance.


154
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,872 line:1
Be sure to synchronize
CarPlay's map UI appearance


155
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,107 line:1
with your built-in system's
map appearance.


156
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,678 line:-2
Now that we've covered synchronizing
UI appearance with your system,


157
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,014 line:-2
let's look into what kinds of content
iPhone can power


158
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,749 line:-1
across your system's displays.


159
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,188 line:-2
We'll be covering three common kinds
of displays in modern vehicle systems:


160
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,723 line:-1
the main display,


161
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,858 line:-1
the instrument cluster display,


162
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,693 line:-1
and a head up display.


163
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,331 line:-2
Let's review the iPhone content available
today for each of these displays.


164
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,903 line:-2
On the main display,
show the CarPlay video stream.


165
00:08:55,969 --> 00:09:01,008 line:-2
In addition, your system’s built-in UI
can be powered with iAP2 metadata


166
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:05,512 line:-2
like route guidance, phone call,
and now-playing information.


167
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,048 line:-1
If your system presents a map widget,


168
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,351 line:-2
populate the widget
with a CarPlay navigation UI stream


169
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,187 line:-1
while CarPlay navigation is active.


170
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,558 line:-2
This UI stream can be configured
to present ETA information,


171
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,860 line:-1
speed limit signs, and a compass.


172
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,898 line:-2
On the instrument cluster, you can show
CarPlay navigation UI streams.


173
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,535 line:-2
If your system has controls to change
the map zoom level


174
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,304 line:-1
on the instrument cluster,


175
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,306 line:-1
add CarPlay map zoom support.


176
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:35,776 line:-2
And implement your built-in UI
with iAP2 metadata


177
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,477 line:-1
as you would on the main display.


178
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,715 line:-1
On the head up display, use iAP2 metadata


179
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,918 line:-2
so people can view information
like turn-by-turn directions


180
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,254 line:-1
in their line of sight as they're driving.


181
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,791 line:-2
Let's look under the hood
at infrastructure features


182
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:53,894 line:-2
to create a reliable and performant
CarPlay system.


183
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,898 line:-2
Ultimately, these changes will also set
your system up


184
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,833 line:-1
for the next generation of CarPlay.


185
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:06,206 line:-2
Our first topic is all about connectivity
between iPhone and your vehicle system.


186
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,642 line:-1
The wireless connection experience begins


187
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,677 line:-1
when a driver pairs for the first time.


188
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:14,114 line:-2
Make the first-time-pairing experience
easy for drivers


189
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,949 line:-1
by supporting out-of-band pairing.


190
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:20,854 line:-2
Out-of-band pairing allows people
to pair their device for wireless CarPlay


191
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,824 line:-2
by simply plugging their iPhone
into the car.


192
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:27,427 line:-2
It's convenient and requires
less interaction.


193
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:32,032 line:-2
People expect all wireless CarPlay systems
to support out-of-band pairing over USB.


194
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,638 line:-2
If your system supports digital car keys,
we've got something new for you.


195
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:42,442 line:-4
Starting with iOS 17,
iPhone supports pairing for CarPlay


196
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,044 line:-3
over a car key connection.


197
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,481 line:-1
This makes pairing even easier for people,


198
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:52,653 line:-2
as car key and CarPlay pairing experiences
combine into a unified flow.


199
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,256 line:-2
After adding a car key on iPhone,


200
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,426 line:-3
people are prompted to pair
for wireless CarPlay.


201
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,463 line:-3
If accepted, pairing occurs
over the car key connection,


202
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,399 line:-2
and CarPlay connects wirelessly.


203
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,435 line:-1
After performing a one-time pairing,


204
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,004 line:-2
your vehicle automatically connects
with iPhone


205
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,440 line:-1
every time the driver enters the car.


206
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,709 line:-2
Bonjour is used for your vehicle
and iPhone


207
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:19,179 line:-2
to establish an IP connection
and start the CarPlay session.


208
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,616 line:-2
We've introduced
a simplified connection flow


209
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,018 line:-2
which is the preferred way
to connect CarPlay.


210
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:28,222 line:-1
By using the existing iAP2 connection


211
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,558 line:-2
to perform IP address
and port information exchange,


212
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,560 line:-1
Bonjour is no longer needed,


213
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,330 line:-2
and the implementation is simpler
and faster.


214
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:41,835 line:-2
This also adds support
for WPA3-only networks.


215
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:47,875 line:-2
The simplified connection flow can connect
with devices running iOS 14 or newer.


216
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,845 line:-2
If your system is designed to connect
with earlier iOS versions,


217
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:55,415 line:-2
continue to support
the Bonjour connection flow.


218
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:59,353 line:-2
For those of you who support car keys,
we're back with another feature.


219
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:03,891 line:-2
Your system can instantly connect
to wireless CarPlay


220
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,294 line:-2
as soon as the driver enters the vehicle
with a digital car key.


221
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:13,000 line:-2
Using iAP2 messages, your system can map
a digital car key pairing


222
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,635 line:-1
to a CarPlay device.


223
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,770 line:-2
The next time a driver approaches
the vehicle


224
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,872 line:-1
and a car key connection is created,


225
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,074 line:-1
your system prepares its CarPlay stack.


226
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:26,280 line:-2
By checking for a corresponding
CarPlay pairing with that car key,


227
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,415 line:-1
you can start CarPlay even earlier.


228
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:32,886 line:-1
To the driver, CarPlay appears instantly.


229
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:36,290 line:-2
We are so stoked for you to make use
of this in your next system.


230
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:41,862 line:-2
And let's not forget, we all agree
on how important a robust connection is


231
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,765 line:-1
to create a reliable CarPlay experience.


232
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,734 line:-2
To maintain a robust CarPlay connection
in your system,


233
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,003 line:-1
design for handling wireless interference,


234
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,240 line:-2
as interference may impact
Wi-Fi performance.


235
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:58,145 line:-2
The first step is to detect interferers
on the wireless channel.


236
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,013 line:-1
Once interferers have been detected,


237
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,817 line:-2
steer clear of the interference
by using channel switch announcements.


238
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,621 line:-2
If your system supports
multiple wireless radios,


239
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,957 line:-1
you can use BSS transition management


240
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,060 line:-2
to direct iPhone
onto another access point.


241
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,330 line:-2
Keep in mind that people
best experience wireless CarPlay


242
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,732 line:-1
when operating on the 5 GHz band.


243
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,202 line:-2
And finally, to create
a smoother experience


244
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,304 line:-1
during intermittent disconnects,


245
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,673 line:-2
your system should suppress
short link disconnects


246
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,142 line:-1
on CarPlay TCP sockets.


247
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,444 line:-1
Do not close these sockets


248
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:33,180 line:-2
due solely to a data link layer
disconnection.


249
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,682 line:-1
After connecting to your system,


250
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:39,019 line:-2
CarPlay can start playing audio
through the vehicle's speakers.


251
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:42,756 line:-2
Let's go over some audio features
that are available to your system.


252
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:46,894 line:-2
Audio apps are now adopting
AirPlay enhanced audio buffering


253
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,397 line:-2
to provide a greater playback experience
on iPhone.


254
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:53,300 line:-2
People would love to experience
the same audio improvements


255
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:54,668 line:-1
in your vehicle as well.


256
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,538 line:-1
Now, you can add support


257
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:59,873 line:-1
for enhanced buffering to your system,


258
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,177 line:-2
and your vehicles will automatically take
advantage of these benefits.


259
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,080 line:-2
Enhanced buffering
is the preferred platform


260
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,350 line:-2
for streaming audio like music
to your car's speakers.


261
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,619 line:-2
The audio is provided
as an additional stream


262
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,021 line:-1
to the vehicle system,


263
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,422 line:-1
called main buffered audio.


264
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:20,794 line:-2
The CarPlay communication plugin contains
an up to 2 minute audio buffer,


265
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,464 line:-2
where audio from iPhone is streamed
in faster than real-time speeds.


266
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,801 line:-1
This makes for improved responsiveness,


267
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:31,905 line:-2
and audio content can continue playback
through an intermittent disconnection.


268
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:36,476 line:-4
You may want check out
"Tune Up Your AirPlay Audio Experience"


269
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,080 line:-4
for more details on what's available
to audio app developers.


270
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:44,351 line:-2
People expect audio mixing in CarPlay
to work as it does on iPhone.


271
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:48,355 line:-2
Ensure your system can mix
various audio output streams


272
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,424 line:-1
to create a consistent audio experience.


273
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:56,396 line:-2
Main audio, main buffered audio,
alternate audio, and auxiliary audio


274
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,399 line:-1
can be active and mixed simultaneously.


275
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:03,470 line:-2
Enhanced Siri brings
the familiar Siri experience on iPhone


276
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,305 line:-1
to CarPlay.


277
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:09,343 line:-2
People are accustomed to saying "Siri"
in order to activate Siri,


278
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,411 line:-2
and they expect it to work in CarPlay
as well.


279
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,915 line:-1
Ensure your system supports Enhanced Siri.


280
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,719 line:-2
Enhanced Siri leverages
the vehicle's microphone


281
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:22,256 line:-2
to reliably detect when the driver
is activating Siri by voice.


282
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,862 line:-2
Also, audio apps and radio are mixed
into the background of Siri audio.


283
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,032 line:-2
People love the resulting
uninterrupted audio experience.


284
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,204 line:-2
And lastly, it enables the driver
to instantly activate Siri


285
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,039 line:-1
upon pressing the push to talk button.


286
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,109 line:-3
See "Advances in CarPlay Systems"


287
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:45,979 line:-4
for a detailed look at how Enhanced Siri
can work in your system.


288
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,715 line:-1
Let's move on to video encoding.


289
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:53,387 line:-2
Historically, CarPlay UI streams
have used H.264 encoding.


290
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:58,225 line:-2
CarPlay now supports HEVC encoding
for all UI streams.


291
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:02,729 line:-2
HEVC is more efficient and enables CarPlay
to support higher-resolution displays.


292
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:08,368 line:-2
Your system should continue to support
H.264 for backwards compatibility.


293
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:12,172 line:-2
All of these connectivity, audio,
and video encoding features


294
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,708 line:-2
will make the experience so much better
for drivers.


295
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:18,312 line:-2
For that reason, they are required
for systems supporting


296
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,147 line:-1
the next generation of CarPlay.


297
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:24,151 line:-2
We have just enough range
to cover our final topic: EV routing.


298
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,854 line:-1
Apple Maps can help you plan trips


299
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,122 line:-2
that include stops for charging
your electric vehicle.


300
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:34,127 line:-2
When you get driving directions, Maps
analyzes the route and other factors,


301
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:37,331 line:-2
and identifies charging stations
along the way.


302
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,434 line:-2
This year, in addition to support
for offline maps,


303
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,603 line:-1
EV routing has some great updates.


304
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:47,341 line:-2
Users can now tell Maps
which charging network they prefer


305
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:50,911 line:-2
and see real-time charging station
availability on the map.


306
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:54,047 line:-2
To support EV routing,
Apple Maps needs to know


307
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,050 line:-2
about some characteristics
of your electric vehicle


308
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,219 line:-1
to tailor the EV routing experience.


309
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,057 line:-2
In addition, you will need to support
interfaces to communicate


310
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,493 line:-1
your vehicle's state of charge.


311
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,595 line:-1
If you have an automaker app,


312
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:11,732 line:-2
support SiriKit intents so people can use
EV routing


313
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,035 line:-1
when inside or outside the vehicle.


314
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:17,804 line:-2
In addition, you should support
iAP2 messages


315
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,440 line:-2
for real-time state of charge
when driving.


316
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,977 line:-2
We've made it through all the ways
you can enrich the CarPlay experience


317
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,212 line:-1
in your vehicle system.


318
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,881 line:-1
Soon, you may want your next vehicle


319
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,484 line:-1
to support the next generation of CarPlay:


320
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,920 line:-2
the ultimate iPhone experience
for the car.


321
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:37,925 line:-2
It brings a fully integrated, immersive
iPhone experience to your vehicle.


322
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,995 line:-2
The next generation of CarPlay
builds on CarPlay


323
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,631 line:-2
and fully utilizes
