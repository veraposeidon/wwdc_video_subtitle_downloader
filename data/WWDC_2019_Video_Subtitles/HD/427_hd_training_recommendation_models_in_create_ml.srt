00:00:13,276 --> 00:00:15,346
>> Hello. I'm Hoyt, from the


4
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:16,816
Turi team at Apple, and I'm here


5
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,376
to tell you about the Create ML


6
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:19,236
Recommender.


7
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:21,486
Create ML Recommenders are a


8
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:23,366
fantastic way to add


9
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,556
personalization and intelligence


10
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:27,416
into the user experience of your


11
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:27,666
app.


12
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,546
Suppose I have a hiking journal


13
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:32,656
where I can log different hikes


14
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:34,506
I've taken and how much I like


15
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:35,886
or dislike each of them.


16
00:00:36,816 --> 00:00:38,656
Wouldn't it be great if this


17
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:41,186
also recommended new trails for


18
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:42,756
me to try based on the


19
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:44,876
preferences I already expressed?


20
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:48,756
Or suppose I have a math quiz


21
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:51,946
app, where the user has to solve


22
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:53,446
a number of math problems in a


23
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:54,366
timed session.


24
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:56,706
It would make sense here to


25
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:58,396
choose the next problem to ask


26
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,256
based on which of the previously


27
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:02,016
problems the user got correct or


28
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:02,426
incorrect.


29
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,495
Or let's take a look at a


30
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,216
shopping list where I can list


31
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:08,316
out the ingredients I need to


32
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:09,656
buy the next time I go to the


33
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:10,386
grocery store.


34
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:13,586
Now, this is really simple here.


35
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:16,546
But if it suggested ingredients


36
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:18,156
that I may have forgotten, it


37
00:01:18,156 --> 00:01:19,906
makes the experience more


38
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:21,296
engaging and interesting.


39
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:25,286
My goal today is to enable you


40
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,916
to create these kind of user


41
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,966
experiences in your app through


42
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:30,536
the Create ML recommender.


43
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,276
Let's dive into how we're going


44
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:35,466
to do this and let's start with


45
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:35,926
the data.


46
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:40,906
Recommenders work by looking for


47
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:43,236
patterns in groups of items.


48
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:45,206
Back to the shopping list.


49
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:46,996
When I'm going to the grocery


50
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:49,556
store, it's likely I have a few


51
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:50,576
recipes in mind.


52
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:52,016
I want to buy the ingredients


53
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:53,006
for them and make something


54
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:53,616
delicious.


55
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,406
And, well what are recipes?


56
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:58,756
They are groups of ingredients.


57
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:00,776
And it turns out this is a


58
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:03,346
perfect example of the kind of


59
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:04,976
data you can use for


60
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:05,646
Recommender.


61
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:08,645
In fact, all you need to do here


62
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:11,036
is to take these recipes and


63
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:13,636
turn them into a table with a


64
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:16,826
group column and an item column.


65
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:19,456
Each row here says that a


66
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:21,006
particular item belongs to a


67
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:21,976
particular group.


68
00:02:23,106 --> 00:02:25,616
Now, here the groups are recipes


69
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:27,146
and the items are ingredients.


70
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:28,566
But this can be much more


71
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:29,006
general.


72
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:31,316
Let's go to the math quiz app.


73
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:33,406
Here, the group can be the


74
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:35,026
particular session that a


75
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:36,736
problem was asked in.


76
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:38,026
The item is the problem.


77
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:40,926
And, well, I need to introduce


78
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:41,966
one more concept here.


79
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:43,896
We need to be able to give the


80
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:44,966
model feedback.


81
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:46,706
We need to tell it which


82
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:48,856
problems the user got correct or


83
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:49,516
incorrect.


84
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,986
And so the Recommender also


85
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:53,646
works with a rating column.


86
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:56,136
A rating is a measure of how


87
00:02:56,136 --> 00:02:57,666
good or how desirable a


88
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,126
particular interaction is.


89
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,976
Here, we could assign a 1 if the


90
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:03,946
user got the problem correct, or


91
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:05,166
a 0 if they got it wrong.


92
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:09,356
Now, with the hiking app, the


93
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:13,396
data there has the user, has the


94
00:03:13,396 --> 00:03:15,826
group being the user, the trail


95
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:17,846
being the item, and a rating


96
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:19,926
being an explicit feedback from


97
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,166
the user about how much they


98
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,976
liked or disliked that


99
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:24,496
particular trail.


100
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,746
Now, in your app, you would


101
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:31,276
query it with the same kind of


102
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:31,706
data.


103
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:33,616
You would locally track these


104
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:35,486
interactions and you would feed


105
00:03:35,486 --> 00:03:38,946
in a set of items or item rating


106
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:40,366
pairs to your model.


107
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,786
Your model would then recommend


108
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,856
new items based on the


109
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:46,696
preferences and patterns


110
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:49,046
expressed in your input data.


111
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,536
Let's see this particular one in


112
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:51,976
action.


113
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:55,156
So, I have here a simple hiking


114
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:55,526
journal.


115
00:03:56,276 --> 00:03:57,886
I don't have any hikes logged


116
00:03:57,886 --> 00:03:59,696
yet and so it's actually


117
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,526
recommending popular items,


118
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:02,996
things that get consistently


119
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:03,646
high ratings.


120
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:05,246
Let's go see if there's any


121
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,266
interesting ones in here.


122
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:09,366
Well, I'm adventurous, let's try


123
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:09,786
this one.


124
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:10,866
Well, okay.


125
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:13,166
Actually too hot, too dry.


126
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,446
Didn't really like it.


127
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:17,055
So, I'm going to say it's not


128
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:17,446
for me.


129
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:21,046
Now, what we see here is that


130
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:23,326
this hiking journal has now


131
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:25,996
updated the hikes based on the


132
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:27,536
preferences I've expressed


133
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:28,666
already.


134
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:31,576
It's recommending different


135
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:32,176
landscapes.


136
00:04:32,176 --> 00:04:33,786
Ah. This one looks really nice.


137
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:35,206
I grew up in Colorado.


138
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:36,816
I love aspens, I love tall


139
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:37,306
mountains.


140
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:37,926
Let's try it.


141
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:39,796
Okay. It was fantastic.


142
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:43,916
Loved it. And here the model is


143
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:44,966
learning more about my


144
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:45,926
preferences now.


145
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:47,466
It knows I like mountains,


146
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,806
rocks, and colorful foliage.


147
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:52,406
So, let's try another one.


148
00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:53,906
All right.


149
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:55,116
There we go.


150
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:59,506
Now I'm exhausted.


151
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:00,886
Three hikes in one day.


152
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:01,856
That's quite a bit [laughter].


153
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:05,446
Let's go back to the slides


154
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:05,676
here.

[ Applause ]


156
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:13,786
Now, I already showed you an


157
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:15,716
example of the type of data used


158
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:17,676
to train this particular model.


159
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:21,216
Now I would like to dive into


160
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:23,536
how the Create ML Recommender


161
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,666
extracts the patterns from this


162
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:28,526
data and builds a model that you


163
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:30,326
can use in your app.


164
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:32,496
The Create ML Recommender works


165
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,086
by learning relationships


166
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:35,926
between the items.


167
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,356
What items tend to go with what


168
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:39,056
other items?


169
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:41,236
Let's suppose we have three


170
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:41,806
hikes here.


171
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:44,186
Two of these are up tall, steep,


172
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:46,066
mountain peaks, possibly the


173
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:46,856
kind I would like.


174
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:49,526
And one of these is a nice


175
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:51,346
stroll by a sandy beach.


176
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,676
Now, that information is not


177
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:56,216
actually present in the model.


178
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:58,786
All we have are hikers, trails,


179
00:05:58,786 --> 00:05:59,666
and ratings.


180
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:02,576
However, if you like climbing


181
00:06:02,576 --> 00:06:04,576
these tall mountain peaks, it's


182
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:05,676
likely you would give both of


183
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:06,926
these similar ratings.


184
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:08,216
And so what we would see in the


185
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:10,106
data is that the same hiker


186
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:11,576
would give each of these hikes


187
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:12,756
similar ratings.


188
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,016
Likewise, because you go out and


189
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:17,376
enjoy a nice stroll by the


190
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,716
beach, it doesn't necessarily


191
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,116
mean you want to climb a tall,


192
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:21,236
cold, windy mountain.


193
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:23,226
And, or vice versa.


194
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:25,746
And so you may give these two


195
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:27,346
trails different ratings.


196
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:30,756
The Create ML Recommender would


197
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:32,476
find these patterns in the data


198
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:34,946
and learn that these first two


199
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:36,406
hikes are similar to each other.


200
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:37,646
They tend to go together.


201
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:39,706
And the third one is different.


202
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,316
Now, when you throw all the


203
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:43,966
items into the mix, the


204
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,766
Recommender builds a graph of


205
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:47,296
which items tend to go with


206
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:48,236
which other items.


207
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,676
How they're all related.


208
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,416
And it's this graph that gets


209
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,026
packaged into your model.


210
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,386
All of the user data and the


211
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:56,536
group data present in your


212
00:06:56,536 --> 00:06:58,916
training data is not explicitly


213
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,296
present in the final model.


214
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:06,786
Now, to do this in your app, the


215
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:08,416
easiest way to build this model


216
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,546
is through the Recommender


217
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:11,596
template in the Create ML app.


218
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:14,436
That, like all of the other


219
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:15,796
templates, guides you through


220
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:18,486
the process of loading your


221
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:20,386
data, building your model,


222
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:22,536
evaluating your model's


223
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:24,436
performance, and exporting your


224
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:27,036
model to Core ML.


225
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:29,486
Now, if you want to do it


226
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:31,546
programmatically, this is also


227
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:33,456
possible through the Create ML


228
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:34,016
framework.


229
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,846
And here the process is the


230
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:36,306
same.


231
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:39,276
First we load our training data


232
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:41,406
from a CSV file or a JSON file.


233
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:45,126
We then specify what the group


234
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:47,216
or user column, what's the item


235
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,196
column, and optionally, which is


236
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:50,126
the rating column.


237
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,476
If we have data that's not


238
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:55,436
present in the training data, we


239
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:57,926
can evaluate how well our model,


240
00:07:57,926 --> 00:07:59,646
how accurately our model can


241
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,886
anticipate those new data by


242
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:03,996
using the model evaluate method.


243
00:08:04,346 --> 00:08:06,016
And finally, we can write this


244
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:07,216
model out to Core ML.


245
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:10,016
Now, in your app, you would


246
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,936
locally track the interactions.


247
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,786
If your model uses ratings, you


248
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,186
would track a dictionary of


249
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:17,376
items to ratings.


250
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:19,936
Otherwise, you would simply use


251
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:20,926
a list of items.


252
00:08:22,116 --> 00:08:23,226
Then, you would construct the


253
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:24,596
input to your model by also


254
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:26,756
specifying how many items you


255
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,766
wanted to recommend.


256
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:30,206
And finally, your model will


257
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:31,966
return a ranked list of


258
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:33,946
suggested items based on the


259
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,606
input preferences it believes


260
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,966
most go with your input set.


261
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:42,635
Let me wrap this up with a few


262
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:44,035
final considerations here.


263
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:49,526
First, these models are very


264
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:50,186
flexible.


265
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:52,126
They can be used in many


266
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:53,746
scenarios that don't fall into


267
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:55,726
the traditional user, item,


268
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:58,366
rating system of recommenders.


269
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:00,496
We, I gave you several examples


270
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:02,576
here but I'm excited to see how


271
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,606
you as creative app developers


272
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:06,026
can incorporate this into the


273
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:07,726
user experiences of your app.


274
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:12,306
Second, these models shift with


275
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:12,766
your app.


276
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,426
That means they're on the device


277
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:15,676
and they work offline and


278
00:09:15,676 --> 00:09:16,416
they're fast.


279
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:18,656
It's perfect for just adding


280
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:20,396
that touch of personalization


281
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:22,356
into your user experience.


282
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:25,736
Finally, because they are with


283
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:27,296
your app and work offline, that


284
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:28,616
means they're also privacy


285
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:29,246
preserving.


286
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:31,586
That way you can guarantee to


287
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:33,626
your users that their data is


288
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:35,916
secure, even though the app


289
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,506
adapts and responds to their


290
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:38,246
preferences.


291
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,186
Finally, to wrap up this entire


292
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:43,266
session, you heard about some


293
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,976
amazing new advances in text


294
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:46,726
classification that allow us to


295
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:48,316
take advantage of the semantic


296
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:50,786
meaning of the text, even with


297
00:09:50,786 --> 00:09:52,076
the limited amount of input


298
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:52,416
data.


299
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:54,996
You also heard about the new


300
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:57,066
activity classification, which


301
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:58,536
allows you to understand and


302
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:00,146
assign meaning to the motion and


303
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:01,336
activities of your user.


304
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:04,116
And finally, I just introduced


305
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:06,256
the recommender which allows you


306
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:08,426
to personalize the user


307
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:09,656
experience of your app into the


308
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,126
many, many different ways.


309
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:14,366

310
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:15,726
these things, please visit the


311

session, or come talk to us in


313
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:20,106

314
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:20,876
Thank you.
