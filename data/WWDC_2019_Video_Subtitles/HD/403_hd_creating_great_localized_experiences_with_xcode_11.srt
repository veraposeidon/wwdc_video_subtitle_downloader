00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:10,916
>> [Applause] All right.


3
00:00:12,706 --> 00:00:13,286
Good morning.


4
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:15,816
Thank you for attending this


5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:16,326
session.


6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,066
My name is Kulpreet.


7
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:19,386
I'm a Software Engineer in


8
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,206
Localization and I'll be joined


9
00:00:21,206 --> 00:00:22,766
by my colleagues Vivian and


10
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:23,226
Arthur.


11
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:26,576
In this session, I'll be going


12
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:28,016
over some exciting new


13
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:29,386
localization features in our


14
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:29,946
platforms.


15
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:32,095
Vivian and Arthur will then


16
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:33,446
touch on some new tooling in


17
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:35,496
Xcode 11, including some great


18
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:36,986
enhancements to localization


19
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:39,606
workflows, localizing images,


20
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:41,756
and how you can use testing to


21
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:43,516
generate screenshots of your app


22
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:45,176
in any language.


23
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:49,676
Today, we estimate over 70% of


24
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:51,476
our users are outside the United


25
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:52,046
States.


26
00:00:53,516 --> 00:00:55,186
Localization is an opportunity


27
00:00:55,186 --> 00:00:57,516
for you to expand your reach and


28
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,026
capture new markets with your


29
00:00:59,026 --> 00:00:59,136
app.


30
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:04,126
At Apple, we care deeply about


31
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:05,946
creating a great experience for


32
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:07,406
all of our users around the


33
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:07,716
world.


34
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:10,856
This year, we have a host of new


35
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:12,746
features and improvements for


36
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:13,896
our Multilingual and


37
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:15,066
International Users.


38
00:01:16,196 --> 00:01:19,486
To name a few, in iOS 13 we have


39
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,166
keyboards for 38 new languages.


40
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,146
I'm sure if your language is up


41
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:25,116
there you're really excited.


42
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:28,096
We also have a new setup flow


43
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:29,766
that guides multilingual users


44
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:31,886
to the right language settings.


45
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:34,766
Now one of these features I'm


46
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,676
particularly excited about, and


47
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:38,486
I want to dive a bit deeper with


48
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:39,216
you.


49
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:42,516
In iOS 13 there's a new setting


50
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:43,786
that appears from Multilingual


51
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:45,786
Users in your app settings page.


52
00:01:46,926 --> 00:01:48,506
I'm happy to say that users can


53
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:49,906
now set the language of your app


54
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:51,876
independent of the system


55
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:52,346
language.


56
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:56,696
[ Applause ]


57
00:01:57,196 --> 00:01:58,546
If a user has a connected watch,


58
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,146
the setting will also sync to


59
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:00,936
the accompanying watch


60
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:01,646
application.


61
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:04,826
And similarly, on macOS, users


62
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:06,176
can set the language of an app


63
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:07,966
via Language and Region


64
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:08,946
preferences.


65
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:12,366
This is important because in


66
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,256
multilingual regions, users may


67
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,346
prefer to use different


68
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:16,696
languages in different context.


69
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:19,046
In a region like Hong Kong,


70
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:21,076
someone might read their news in


71
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:22,166
Chinese even though they do


72
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,496
their banking in English.


73
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:27,136
In India, a student will go to


74
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:29,396
school and learn in English even


75
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:30,466
though they come home and speak


76
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,576
Hindi with their family.


77
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:34,386
Apps are windows into these


78
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:36,476
interactions we have everyday.


79
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:38,296
And this new setting allows


80
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,916
users to choose a language that


81
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,076
reflects their preference for


82
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:42,446
your app.


83
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:45,166
Now this works for your app out


84
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,946
of the box and for free if


85
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:48,276
you're using all of our standard


86
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:49,496
foundation APIs for


87
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:50,236
localization.


88
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:51,966
But there are couple things to


89
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:53,336
keep in mind to make this work


90
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:54,446
great for your users.


91
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:58,196
First, do not attempt to set the


92
00:02:58,196 --> 00:02:59,816
application language manually in


93
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:00,166
code.


94
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,806
Our APIs do a lot of work to


95
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:04,036
ensure users get the right


96
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:05,526
language and font fall backs.


97
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:07,956
If you do need to add the option


98
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:08,966
within your app to switch


99
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:10,666
languages, we recommend you


100
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,126
Launch into Settings where users


101
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,216
can go in and switch the


102
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:14,766
language of your app.


103
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,386
Next, when the user does change


104
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:21,366
the language of your app, your


105
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,106
app will be relaunched in the


106
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:23,976
target language.


107
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:25,976
Now, to make this language


108
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:27,616
change a seamless experience for


109
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,436
the user, we recommend you adapt


110
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,946
state restoration APIs.


111
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:34,526
In iOS 13, there are some new


112
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:36,926
state restoration APIs with


113
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,136
NSUserActivity.


114
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:39,596
To learn more about how you can


115
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:40,906
use them, you can check out this


116
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:41,856
talk on Friday.


117
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:45,796
And, finally, it's important


118
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:47,076
that all of your content is


119
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:48,596
shown consistently in one


120
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:49,736
language throughout your app.


121
00:03:50,636 --> 00:03:51,966
If you're doing some custom or


122
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:53,446
server-side resource loading,


123
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,386
there are handful of APIs that


124
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:56,556
might be useful for you to


125
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:57,606
determine which language to


126
00:03:57,606 --> 00:03:58,676
request that content here.


127
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:00,856
Let's go over a few of them.


128
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:04,286
Locale APIs are useful for


129
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,106
fetching the user's Language and


130
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:07,016
Region preferences.


131
00:04:07,826 --> 00:04:09,536
Locale that preferred languages


132
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:11,536
returns a list of languages in


133
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:12,776
order of user preference.


134
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:15,546
Now, this list might be useful


135
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,375
to you if maybe you're building


136
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,315
an app that needs to handle


137
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:21,536
multilingual content, and you


138
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:22,716
need to fetch resources such as


139
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:24,476
font for all of the user's


140
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:24,846
languages.


141
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:27,876
And one thing to know is that


142
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:29,396
locale, that preferred languages


143
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:32,206
will return the language list,


144
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:33,396
that user's preferred languages,


145
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:35,016
regardless of the languages your


146
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:36,356
application bundle supports.


147
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:37,996
So it's not useful for getting


148
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:39,196
the current running application


149
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:39,626
language.


150
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:41,746
To get the current running


151
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:44,066
application language, we can use


152
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,026
Bundle APIs.


153
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,466
And Bundle APIs are useful for


154
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:48,606
language matching.


155
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:51,006
Bundle.main.preferred


156
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:53,306
Localizations considers both the


157
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:55,716
user preferred languages and the


158
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:57,096
languages that your application


159
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,896
bundle supports and returns a


160
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:00,096
list of languages your


161
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:01,766
application Bundle supports in


162
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:02,806
order of user preference.


163
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:05,486
Now, if you have an external


164
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:06,526
list, say if you're loading some


165
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:08,226
remote content from a server and


166
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,166
your server has a different


167
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,646
setup supported languages, you


168
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:11,786
can use the class method


169
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:13,466
Bundle.preferredLocalizations


170
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:13,806
from.


171
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:15,706
And this will also consider that


172
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,866
third language from your server.


173
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:20,956
Now, to help walk you through


174
00:05:20,956 --> 00:05:22,786
this feature and what it means


175
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:24,286
for your apps, I'd love to jump


176
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:24,886
in to a demo.


177
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:28,500
[ Applause ]


178
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:37,706
OK. So, last year, we demo'd


179
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:38,576
Vacation Planet.


180
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:40,806
The first Interplanetary Travel


181
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,266
Booking app, and we've since


182
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,586
expanded the app to be able to


183
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:44,736
book complete travel


184
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:45,416
experiences.


185
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,526
We had this new Discover tab


186
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:48,766
with the collection view that


187
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,266
shows some of our great


188
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,546
offerings in these thumbnails


189
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:55,256
like this romantic space cruise


190
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:58,726
to Pluto or Moon Yoga.


191
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:02,236
Now, some of these are seasonal


192
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,876
offerings like this WWDC


193
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:04,526
Afterparty.


194
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:06,286
And because this is seasonal


195
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:07,266
offering this content is


196
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,726
actually pulled from our server.


197
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,426
So this image and this great


198
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:11,336
description about how this is


199
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:12,846
the first Interstellar Bash and


200
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:14,426
how we're going to be going on a


201
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:15,856
onboard-- we're going to be


202
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:17,836
going on a ship with an onboard


203
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,756
seafood restaurant, the Codable,


204
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:22,736
is actually being pulled from


205
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:23,366
our server.


206
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:25,406
Now, after reading that


207
00:06:25,406 --> 00:06:26,676
description, I think this looks


208
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:27,886
great and I'm ready to book.


209
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:30,966
But as you know, WWDC attendees


210
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,336
has come from all around the


211
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:34,106
world and they might prefer to


212
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:35,386
do their travel booking in a


213
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:36,156
different language.


214
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:37,986
So, what I'm going to do is I'm


215
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,006
going to go down to the profile


216
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:40,406
tab where we have a table view


217
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:41,656
cell that shows the current


218
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:42,886
running application language.


219
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,036
And when I click on that, it's


220
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:46,086
going to pop me right into


221
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:47,156
Settings where I can click in to


222
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,846
see a list of all the languages


223
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:49,946
my application supports.


224
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:51,426
I'm going to go ahead and change


225
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:52,026
this to French.


226
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:53,696
And when I go back, you can see


227
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,446
that the System UI is still in


228
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:57,116
English but when I go back to


229
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,846
Vacation Planet, the app will


230
00:06:58,846 --> 00:07:00,666
relaunch and it'll be in French.


231
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:04,996
[ Applause ]


232
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:06,976
Now, one thing you'll notice is


233
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,016
that it actually brought me


234
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:09,066
right back to where I left it


235
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,076
and that's because I've adapted


236
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:11,856
those state restoration APIs.


237
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,376
And you can see now all of our


238
00:07:14,506 --> 00:07:15,616
strings and all of our date


239
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:16,896
formatters are in French which


240
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:17,716
is great.


241
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:19,616
But when I go to that server


242
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,156
side loaded content, I can see


243
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:22,606
that that is still in English.


244
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:24,236
Now that seems problematic


245
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,406
because we want to be consistent


246
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:26,526
in our app and we want their app


247
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,596
to be in one language.


248
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:29,706
So, let's take a look of what


249
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:32,146
might be going on there.


250
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,566
So, I'm here in our Collection


251
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,706
View Controller and I have this


252
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,376
method Local Discover Items that


253
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,976
downloads that content from the


254
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:39,416
server.


255
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,666
And when we download that


256
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,646
content, we actually need to


257
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:42,966
pass in a language because the


258
00:07:43,026 --> 00:07:44,386
server needs to know what


259
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:45,496
language are we fetching that


260
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:46,116
content in.


261
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:47,956
And here you can see that the


262
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:48,906
language I'm passing in is


263
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:50,766
Locale.preferredLanguages.first.


264
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:52,306
As I mentioned before,


265
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,706
Locale.preferredLanguages going


266
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,926
to return the users preferred


267
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:57,106
languages regardless of the


268
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:58,246
language that my application


269
00:07:58,296 --> 00:07:58,676
supports.


270
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:00,466
And so, this could be something


271
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:01,906
like Persian that my application


272
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:03,116
doesn't necessarily support.


273
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,896
Now, ideally, I'd like something


274
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:07,026
that I'll consider the server


275
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:08,336
support languages, my


276
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:09,556
application bundle supported


277
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,076
languages, in order of the


278
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:12,086
user's preferences.


279
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:14,046
So, I'm going to start by


280
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,636
fetching the server's supported


281
00:08:16,636 --> 00:08:17,116
languages.


282
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,446
You can see that here.


283
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:20,126
And then I'm going to use that


284
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:22,216
Bundle API, that class method on


285
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:23,946
Bundle.preferredLocalizations


286
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,806
from, and I'll pass in the


287
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,186
availableServerLocalizations.


288
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:28,986
And now the first element of


289
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,556
this will be the best language


290
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:33,626
to request that content and from


291
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:35,905
the server.


292
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,546
So I went ahead and I rebuilt.


293
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,136
And wait a couple of seconds for


294
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:45,926
it to relaunch.


295
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:48,326
And you can see now that image


296
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:49,626
and all of that content is in


297
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:49,826
French.


298
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:50,866
Isn't that great [applause]?


299
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,016
Cool, so, I'm ready to book and


300
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:53,956
I can't wait to see you guys all


301
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:54,876
at this Interstellar Bash.


302
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:56,996
All right.


303
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:59,876
So, to summarize, App Language


304
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:02,146
Setting allows users to choose a


305
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:04,186
language for your app.


306
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:06,516
Launching to Settings is the


307
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:08,556
best way to allow your users to


308
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:09,656
switch the language of your app.


309
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,886
Use state restoration to make


310
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,266
that language switch a seamless


311
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:15,736
experience for the user.


312
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,786
And, finally, if you're doing


313
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:19,046
some custom or server-side


314
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:20,756
resource loading, be sure you're


315
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:22,426
using the right bundle or locale


316
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,666
API for your use case.


317
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:28,076
I'm incredibly excited for all


318
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:29,046
of the great features and


319
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:30,196
enhancements we've worked on


320
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:32,236
this year and can't wait to see


321
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:33,096
how you're going to bring your


322
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:34,236
apps to an international


323
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:34,596
audience.


324
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:37,446
Now to tell you how we've made


325
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:38,566
it easier for you to do just


326
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:39,756
that, I'd like to call up


327
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:40,366
Vivian.


328
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:40,856
Vivian?


329
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:46,106
[ Applause ]


330
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:47,506
>> Thanks Kulpreet.


331
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:48,946
So, let's talk about some of the


332
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:50,746
enhancements that localization


333
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:53,786
tooling in Xcode.


334
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,216
And this year, we've done a lot


335
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:56,546
of things you've been asking


336
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,316
for, so this is going to read a


337
00:09:58,316 --> 00:09:59,936
little like a wish list.


338
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:03,006
First up, performance.


339
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:05,566
So, I'm very excited to announce


340
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:07,636
that exporting projects with


341
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:09,746
lots of Interface Builder files


342
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:12,146
for localization is now on


343
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:15,976
average, 15 times faster.


344
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:19,676
[ Applause ]


345
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:21,536
So, this means if you had a


346
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:22,996
project that was taking about a


347
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:25,406
minute, that's going to be down


348
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:25,976
to four seconds.


349
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:31,246
And we did this by redesigning


350
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:33,046
the string extraction process,


351
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,866
so the more Interface Builder


352
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:37,416
files you have, the bigger an


353
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,236
improvement you're going to see.


354
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:41,326
Also to really speed up and


355
00:10:41,326 --> 00:10:43,446
streamline your workflow, don't


356
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,476
bother with calling genstrings


357
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:48,716
or ibtool directly, instead use


358
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:51,316
xcodebuild, exportlocalizations,


359
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:53,356
and importlocalizations to take


360
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:54,306
care of creating all of your


361
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,226
strings files.


362
00:10:56,386 --> 00:11:00,096
Next up. iPad apps for Mac, so


363
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:02,066
you may be really excited about


364
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,836
bringing your iPad apps to Mac,


365
00:11:04,646 --> 00:11:06,406
but maybe you have some strings


366
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:08,546
that wouldn't make sense, and


367
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:10,736
maybe something it says, tap


368
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,266
here but the user would now be


369
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,016
using a mouse with a cursor,


370
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:16,476
maybe clicking, or here in news,


371
00:11:16,746 --> 00:11:18,356
you can control Siri's


372
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:20,516
suggestions in Settings, if


373
00:11:20,516 --> 00:11:22,946
you're on the iPad, but that


374
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:25,226
would be the apps preferences on


375
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:25,586
a Mac.


376
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:29,616
And, of course, you want to have


377
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,656
that one NSLocalizedString


378
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:34,526
called it's already in code.


379
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:37,226
So, to help with this, we're


380
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:39,466
introducing a new stringsdict


381
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:41,356
rule for device-specific


382
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:42,076
strings.


383
00:11:43,346 --> 00:11:45,266
And this rule can be combined


384
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:47,106
with the plural and variable


385
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:47,746
width rules.


386
00:11:47,746 --> 00:11:49,466
So, you can use this for any of


387
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,546
your existing strings even if


388
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:53,466
they're already in a stringsdict


389
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:53,886
file.


390
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:57,256
So, the new rule is


391
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:59,476
NSStringDeviceSpecificRuleType


392
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,556
and the supported device keys


393
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:06,906
are apppletv, applewatch, ipad,


394
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:10,476
iphone, ipod and mac.


395
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:13,116
So, it's not just for iPad apps


396
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:14,746
on Mac.


397
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,816
And your stringsdict will look


398
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,706
something like this, at the top,


399
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,026
your existing string key then


400
00:12:22,026 --> 00:12:22,756
the new rule


401
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:25,126
NSStringDeviceSpecificRuleType


402
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:27,836
and inside a dictionary, with


403
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:29,536
all of your device specific


404
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:32,046
strings index by those device


405
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:32,326
keys.


406
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:35,266
For more on iPad apps for Mac,


407
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:36,696
please check out the session


408
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:38,456
Taking iPad Apps For Mac to the


409
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:39,146
Next Level.


410
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:43,236
Next up. Settings bundle.


411
00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:46,386
Settings Bundles are now


412
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:47,816
included in your Xcode


413
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:48,976
Localization Catalogs.


414
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:51,506
So these are as easy to localize


415
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:52,856
as anything else in your


416
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:53,296
project.


417
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,316
And one of the more significant


418
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:58,036
improvements we made to the


419
00:12:58,036 --> 00:13:00,696
localization tooling in Xcode is


420
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,586
in how you localize Assets.


421
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:06,196
So until now, in order to


422
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:08,046
localize an image it needed to


423
00:13:08,046 --> 00:13:10,536
be an independent file in your


424
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:13,156
project and this may have meant


425
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:16,266
you had some files in your Asset


426
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:18,506
Catalog and the localized ones


427
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:19,766
floating around lose.


428
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:22,056
So I'm very excited to announce


429
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:23,626
that starting now you can


430
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:26,086
localize images directly in your


431
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:26,886
Asset Catalog.


432
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,896
[ Applause ]


433
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,546
So, this means you can now


434
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,486
localize your image sets, watch


435
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:40,506
complications, Apple TV image


436
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:44,726
stacks, Sprite atlases, Game


437
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:46,056
Center dashboards and


438
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:48,966
leaderboards, as well as the new


439
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:49,776
symbol sets.


440
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,056
So, let's take a look how you do


441
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:52,276
that.


442
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:56,156
In the Asset Catalog Editor when


443
00:13:56,156 --> 00:13:57,846
you select a supported type in


444
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:00,076
the Attribute Inspector, you'll


445
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:02,016
now find a localized button.


446
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:04,336
Click that and we add the


447
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:05,736
localized of our attribute to


448
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:07,566
the content so adjacent to that


449
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:09,886
asset, you're ready to export an


450
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:11,526
Xcode Localization Catalog.


451
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:14,146
But, say that you're


452
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,186
multilingual and doing some of


453
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:17,976
the localization work yourself


454
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:20,566
or maybe you're moving already


455
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:23,046
localized images into the Asset


456
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,306
Catalog, well, when you click


457
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:26,946
that button, it's going to


458
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:29,516
reveal check boxes with all of


459
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:31,296
the localizations already in


460
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:31,866
your project.


461
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:36,156
Check any of those, and it will


462
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:37,976
create the wells in the Asset


463
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:39,816
Catalog Editor, so you can drag


464
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,766
in the localized images like you


465
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:43,506
would any other asset.


466
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:45,676
Now, what about those new


467
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,246
symbols?


468
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,876
Well, SF system symbols are


469
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:51,386
localized for you, you don't


470
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:52,526
need to do any extra work.


471
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,516
Custom symbols can also be


472
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:56,126
localized.


473
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:57,446
You can either set the


474
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:59,246
directionality, if you just need


475
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:00,696
them to flip for right-to-left


476
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:01,856
languages like Arabic and


477
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:04,256
Hebrew, or you can do a full


478
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:06,276
localization cycle in the same


479
00:15:06,276 --> 00:15:07,766
workflow as images.


480
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:09,406
You'll find the same localized


481
00:15:09,406 --> 00:15:10,566
button in the Attribute


482
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:11,106
Inspector.


483
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:13,506
For more on symbols, please


484
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:14,366
check out the session


485
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:16,436
Introducing SF Symbols later


486
00:15:16,436 --> 00:15:16,886
today.


487
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:20,286
And with that I'd like to show


488
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,646
you all this live in the demo.


489
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:27,316
[ Applause ]


490
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:29,386
Now, you may have notice in


491
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,186
Kulpreet's demo that we had not


492
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:32,426
localized the rest of these


493
00:15:32,426 --> 00:15:34,276
images, so I'm going to do that


494
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:34,596
now.


495
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:37,436
If I go into Xcode, I can go to


496
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,436
my asset catalog and let's fix


497
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:40,796
up this nice yoga image.


498
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:43,486
It's a very nice yoga retreat on


499
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:44,836
the moon where you can feel


500
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:47,026
lighter, mentally and


501
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:47,606
physically.


502
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:50,216
So, I just go over to the


503
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,996
Attribute Inspector, click


504
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:56,346
localized, save, and that one is


505
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:56,906
ready to go.


506
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:59,076
I've already done this for my


507
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:02,316
other vacation packages but I


508
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:04,866
have one image that's already


509
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:06,216
localized and I want to move


510
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,406
into my Asset Catalog to take


511
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:09,736
advantage of all the great


512
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,946
features of Asset Catalogs like


513
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:13,096
being able to specify a


514
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:14,466
different appearance for Dark


515
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:14,766
mode.


516
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:17,716
This is super easy, I just grab


517
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:19,656
my old image and drag in to the


518
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:20,456
Asset Catalog.


519
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:23,626
Xcode has created a new image


520
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:26,786
set with the same name as my old


521
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:27,326
resource.


522
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:29,276
So I don't even need to go make


523
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:30,966
a change in my storyboard, it


524
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:31,986
will just work.


525
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:33,806
Now, I want to bring my


526
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,726
localizations along too, so I


527
00:16:35,726 --> 00:16:38,736
click localized, check off the


528
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:40,756
existing language and I'll drag


529
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:44,296
that one into place, and save.


530
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:46,696
And I can just delete the old


531
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:49,546
one, from my project and on


532
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:49,826
disk.


533
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:53,436
OK, so everything is ready.


534
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:55,826
I can now export an Xcode


535
00:16:55,826 --> 00:16:56,906
Localization Catalog.


536
00:16:57,646 --> 00:16:59,226
This is the same workflow as


537
00:16:59,266 --> 00:16:59,876
Xcode 10.


538
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,346
I select the project, go to


539
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:04,955
Editor, export for localization.


540
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:09,606
And let's just do French for


541
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:10,986
now, I don't need the rest of


542
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:11,205
these.


543
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,195
OK, export.


544
00:17:15,806 --> 00:17:19,715
Let's see what we got.


545
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:21,886
OK, here is my Xcode


546
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:23,506
Localization Catalog and I can


547
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:24,675
just send this off to my


548
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,665
localizers and I'll find my


549
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:27,336
localizer.


550
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,966
I'm going to pop this open and I


551
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,946
know I can dive right into


552
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:33,896
Localize Contents and get to


553
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:34,306
work.


554
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:36,696
So, what do we got here, OK,


555
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:38,706
here is the xliff, I know what


556
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:40,006
to do with that, I know it has


557
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:41,446
all the strings for the project


558
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:43,236
but what else is here?


559
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:46,306
OK, we have an Asset Catalog.


560
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:49,526
And this is a fully formed Asset


561
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:49,996
Catalog.


562
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:51,456
I could go drag this into


563
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,176
another Xcode project and use


564
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:53,386
it.


565
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,316
But this one has been filtered


566
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:57,736
down to only what the localizer


567
00:17:57,836 --> 00:17:58,486
cares about.


568
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:00,556
So, it's only the localizable


569
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:02,796
content and only for this


570
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:03,666
locale.


571
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:06,056
Now, in this case, we don't have


572
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:08,506
any French images yet, so


573
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,716
[inaudible] on here, it's just


574
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,046
the copy of the English.


575
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,586
This is for the convenience with


576
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:14,306
the localizer.


577
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:16,046
They can just jump in, start


578
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:16,416
editing.


579
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:19,126
Save time, I've had some


580
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:20,916
localizers do exactly that for


581
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:21,126
me.


582
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,996
So, let's see what they sent


583
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:23,246
back.


584
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,546
Just go open the catalog in my


585
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:27,126
favorite localization tool here.


586
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:34,346
And we can see side-by-side the


587
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:36,766
English and French versions of


588
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:39,026
all images there is yoga, yup.


589
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:42,546
OK. Let's import this into the


590
00:18:42,546 --> 00:18:45,216
project, go back to Xcode, again


591
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:47,486
same workflow as Xcode 10,


592
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,146
select the project, go to


593
00:18:49,146 --> 00:18:51,646
Editor, import localizations,


594
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:53,866
select that finished Xcode


595
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,316
Localization Catalog and click


596
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:58,496
Import, great.


597
00:18:58,496 --> 00:18:59,686
So, now, I have to go to my


598
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:04,686
asset catalog, I can see, I now


599
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,486
have two versions of my image in


600
00:19:07,486 --> 00:19:08,956
here all in one place.


601
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,866
[ Applause ]


602
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:14,136
But, it's kind of small, so


603
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,306
let's run the app again, so we


604
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:16,366
can see that a little bigger.


605
00:19:20,046 --> 00:19:21,896
So, this time when we go back to


606
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:24,146
the app, we should see all of


607
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:27,166
our vacation packages now with


608
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:28,076
the French titles.


609
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:35,496
There we go, beautiful.


610
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:41,176
[ Applause ]


611
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:44,976
OK. Let's go back to the slides.


612
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,746
So, we just saw some of the


613
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:51,426
enhancements to localization


614
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:52,726
tooling in Xcode.


615
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:55,176
Export and import of interface


616
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:57,026
Builder files is now a lot


617
00:19:57,106 --> 00:19:57,536
faster.


618
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:00,356
There's a new stringsdict rule


619
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:03,816
for device-specific strings.


620
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:05,566
Settings Bundle is now easy to


621
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:06,146
localize.


622
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:09,766
And symbols and images are


623
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:11,806
localizable in Asset Catalogs.


624
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:13,786
Now, of course, once you've


625
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:15,656
localize your app you're going


626
00:20:15,656 --> 00:20:17,326
to want to test all of those


627
00:20:17,326 --> 00:20:18,326
localizations.


628
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:20,566
And we've made that easier too.


629
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,666
And I'd like to call up Arthur


630
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:23,946
to tell you all about it.


631
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:27,276
[Applause]


632
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:29,976
>> Thanks, Vivian.


633
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:32,216
Now, let's take a look at how


634
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:33,926
you can take advantage of UI


635
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:35,086
testing for localization.


636
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:38,246
Testing is a significant part of


637
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:39,226
any development cycle.


638
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:41,976
It takes time and resources but


639
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:43,066
it's very important to help


640
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:44,586
catch regressions as you add new


641
00:20:44,586 --> 00:20:46,836
features and detect bugs before


642
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:48,316
you release your product to your


643
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:48,726
customers.


644
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,826
If your app support more than


645
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:54,496
one language you will have to


646
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:55,716
test full language specific


647
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:56,036
issues.


648
00:20:56,866 --> 00:21:00,586
Clip strings, truncated content,


649
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:04,186
overlapping layouts or even


650
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:05,586
issues specific to right-to-left


651
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:06,866
languages such as Hebrew,


652
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:07,186
Arabic.


653
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:12,106
Now, if you want to test for


654
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:15,386
every device you support, in


655
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:18,566
every language you support, your


656
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:19,956
test metrics can repeat and


657
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:20,256
explore.


658
00:21:21,836 --> 00:21:23,636
You can easily end up with


659
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:24,616
thousands of different


660
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:24,956
scenarios.


661
00:21:26,236 --> 00:21:27,166
And that will make it really


662
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,586
difficult for your testers to


663
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:29,626
cover all these scenarios


664
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:29,936
manually.


665
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:32,136
So, it's even more important to


666
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:34,016
include test in your project to


667
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,146
help produce manual work load


668
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:36,496
for your QA.


669
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:40,936
In Xcode 11, we made it easier


670
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:42,686
for you to cover all of this


671
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:44,196
test automatically with test


672
00:21:44,706 --> 00:21:44,976
plans.


673
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:49,206
[ Applause ]


674
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:51,316
Test plan is a very easy way to


675
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:53,126
run the same tests multiple


676
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:54,546
times using different


677
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,176
configurations.


678
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:57,456
I'm not going to go too much


679
00:21:57,456 --> 00:21:58,616
into details about test plans


680
00:21:58,616 --> 00:21:58,866
today.


681
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:00,576
So please check out the Testing


682
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:01,866
in Xcode session on Thursday


683
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:04,136
morning to learn more about it.


684
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,616
What we will be covering is how


685
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,726
you can use test plans in your


686
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:10,546
localization workflow.


687
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:14,526
So, first, we will see how you


688
00:22:14,526 --> 00:22:15,616
can make sure that your test


689
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:18,916
localization friendly, then


690
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:20,466
we'll talk about how you can use


691
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,466
test plans to generate localized


692
00:22:23,196 --> 00:22:23,476
screenshots.


693
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,256
And, finally, we will go over


694
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:27,806
some of the many use cases for


695
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,376
those screenshots, because


696
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,566
they're not only good for


697
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:31,686
testing.


698
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:36,316
First, let's see how we can make


699
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:37,876
sure that your test can work in


700
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:38,916
every language you run them in.


701
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,026
To do so, you should rely on


702
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:44,236
Accessibility Identifiers.


703
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:47,056
These identifiers are unique,


704
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:49,856
stable, and we'll guarantee that


705
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,236
your test can run in any


706
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:51,626
language.


707
00:22:53,626 --> 00:22:55,696
You can easily set them up,


708
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:56,776
setting the property of the same


709
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:59,796
name in code or if you're using


710
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:01,246
interface Builder to create your


711
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,626
UI element, you can define them


712
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:04,796
right there in the Identity


713
00:23:04,796 --> 00:23:08,966
Inspector, and that's all it


714
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:09,336
takes.


715
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:10,626
So, now, that your test are


716
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:12,656
localization friendly, let's see


717
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:13,826
how we can use them to Generate


718
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:14,606
Localized Screenshots.


719
00:23:16,716 --> 00:23:18,576
As I mentioned earlier in your


720
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:20,376
test plan you can create


721
00:23:20,376 --> 00:23:21,486
multiple configuration.


722
00:23:24,596 --> 00:23:26,116
In each of this configuration


723
00:23:27,096 --> 00:23:28,396
you can set a different language


724
00:23:28,486 --> 00:23:29,886
and a different region to run


725
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:30,346
your testing.


726
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:35,886
Then by simply turning on the


727
00:23:35,886 --> 00:23:37,396
Localization Screenshots option


728
00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:40,096
in the UI testing section, your


729
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:41,626
screenshots will be persisted


730
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:43,886
and there's so much you can do


731
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,086
with them.


732
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:47,136
Well, some of this option


733
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:48,486
available in the Scheme Editor


734
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:49,996
that we already-- you already


735
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,376
know and use in case you haven't


736
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:56,566
market it to test plans yet.


737
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:57,926
And now that your tests are set


738
00:23:57,926 --> 00:23:58,696
up to capture Localized


739
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:00,336
Screenshots, let's see what we


740
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:00,886
can do with them.


741
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:02,526
They're actually a great


742
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,396
marketing resource.


743
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,286
You can pass them along to your


744
00:24:05,286 --> 00:24:07,516
marketing team or even upload


745
00:24:07,516 --> 00:24:08,966
them to the App Store to


746
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:11,396
showcase your latest design.


747
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:12,626
You can use them in your


748
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:14,096
documentation or in your


749
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:14,526
tutorials.


750
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,706
But more importantly they can


751
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:21,296
help your localizers get the


752
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:23,106
context they need to provide you


753
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:24,696
with high quality localization.


754
00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:27,656
Let's take a quick example.


755
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:31,596
A simple word like Start in


756
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,616
English could either be a verb


757
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:36,426
meaning to begin or it could be


758
00:24:36,426 --> 00:24:37,736
a noun and referred to the


759
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:38,526
beginning of an event.


760
00:24:39,656 --> 00:24:41,066
While this difference might seem


761
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:42,546
really subtle in English, it can


762
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:43,676
lead to widely different


763
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:44,586
localizations in other


764
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:45,226
languages.


765
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:48,586
Here, we can see it's a noun

00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,526
because it's labeling the


767
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:50,886
starting date.


768
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:53,776
Giving this visual context to


769
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:55,536
your localizers we'll alleviate


770
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,096
the ambiguity and make sure that


771
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:58,146
you get the most accurate


772
00:24:58,146 --> 00:24:58,756
localization.


773
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:03,706
Last year, we introduced the


774
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:04,836
Xcode Localization Catalog.


775
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,226
It's a very common way to handle


776
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:10,446
localizing both strings and


777
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:12,786
non-string based resources all


778
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:14,556
in one place.


779
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:17,696
In it we included the Notes


780
00:25:17,696 --> 00:25:19,546
directory, specifically for you


781
00:25:19,546 --> 00:25:20,636
to include contextual


782
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:22,346
information such as screenshots


783
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:25,206
for your localizers.


784
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,366
This year, I'm very happy to say


785
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,646
that we are automatically


786
00:25:29,646 --> 00:25:30,906
including these screenshots for


787
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,346
you in the Xcode Localization


788
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:32,976

single click during the Export

00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:43,196
Localization Workflow that


793
00:25:43,196 --> 00:25:44,596
you're already using.


794
00:25:46,036 --> 00:25:48,376
If you rely on automation to


795
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:49,296
generate your Localization


796
00:25:49,296 --> 00:25:51,186
Catalog, you can simply add the


797
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:52,656
include screenshots argument to


798
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:53,466
your xcodebuild

exportLocalizations command.


800
00:25:55,396 --> 00:25:58,546
You can also customize which


801
00:25:58,546 --> 00:25:59,446
screenshots I exported.


802
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:01,276
We made it easier for you to


803
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:03,126
specify which test targets,


804
00:26:03,336 --> 00:26:05,676
devices and languages I exported


805
00:26:05,886 --> 00:26:06,856
to Localization Catalog.


806
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:11,396
But that might be a lot of


807
00:26:11,396 --> 00:26:13,056
screenshots for your localizers


808
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:14,986
to come through to see exactly


809
00:26:14,986 --> 00:26:16,466
what Strings shows on the UI.


810
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:20,186
So, alongside every Localized


811
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:21,976
Screenshot that we generate, we


812
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:23,466
also generate a metadata.plist,


813
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:25,626
mapping the strings to the exact


814
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,976
location on the screenshots.


815
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,166
This plist include the strings


816
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,996
IDs, the ones that you can find


817
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:35,196
in the Eclipse but also the


818
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:37,286
framing formation, which is the


819
00:26:37,286 --> 00:26:39,256
exact location of the Strings on


820
00:26:39,256 --> 00:26:39,726
the screenshots.


821
00:26:41,276 --> 00:26:42,836
This makes it really easy for


822
00:26:42,836 --> 00:26:44,276
localization tools to map the


823
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:46,336
Strings to the Eclipse and


824
00:26:46,336 --> 00:26:48,186
highlight them directly on the


825
00:26:48,836 --> 00:26:49,116
screenshots.


826
00:26:50,196 --> 00:26:51,506
And once you export your


827
00:26:51,506 --> 00:26:53,576
localization catalog, this new


828
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:55,256
content is neatly organized in


829
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:57,036
the Notes directory and the


830
00:26:57,036 --> 00:26:59,006
metadata.plist consolidated into


831
00:26:59,006 --> 00:27:01,026
one for test targets and device.


832
00:27:02,346 --> 00:27:04,536
And this is how easy it is to

>> Thanks Arthur.


841
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:25,156
So, now that we've localized our


842
00:27:25,156 --> 00:27:26,826
app, we want to test those


843
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:27,806
Localizations.


844
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:33,906
All right.


845
00:27:34,706 --> 00:27:36,856
So, I've already created some UI


846
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,606
tests for my project here.


847
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,576
I have some here that will


848
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,576
capture all of my screens, which


849
00:27:44,716 --> 00:27:46,206
I think would be really helpful


850
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,226
for giving to my localizers for


851
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:48,686
context.


852
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:51,556
And I have another test that


853
00:27:51,556 --> 00:27:53,216
just zips in there and gets a


854
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,286
picture of those nice vacation


855
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:56,676
package images, which I think


856
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:57,806
would be good for marketing.


857
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:00,556
But I want to run all of these


858
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:03,246
test in all the localizations I


859
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:03,816
support.


860
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,756
And that could take some time


861
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:07,496
which is where test plans comes


862
00:28:07,496 --> 00:28:07,976
in handy.


863
00:28:07,976 --> 00:28:09,466
So you can add a test plan to


864
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:10,816
your project like any other


865
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:11,196
file.


866
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:14,306
File, New, File, and there's a


867
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:15,776
template for it, so I can just


868
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:17,066
search for plan.


869
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:17,476
There it is.


870
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:19,636
You can also, migrate your


871
00:28:19,636 --> 00:28:21,816
existing test to test plans.


872
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:23,136
Let's save time.


873
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:24,446
I've already made one.


874
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:27,906
So, let's take a look.


875
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,516
OK. So I have two test targets


876
00:28:30,516 --> 00:28:30,806
here.


877
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:33,396
I have one that will run all of


878
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:36,786
my screens tests and another


879
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:37,996
that's just going to capture


880
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:39,766
that marketing image.


881
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:42,276
I also have some configuration


882
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:42,706
setup.


883
00:28:43,206 --> 00:28:44,956
The important thing here is in


884
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,226

00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:50,386
turned on.


887
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,756
So, I've got one configuration


888
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:55,586
for English, United States and


889
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,736
another for Swedish, Sweden.


890
00:28:58,816 --> 00:29:00,496
So, since I've just got those


891
00:29:00,496 --> 00:29:02,046
images in French, I'm going to


892
00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:03,336
add one for French.


893
00:29:03,796 --> 00:29:04,806
Just click Plus.


894
00:29:05,616 --> 00:29:07,966
Let's call this one French,


895
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:08,706
France.


896
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:14,266
OK. And we will set the


897
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:17,586
application language to French


898
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:20,806
and the application region to


899
00:29:21,446 --> 00:29:21,756
France.


900
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:25,506
OK. It's now-- I think, I'll


901
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:27,506
rerun just the test to get that


902
00:29:27,506 --> 00:29:28,336
marketing image.


903
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:29,846
So, I can get a picture of those


904
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:31,836
newly localized French images.


905
00:29:32,486 --> 00:29:35,556
So, I go back to my UI test in


906
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:36,146
order to run it.


907
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:37,816
And now, when I click the test


908
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:40,346
diamond, instead of running my


909
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:42,436
test once, it's going to run it


910
00:29:42,806 --> 00:29:44,426
with all of my configurations


911
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:45,666
and we can actually watch as it


912
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,606
goes through all of this.


913
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:49,196
So, it's going to run three


914
00:29:49,196 --> 00:29:53,696
times, English and then Swedish


915
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:55,696
except my localizers aren't


916
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:55,936
done.


917
00:29:55,936 --> 00:29:56,996
So, we'll probably going to see


918
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:58,756
some English strings again and


919
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:00,556
then one last time in French.


920
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,436
And I know that this will work


921
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:05,436
because I use accessibility


922
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,056
identifiers like Arthur said.


923
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,896
So my test will work with all


924
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:10,526
three language configurations.


925
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:12,686
All right.


926
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:16,626
Here we go again.


927
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:18,876
French, OK, great.


928
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:21,586
So let's see what we got here.


929
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,516
OK. If I look at the test that I


930
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:25,106
just ran.


931
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:28,236
OK. I can see it run, it's on my


932
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:30,026
configurations and if I check


933
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:32,296
out French and look at my


934
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:32,956
attachment.


935
00:30:34,216 --> 00:30:34,866
Beautiful.


936
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:36,206
So, I can use this one for


937
00:30:36,206 --> 00:30:36,766
marketing.


938
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:39,756
But my localizers are waiting


939
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:41,266
for an update on Swedish that


940
00:30:41,266 --> 00:30:42,386
they can finish that.


941
00:30:42,856 --> 00:30:45,206
So I need to send them a fresh


942
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:48,096
Xcode Localization Catalog and I


943
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,556
want to make sure that they get


944
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,636
that really tricky start string,


945
00:30:51,636 --> 00:30:51,956
right.


946
00:30:52,146 --> 00:30:53,706
So, let's make sure they get a


947
00:30:53,706 --> 00:30:54,246
screenshot.


948
00:30:54,776 --> 00:30:57,576
I ran my test earlier for it to


949
00:30:57,576 --> 00:30:58,906
capture all of my screens.


950
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:01,376
So, if I look at the Swedish


951
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:05,236
one-- let's see if we can find


952
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:07,086
that tricky start string.


953
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:09,366
I think it's down here.


954
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,006
Yeah. There we go.


955
00:31:11,006 --> 00:31:12,216
OK. So they haven't translated


956
00:31:12,216 --> 00:31:14,396
Start yet or End and they got


957
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:15,276
Travelers.


958
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:19,936
And also in here I have that


959
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,836
plist with the frame information


960
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:24,336
which should be useful.


961
00:31:25,806 --> 00:31:28,366
So, I'm now ready to export an


962
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:29,626
Xcode Localization Catalog.


963
00:31:30,406 --> 00:31:32,066
Select the project, go to


964
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:34,566
Editor, export localization.


965
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:37,596
And this time, I'm going to do


966
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:41,226
Swedish and importantly I'm


967
00:31:41,226 --> 00:31:42,946
going to click Include


968
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:43,696
screenshots.


969
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:45,346
All right.


970
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:46,996
Xcode has found I have 19


971
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:47,986
screenshots available.


972
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:49,226
Let's see exactly what I have


973
00:31:49,226 --> 00:31:49,526
here.


974
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:51,796
If I click customize, I can see


975
00:31:52,476 --> 00:31:54,776
I ran my test with iPhone 8


976
00:31:54,886 --> 00:31:56,966
Plus, 10R and 10S.


977
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:59,176
So, if there's any layout issues


978
00:31:59,256 --> 00:32:01,576
that might catch some of those.


979
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:02,466
OK. I'm definitely going to keep


980
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:03,196
all of those.


981
00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:08,616
And, now, I'm ready to export.


982
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:16,276
OK. So, now, if I look at my new


983
00:32:16,276 --> 00:32:20,316
Localization Catalog, now in the


984
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:22,176
Notes directory I have


985
00:32:22,586 --> 00:32:23,286
screenshots.


986
00:32:24,396 --> 00:32:26,106
And here I can see I have all of


987
00:32:26,106 --> 00:32:28,546
my screenshots organized by test


988
00:32:28,806 --> 00:32:30,206
target and device.


989
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:31,916
So, actually, I'm going to pull


990
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,866
the marketing ones out for later


991
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:36,606
and just send the rest to my


992
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:37,316
Localizers.


993
00:32:38,046 --> 00:32:41,626
So we look in here, we can see I


994
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,506
have all of my screenshots.


995
00:32:45,236 --> 00:32:48,976
OK. There's that tricky start


996
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:50,746
string and actually worst than


997
00:32:50,866 --> 00:32:53,146
Start, you can see in this one


998
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:54,416
screenshot, we have the string


999
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:58,346
Book, one, two, three times.


1000
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:03,896
So that plist with the frame


1001
00:33:03,896 --> 00:33:05,036
informations can be really


1002
00:33:05,036 --> 00:33:05,526
useful.


1003
00:33:05,856 --> 00:33:07,566
And this is the consolidated


1004
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:09,116
plist, so it has the frame


1005
00:33:09,116 --> 00:33:10,916
information for all of the


1006
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:13,256
strings captured in this entire


1007
00:33:13,256 --> 00:33:15,076
set of screenshots.


1008
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:18,056
So, they're really handy because


1009
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,356
now when I'm on localizer I can


1010
00:33:20,356 --> 00:33:22,246
open the catalog in my favorite


1011
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:23,326
Localization Tool.


1012
00:33:23,326 --> 00:33:29,386
And now, I can preview where


1013
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:30,406
string shows up.


1014

[ Applause ]


1015
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:38,066
And not only can I see one place


1016
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:40,296
where a string shows, it will


1017
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:42,586
show me all of the screenshots


1018
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:43,846
that capture the given string.


1019
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:48,006
So, my localizers are going to


1020
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:48,716
be thrilled.


1021
00:33:52,036 --> 00:33:53,506
All right, let's wrap things up.


1022
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:59,386
So, today, we saw how users can


1023
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:01,146
run your app in a different


1024
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:02,666
language to their system


1025
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:03,236
language.


1026
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:05,856
We saw a bunch of improvements


1027
00:34:06,536 --> 00:34:08,186
to the localization tooling in


1028
00:34:08,186 --> 00:34:11,596
Xcode, including faster export


1029
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:13,376
of interface Builder files, a


1030
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,676
new stringsdict rule, how easy


1031
00:34:15,676 --> 00:34:17,206
it is to localize your settings


1032
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:18,716
bundle, and of course how you


1033
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:21,456
can now localize images right in


1034
00:34:21,456 --> 00:34:22,466
your Asset Catalog.


1035
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:26,446
We also saw how you can generate


1036
00:34:26,446 --> 00:34:28,846
Localized screenshots with your


1037
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:31,746
Tests and some of the uses for


1038
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,456
those screenshots.
