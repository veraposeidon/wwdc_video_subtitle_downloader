00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:11,956
>> Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,121
[ Applause ]


5
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:16,436
As you just saw, privacy is


6
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:18,736
something people expect, value,


7
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:21,316
and make space for every day.


8
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:23,336
I'm Mark from Privacy


9
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:24,736
Engineering Team at Apple, and


10
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:26,196
with my colleague, Julien, we're


11
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:27,926
thrilled to tell you today about


12
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:29,646
designing for privacy on our


13
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:31,366
platforms and in your


14
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:32,156
applications.


15
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:36,126
Privacy isn't just about closing


16
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:36,606
doors.


17
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:39,516
It's also about opening doors to


18
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:41,086
the trust you build with your


19
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:41,736
customers.


20
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:45,296
Customers have let our devices


21
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:48,586
into their homes, captured the


22
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:50,596
memories in their photos,


23
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:54,486
monitor their health, and


24
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:56,196
transmit their thoughts and


25
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:58,356
emotions, knowing that they are


26
00:00:58,356 --> 00:00:59,726
in control of their data.


27
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:04,976
As Tim said last year, we at


28
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:07,526
Apple can and do provide the


29
00:01:07,596 --> 00:01:09,876
very best to our users while


30
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:11,076
treating their most precious


31
00:01:11,076 --> 00:01:12,776
data like the precious cargo


32
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:13,606
that it is.


33
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:17,066
And if we can do it, then every


34
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:19,206
one of you can, and in today's


35
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:21,746
talk, we'll help you design for


36
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:21,976
privacy.


37
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:28,406
At Apple, privacy starts with


38
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:29,526
data minimization.


39
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:32,756
Examine carefully what data do


40
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:34,066
you need for the functionality


41
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:35,806
of your app, and what data can


42
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:36,396
you edit out?


43
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:40,996
Some of the most interesting and


44
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:42,726
challenging features use


45
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:45,356
sensitive, personal data, and at


46
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,516
Apple, we build these features


47
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:50,126
with on device intelligence, so


48
00:01:50,126 --> 00:01:52,396
your device personalizes itself


49
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:54,756
to you, while Apple doesn't


50
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:55,566
collect this data.


51
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:00,096
When data is shared with Apple,


52
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:01,326
we ask the customer.


53
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:03,626
The customer is always in


54
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,766
control, and they always know


55
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:06,906
what's being shared.


56
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:11,706
And security is foundational.


57
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:13,946
It not only protects people's


58
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:16,166
data on their devices and on our


59
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,886
servers but also enforces both


60
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:21,356
the privacy protections we've


61
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:23,236
built and the choices that


62
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:26,836
people have made.


63
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:27,856
Some companies think that


64
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,766
privacy is just security, that


65
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:32,316
you can use or collect data so


66
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:33,026
long as you protect it.


67
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:35,956
But that's short sighted, as


68
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,866
security alone isn't adequate in


69
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,366
the long run.


70
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,556
You do have a responsibility to


71
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:42,416
protect the data that you


72
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,496
collect, but it's less risky to


73
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:45,866
just not collect it in the first


74
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,196
place.


75
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:50,236
Some other companies define


76
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,276
privacy as just transparency and


77
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:52,676
control.


78
00:02:53,536 --> 00:02:55,026
Let users know what you're doing


79
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,616
with their data, and let them


80
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:58,216
opt out if they don't like it.


81
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:01,516
But this is privacy after the


82
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:04,646
fact, and it forces people to


83
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:06,676
choose between privacy and


84
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:07,286
features.


85
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:09,926
And the burden shouldn't be on


86
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:12,266
individuals to exercise control


87
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:13,556
to get privacy.


88
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:17,176
Because privacy is a fundamental


89
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:17,756
human right.


90
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:20,036
It's essential to the


91
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:21,666
functioning of good societies,


92
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:24,536
and it's too important to not


93
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:26,486
just work in the technologies


94
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:27,206
that we use.


95
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:30,626
That's why at Apple, privacy is


96
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:32,376
designed into our futures.


97
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:34,526
It's [inaudible] how they work,


98
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:36,666
not something added on at the


99
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:36,956
end.


100
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:40,306
At Apple, we challenge ourselves


101
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:42,026
every day to build great


102
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:44,226
features with privacy, and we're


103
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:47,436
confident you can too.


104
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:50,296
In the rest of our talk, we'll


105
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,876
explore privacy and the user


106
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:52,526
experience.


107
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:55,416
Dive into what's new and updated


108
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,566
in frameworks, and then we'll


109
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,426
take a step back and show how


110
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:00,806
you can overcome privacy


111
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,396
challenges through innovation.


112
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:06,046
I'm going to talk about four


113
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,176
user experiences today.


114
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:12,136
First, Sign In with Apple, which


115
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:12,956
allows you to connect your


116
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:14,586
user's experience across


117
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:16,426
platforms without having to


118
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:17,606
store or manage user


119
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:20,745
credentials, and it's a great


120
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:22,366
example of data minimization.


121
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,206
Apple doesn't track how people


122
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:27,266
use your application because


123
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,506
it's none of our business, and


124
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,146
we've pared down the data that


125
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,246
people share through Sign In


126
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:34,036
with Apple to just what's needed


127
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,316
to sign into your application.


128
00:04:36,546 --> 00:04:37,786
So, ask yourself if you really


129
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:39,106
need the customer's name or


130
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:39,876
email address.


131
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:42,886
If you need a name for billing


132
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:44,236
or shipping purposes, you can


133
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:45,506
get it later, for example,


134
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:46,346
through Apple Pay.


135
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:49,226
And if you don't ask for any


136
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:50,996
additional data, the user has


137
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:53,046
just one button to tap, and


138
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:53,706
they're signed into your


139
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:54,206
application.


140
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,766
If you do need to contact the


141
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,316
user, for example, to provide


142
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:00,536
receipts or for account


143
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:02,916
recovery, we provide an easy way


144
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,586
for you to do so.


145
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:07,196
People can be hesitant to share


146
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:08,336
their real email address.


147
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:09,936
We've all seen email lists


148
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:13,686
stolen or resold and then abused


149
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:14,416
by spammers.


150
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:16,526
So people may give you a fake


151
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:18,286
email address or one for an


152
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:20,396
account they never check.


153
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:21,996
You could make the user verify


154
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:23,616
their email at sign-in, but this


155
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:24,536
takes them out of your


156
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:26,556
application, potentially to


157
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:27,306
[inaudible] their spam folder,


158
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:28,756
and that's not a great


159
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:29,386
experience.


160
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:31,796
With sign-in with Apple, you


161
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:33,526
will get a verified email


162
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:35,526
address associated with the


163
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:36,386
user's AppleID.


164
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:40,036
Customers can choose to hide


165
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:41,676
their email address, in which


166
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,056
case you'll get an address


167
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:45,106
managed by Apple through which


168
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:46,756
we relay your emails to the


169
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,176
customer and vice versa.


170
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:50,526
And Apple won't retain emails


171
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:52,436
after we've delivered them.


172
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,636
For each customer, this managed


173
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:56,036
address is different for each


174
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:58,316
developer, so customers are in


175
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,116
control of which developers they


176
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:02,286
want to receive email from, and


177
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:03,866
you're in control of who can


178
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:05,096
send emails to the managed


179
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:06,906
address we provide you, since


180
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:08,266
you can whitelist domains or


181
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,836
addresses that we'll accept


182
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,716
incoming mail from.


183
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:12,946
And because both parties are in


184
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:14,596
control, we think this is your


185
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:16,536
best shot at getting your emails


186
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:17,726
in front of your customer.


187
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:22,306
We understand you face


188
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:23,966
challenges in preventing abuse


189
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:25,386
and fraud from account farming.


190
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,966
And you may want to ask users to


191
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:29,336
fill out a CAPTCHA such as this.


192
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:31,466
But these are cumbersome, and


193
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:32,676
they're difficult to localize


194
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:35,796
and make accessible.


195
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,216
Other alternatives are invasive


196
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:39,316
to user's privacy, such as


197
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,716
trying to reidentify them with


198
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:41,716
personally identifiable


199
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:43,496
information or fingerprinting.


200
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:46,436
With Sign In with Apple, we can


201
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:48,956
leverage on-device intelligence


202
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,466
to provide you with one bit that


203
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,126
indicates a user is likely real.


204
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:56,016
And this flag is supported on


205
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,626
iOS, and we provide it at


206
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,426
account creation.


207
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:03,296
The real user status property of


208
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:05,336
ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential


209
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:06,776
is how you check for this bit.


210
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:09,546
And keep in mind that a new user


211
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:11,596
on a new phone will likely show


212
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:13,326
up as status unknown, so you


213
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:14,676
shouldn't just deny service if


214
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:16,386
you see this state and provide


215
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:17,796
the user and ultimate flow or a


216
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:19,236
way to appeal this


217
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:19,756
determination.


218
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:23,516
So that was Sign In with Apple,


219
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,576
a great privacy friendly single


220
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:26,346
sign on solution.


221
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:29,356
Now, let's talk about location.


222
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:32,046
People are protective of where


223
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:33,606
they are and where they've been.


224
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:38,126
It reveals where we live, places


225
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:40,116
we frequent, our patterns of


226
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:41,466
life, and when those patterns


227
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:42,056
change.


228
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:44,186
Like if you start attending a


229
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:45,436
different set of afterparties


230
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:46,756
this year with a different crowd


231
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:47,076
of people.


232
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:49,836
And in iOS 13, we're making


233
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,836
changes to help users exercise


234
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:53,986
smarter control over when


235
00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:55,056
they're sharing their location.


236
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:58,796
Previously in iOS, there was a


237
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:00,576
one-time prompt for location


238
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:03,646
permissions, and at this point,


239
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:04,876
the user hasn't experienced


240
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:07,386
location in your app before.


241
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,936
So they may select don't allow


242
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,696
and miss out on the value that


243
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:11,996
location can provide in your


244
00:08:11,996 --> 00:08:12,546
application.


245
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:14,976
And while many of you have built


246
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:16,706
experiences to explain your use


247
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:18,276
of location before asking,


248
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:20,206
nothing explains better than


249
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:20,916
using your app.


250
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:23,956
So, in iOS 13 were introducing a


251
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:27,686
new option, Allow Once, giving


252
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:29,916
users the ability to try out


253
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,336
location in your application


254
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,176
before committing to a decision.


255
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:36,446
If the user selects Allow Once,


256
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:38,056
your app will have access to


257
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,566
location, just as if the user


258
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,126
had selected While in Use up


259
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:43,515
until the system no longer


260
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:45,116
considers your app in use.


261
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:46,766
The next time the user launches


262
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:47,786
your app, they'll be asked


263
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:49,816
again, and if they want to give


264
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:51,026
you app access without being


265
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:52,476
asked, they can grant While in


266
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:53,736
Use when they're comfortable


267
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:54,196
doing so.


268
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:56,666
What about Always?


269
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:58,756
The ability to access a user's


270
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:00,296
location always is a very


271
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:02,246
powerful capability, and you


272
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:03,776
just may be surprised if your


273
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,396
app asks for it right away


274
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:06,836
before you've had a chance to


275
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:08,086
demonstrate your app's value,


276
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:10,106
the value of location in your


277
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:11,816
app's value, or why you need it


278
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:12,956
in the background when they're


279
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:15,736
currently using your app.


280
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:18,326
Location prompts in app will now


281
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:21,086
always be for just once or While


282
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:21,526
in Use.


283
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:25,536
If you do request Always, we'll


284
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:27,296
show the same prompt and defer


285
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:28,506
asking for Always.


286
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:31,686
And if a user selects While in


287
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,786
Use, your delegate object will


288
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:35,556
be told you're authorized for


289
00:09:35,556 --> 00:09:36,006
always.


290
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,566
And iOS will continue to


291
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:40,336
generate Always location events


292
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:41,226
for your app, just as it did


293
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:41,646
before.


294
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:45,046
Before we deliver the first


295
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:46,386
Always location event to your


296
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,666
application, we'll then prompt


297
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,276
the user to upgrade from While


298
00:09:50,276 --> 00:09:52,896
in Use to Always, and you'll


299
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:54,226
only get the location event if


300
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:55,666
the user grants us permission.


301
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,836
We'll only ask users while


302
00:09:58,836 --> 00:09:59,986
they're on the home screen, not


303
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:00,706
while they're in another


304
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,416
application, so this may not


305
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:02,976
happen immediately.


306
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:06,886
To provide increased


307
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,916
transparency, we'll periodically


308
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,526
remind the user that your app is


309
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,706
accessing location in the


310
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:12,196
background.


311
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,176
And shortly after upgrade to iOS


312
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:17,196
13, we'll remind the user for


313
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:18,826
all existing apps with Always


314
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:18,976
access.


315
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:23,586
The good news is, there are no


316
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:25,716
capability breaking API changes,


317
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:27,546
but you should test for the new


318
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:29,476
Allow Once and Always behaviors


319
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:31,106
to ensure that your app handles


320
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:32,036
these state transitions


321
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:32,456
gracefully.


322
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:35,516
And if you do use Always data,


323
00:10:35,726 --> 00:10:37,046
now is a good time to ensure


324
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:38,686
that your use of Always provides


325
00:10:38,686 --> 00:10:39,696
clear user value.


326
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:42,076
We think these contextual


327
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,736
prompts will help users make


328
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,736
informed, smarter choices about


329
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:46,646
when they're sharing their


330
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,106
location.


331
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:49,736
Come talk to us at our lab if


332
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,286
you have any questions, check


333
00:10:51,286 --> 00:10:52,566
out the video from What's New in


334
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:54,296
Core Location session in the


335
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:56,026
WWDC app or the Core Location


336
00:10:56,026 --> 00:11:00,696
lab Friday at 1 p.m. The third


337
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:01,886
user experience I'm going to


338
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:03,306
talk about is Bluetooth.


339
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:05,836
You used to only need user


340
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,336
consent if you wanted to share


341
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:08,626
information using


342
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,986
CoreBluetooth's peripheral


343
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:13,716
manager APIs in the background.


344
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,256
IOS 13 will now require user


345
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:17,046
consent if your application uses


346
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:20,136
any CoreBluetooth APIs, and this


347
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:21,556
applies to apps linked against


348
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,966
older SDKs as well.


349
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:26,276
You should provide an


350
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,736
NSBluetoothAlwaysUsage


351
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:29,006
Description purpose string in


352
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:31,356
your Info.plist to help users


353
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:33,336
understand what your app needs


354
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:35,146
Bluetooth for and so they can


355
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:36,976
make an informed choice, and


356
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:38,946
this will be required for all


357
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:41,156
apps linked on or after IOS 13,


358
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,356
or your app will crash.


359
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:44,926
Please refer to our talk last


360
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:46,216
year for tips on how to write a


361
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:49,326
great purpose string.


362
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:50,316
Adoption is easy.


363
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,886
If the user hasn't previously


364
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,546
granted permission, then when


365
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:56,236
your app instantiates a CB


366
00:11:56,236 --> 00:11:58,006
peripheral or central manager


367
00:11:58,006 --> 00:12:01,156
object, iOS will ask the user if


368
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:02,206
they want to allow your app to


369
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:03,656
access Bluetooth APIs.


370
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:06,106
And you can check the new


371
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:07,746
authorization property on the


372
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:09,076
central and peripheral manager


373
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,646
objects for your current


374
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,556
authorization state.


375
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,426
For more information, please


376
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:15,766
check out what's new in


377
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:20,436
CoreBluetooth Friday at 3:20.


378
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:22,016
The last user [inaudible] change


379
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:23,606
is on macOS Catalina, where


380
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,226
we're adding user consent for


381
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:27,736
more types of functionality and


382
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:27,986
data.


383
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:31,206
Last year in macOS Mohave, we


384
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:32,956
protected these resources on the


385
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:34,796
file system and required user


386
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,016
consent to access them.


387
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:38,006
This year we're adding


388
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:39,766
protection to the Desktop,


389
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:41,026
Documents, and Downloads


390
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,796
folders, iCloud Drive and


391
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,416
Third-Party Cloud Storage as


392
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,686
well as Network and Removable


393
00:12:46,686 --> 00:12:47,186
Volumes.


394
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:50,746
In addition, the camera and


395
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:52,106
microphone controls introduce


396
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,446
macOS Mohave or infusing screen


397
00:12:54,446 --> 00:12:56,206
recording and keyboard input


398
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:58,466
monitoring in macOS Catalina as


399
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:00,536
well as user control over


400
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:01,936
synthetic input events and


401
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:02,676
AppleEvents.


402
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:05,416
For more information, check out


403
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,006
advances in macOS security


404
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,346
session in the WWDC app or their


405
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:13,936
lab tomorrow at 2 p.m. Next, I


406
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:16,636
have three new frameworks with


407
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:17,506
new behaviors.


408
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:21,606
First, I have some exciting news


409
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:22,586
for web developers.


410
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:25,476
We introduced Intelligent


411
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:27,606
Tracking Prevention, ITP, two


412
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,626
years ago, to protect against


413
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:31,056
cross-site user tracking.


414
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,886
On by default in Safari, it's


415
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:35,816
had a big impact, and we're


416
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,206
thrilled to see other browsers


417
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:38,966
adopt similar techniques and


418
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:40,326
build consensus against


419
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:41,156
cross-site tracking.


420
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:44,556
We don't, however, believe that


421
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,426
a web without free of tracking


422
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:48,406
is necessarily a web without


423
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:49,266
advertisements.


424
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:51,856
And last year we took a first


425
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:53,036
step in building privacy


426
00:13:53,036 --> 00:13:54,676
friendly ad infrastructure with


427
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:56,716
installed validation, which


428
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:57,966
allows developers to measure


429
00:13:57,966 --> 00:13:59,896
conversions from advertisements


430
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:01,016
to app installs.


431
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:03,606
This year, we're tackling the


432
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:04,486
web.


433
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,266
Privacy Preserving Ad Click


434
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:09,636
Attribution is a new way for


435
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:11,016
advertisers and merchants on the


436
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,806
web to measure the success of


437
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:14,576
their ad campaigns without


438
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:15,966
tracking individual users.


439
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,956
Let's say they sell running


440
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:20,136
shoes on SneakerNet.


441
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,866
I buy ads on search.example, and


442
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,036
I want to know how effective


443
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:27,546
those ads are at driving visits


444
00:14:27,546 --> 00:14:28,606
and purchases to my site.


445
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,606
This used to be done through


446
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:33,356
cross-site tracking, which ITP


447
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:34,196
now blocks.


448
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:38,226
In Privacy Preserving Ad Click


449
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:40,436
Attribution, Safari connects


450
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:43,946
clicks on ads with conversions


451
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:47,666
on the merchant and reports


452
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,936
these attributions to the ad


453
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:49,536
provider.


454
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:52,266
Let's walk through how this


455
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:54,036
happens.


456
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:56,256
Now when a user clicks on an ad


457
00:14:56,256 --> 00:14:57,256
on search.example for


458
00:14:57,256 --> 00:14:59,936
SneakerNet, Safari will remember


459
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:01,126
this for seven days.


460
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,736
And in that seven-day window, if


461
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,026
the user makes a purchase on


462
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:08,046
SneakerNet, the merchant or


463
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:09,936
advertiser can identify this as


464
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:11,986
a potential conversion, and


465
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:13,736
Safari will connect this


466
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:15,326
potential conversion with a


467
00:15:15,376 --> 00:15:17,136
previously stored ad clicks and


468
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,796
record that conversion did occur


469
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:22,456
from search.example to


470
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:24,456
SneakerNet.


471
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:25,836
Safari will then report this


472
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:27,316
conversion as a delayed


473
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:28,256
ephemeral post the


474
00:15:28,256 --> 00:15:29,836
search.example.


475
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:32,526
Adoption is easy.


476
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:34,636
The ad provider just needs to


477
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:36,236
decorate their outgoing link


478
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,806
anchor tags with two new


479
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:40,406
attributes, adDestination, the


480
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,456
site where you expect


481
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:42,536
conversions to occur.


482
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:46,846
Here, SneakerNet.example and the


483
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:47,826
adCampaignID.


484
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,346
Search.example might be running


485
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:51,846
many concurrent ad campaigns for


486
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:54,096
SneakerNet, and the CampaignID


487
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:55,056
allows you to measure them


488
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:55,496
separately.


489
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:59,206
We can detect conversions


490
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:00,656
without any change on the


491
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:02,186
merchant site by leverage


492
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:06,016
existing tracking pixels, which


493
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:07,306
a search provider can then


494
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:08,716
redirect the server side to a


495
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:11,286
well-known URL that identifies


496
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:12,846
the ConversionID as a past


497
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,266
component.


498
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:16,306
Conversions can be anything from


499
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:17,506
putting an item in a shopping


500
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:19,696
cart, to creating an account, to


501
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:21,426
making a purchase, and the


502
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:23,036
ConversionID allows the merchant


503
00:16:23,076 --> 00:16:24,466
to distinguish between these


504
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,416
different Conversion events.


505
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:29,786
To preserve the user's privacy,


506
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:31,956
Safari limits the Campaign and


507
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,976
ConversionIDs each to 64


508
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:34,866
possible values.


509
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:36,966
So, each conversion between an


510
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:39,016
advertiser and merchant can only


511
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:40,786
be linked to 1 of 4000 possible


512
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:40,976
values.


513
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:45,276
Safari will wait 24 to 48 hours


514
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:46,356
before reporting this


515
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:48,506
attribution, both to aggregate


516
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:49,996
multiple Clicks and Conversions


517
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,076
and to prevent correlation with


518
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:53,826
user activity on either site.


519
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:57,036
The Conversion attribution will


520
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:58,236
be reported in an ephemeral


521
00:16:58,236 --> 00:17:00,176
session without any cookies.


522
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:02,896
And Clicks and Conversions are


523
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,286
not recorded in private


524
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:04,685
browsing.


525
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:09,016
Privacy Preserving Ad Click


526
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:11,526
Attribution is available to try


527
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:13,526
out in Safari Technology Preview


528
00:17:13,526 --> 00:17:13,786
83.


529
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:16,156
It will be on by default in iOS


530
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:18,896
13 and macOS Catalina, and we've


531
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:20,646
submitted to W3C for


532
00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:21,996
consideration as a web standard.


533
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:24,136
And you can see more details at


534
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:25,705
webkit.org/blog.


535
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:29,866
Next, I'm going to talk about


536
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:31,276
the Speech Recognizer framework,


537
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,796
which allows you to transcribe


538
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:34,216
audio.


539
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:36,876
We've heard many requests for a


540
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:38,016
way to perform transcription


541
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,866
locally, and this is especially


542
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:41,156
helpful in regulated


543
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:42,306
environments such as healthcare.


544
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:46,116
In iOS 13, we're introducing


545
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:47,976
offline transcription, so you


546
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:49,736
can transcribe audio without


547
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,216
internet connectivity and


548
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:52,376
without sending potentially


549
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:53,946
sensitive audio off device.


550
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:57,086
To adopt, you can check


551
00:17:57,086 --> 00:17:58,726
isAvailableForLocal Recognition


552
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:01,686
on Speech Recognizer and specify


553
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:03,846
requiresLocalRecognition when


554
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:05,336
creating a speech recognition


555
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:05,866
request.


556
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,876
Third, we have new ways for test


557
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:12,166
users to provide feedback in


558
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:12,616
TextFlight.


559
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,026
We understand as app developers


560
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:16,416
it's really important to


561
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,356
understand exactly where users


562
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:19,646
are running into issues in your


563
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:21,286
app, and we want to help you


564
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:22,936
learn from your test users while


565
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:23,926
preserving their privacy.


566
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:26,996
So in iOS 13, we're introducing


567
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:28,576
the ability for TextFlight users


568
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:30,626
to submit screen shots directly


569
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:31,976
from the Screenshot UI through


570
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:32,756
TextFlight.


571
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:35,416
They can also now send feedback


572
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:37,686
along with crash reports so you


573
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:39,396
can understand exactly what they


574
00:18:39,396 --> 00:18:40,546
were doing at the time of the


575
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:42,636
particular crash.


576
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:44,406
Testers are in control of


577
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:45,916
sharing data from their device,


578
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:48,126
and this is available in


579
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:51,226
TextFlight 2.3 on iOS 13 and you


580
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:52,496
can give feedback in App Store


581
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:52,756
Connect.


582
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:55,026
For more information, please


583
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:56,396
check out What's New in App


584
00:18:56,396 --> 00:19:00,386
Store Connect in the WWDC app.


585
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,446
Now, I'm going to turn it over


586
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:02,816
to my colleague, Julien, to talk


587
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:04,226
about privacy updates.


588
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:08,546
[ Applause ]


589
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:09,676
>> Thank you, Mark.


590
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:13,756
In this next section, let's talk


591
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:15,596
about privacy updates to


592
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:16,626
existing APIs.


593
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:19,956
We go through a series of five


594
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:22,086
updates in rapid fashion.


595
00:19:22,686 --> 00:19:25,916
First, CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo.


596
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:29,126
The CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo API


597
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:31,936
returns the name and Mac address


598
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:34,026
of the Wi-Fi access point a


599
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:35,996
device is currently connected


600
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:36,206
to.


601
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,176
This affects privacy as a Wi-Fi


602
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:42,616
access point reveals a user's


603
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:43,006
location.


604
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:48,056
Starting in iOS 13, CNCopy will


605
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:50,856
only work for certain categories


606
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,726
of apps, apps that declared the


607
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:57,196
CNCopy entitlement and apps that


608
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:00,006
configured a virtual private


609
00:20:00,056 --> 00:20:00,436
network.


610
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:03,536
Or apps that configured a Wi-Fi


611
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,516
network using the


612
00:20:04,516 --> 00:20:07,886
NEHotspotConfiguration API or


613
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:09,916
apps that obtain location


614
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,466
permission from the user.


615
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:14,016
What this means for you is that


616
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:15,876
you may not be able to access


617
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:17,266
CNCopy anymore.


618
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:20,036
You can find out more details


619
00:20:20,156 --> 00:20:21,526
about this in the networking


620
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:22,726
sessions listed below.


621
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,626
Second, contacts access.


622
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:30,376
Starting in iOS 13, apps that


623
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:32,216
have been authorized by a user


624
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:34,546
to access contacts will no


625
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:36,706
longer have access to the notes


626
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:37,916
field of a contact.


627
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:40,966
The notes field of a contact


628
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:43,316
potentially includes sensitive


629
00:20:43,316 --> 00:20:45,476
details such as sneaky comments


630
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,376
about your boss.


631
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:49,046
Most apps do not need access to


632
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:49,466
this data.


633
00:20:50,156 --> 00:20:52,096
If you believe you need access


634
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,816
to it, please file an


635
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:55,216
entitlement request at the


636
00:20:55,216 --> 00:20:56,306
following URL.


637
00:20:57,096 --> 00:21:00,086
Third, Custom URL Schemes.


638
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,156
Previously, if your app was


639
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:05,556
launched by a Custom URL Scheme,


640
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:08,356
you could identify the app that


641
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:10,586
launched you via an option of


642
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:11,586
open URL.


643
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:14,556
This revealed applications


644
00:21:14,646 --> 00:21:16,256
installed on a user's device.


645
00:21:17,106 --> 00:21:20,016
Starting in iOS 13, the source


646
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:22,466
application is only revealed to


647
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:24,276
apps from the same developer.


648
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:27,446
Fourth, Game Center.


649
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:30,336
In order to improve player


650
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,696
privacy, Game Center introduces


651
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:36,656
two new APIs.


652
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:38,606
The teamPlayerID for a


653
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:40,626
team-scoped player identifier


654
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:42,336
and the gamePlayerID for a


655
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:44,266
game-scoped player identifier.


656
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,146
The existing playerID identifier


657
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,606
is being deprecated.


658
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:51,836
This changes which identifier


659
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,516
you may use in your gaming app.


660
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:56,096
For more information, please


661
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,746
check out the Game Center video


662
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,726
in the WWDC app.


663
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:01,986
And five, contextual


664
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:02,956
information.


665
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:06,586
IOS doesn't know when your app


666
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:08,616
is most helpful to users.


667
00:22:09,656 --> 00:22:11,646
You can provide contextual


668
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:13,986
information, entry point into


669
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:17,546
your app via two main APIs,


670
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:19,966
NSUserActivity, to promote your


671
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:23,156
app in Search results, and


672
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:25,236
SiriKit INInteraction to promote


673
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:26,686
your app on on-device


674
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:28,456
intelligent scenarios such as


675
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:31,516
Maps Shortcuts and new this year


676
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,206
in the Share Sheet.


677
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:35,356
If you do promote your app, be a


678
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:35,916
good sport.


679
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:38,336
Delete content that was removed


680
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,826
from your app.


681
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:41,606
You don't want Siri Shortcuts to


682
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:43,336
make a suggestion to content


683
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:44,676
that does not exist anymore.


684
00:22:45,386 --> 00:22:47,246
Simply call the corresponding


685
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:49,516
deletion APIs.


686
00:22:49,516 --> 00:22:50,616
We just went through a series a


687
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:53,146
five privacy updates to existing


688
00:22:53,146 --> 00:22:53,426
APIs.


689
00:22:54,236 --> 00:22:56,436
In our next section, we take a


690
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:57,836
step back.


691
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:00,746
We discuss how a privacy


692
00:23:00,786 --> 00:23:03,476
challenge can be a chance to


693
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:04,066
innovate.


694
00:23:05,036 --> 00:23:07,226
Privacy is fundamental to the


695
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:08,766
design of every product.


696
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:11,126
At Apple, in the Privacy Team,


697
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,866
we work with engineers all


698
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:15,266
across Apple to build privacy


699
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:16,336
into our products.


700
00:23:17,926 --> 00:23:20,666
Once in a while, we hit a very


701
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,546
hard problem, a feature that we


702
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,406
really want to ship, but it's


703
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:27,276
not obvious how to protect


704
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:28,076
privacy.


705
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:31,676
So when that happens, we decide


706
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,836
to challenge ourselves.


707
00:23:33,236 --> 00:23:35,006
We aim to build a great feature


708
00:23:35,226 --> 00:23:36,756
without giving away user


709
00:23:36,756 --> 00:23:38,926
information, so we lean on our


710
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:41,646
privacy principles to find


711
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:43,406
solutions and innovate.


712
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:46,786
Today, we want to inspire you to


713
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:47,306
do the same.


714
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:49,686
Let's look at three critical


715
00:23:49,686 --> 00:23:51,346
areas of the user experience,


716
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:54,676
Machine Learning, Find My, and


717
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:54,896
Home.


718
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:57,366
Let's start with Machine


719
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:57,616
Learning.


720
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,196
There are many ways to build


721
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:01,726
Machine Learning applications.


722
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:04,656
Usually we need to train a model


723
00:24:05,096 --> 00:24:06,326
and then evaluate it.


724
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:09,006
So the first privacy challenge


725
00:24:09,246 --> 00:24:11,436
with Machine Learning is how to


726
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:13,536
train a machine learning model


727
00:24:14,216 --> 00:24:16,086
but without collecting sensitive


728
00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:18,886
user data while personalizing


729
00:24:18,886 --> 00:24:21,396
the model to every user and


730
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:24,066
significantly improving the user


731
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:24,516
experience.


732
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:27,106
And again, it usually starts


733
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:29,606
with data, and it's usually a


734
00:24:29,606 --> 00:24:30,616
lot of data.


735
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:33,326
And it can be challenging to


736
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:33,866
find data.


737
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:35,686
There are multiple options.


738
00:24:36,456 --> 00:24:38,556
The first option is to collect


739
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:39,426
data from users.


740
00:24:40,406 --> 00:24:42,686
So to protect user privacy, it's


741
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:44,796
important to apply best privacy


742
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:46,956
practices such as randomizing


743
00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:48,826
identifiers, rounding or


744
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:49,456
sampling.


745
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:53,466
But sometimes data is inherently


746
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:55,866
sensitive, like the picture of


747
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:56,626
user's face.


748
00:24:56,886 --> 00:24:59,286
A second option is to run a user


749
00:24:59,286 --> 00:24:59,656
study.


750
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:03,826
We invite select users to test


751
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:05,606
or feature in private and


752
00:25:05,606 --> 00:25:06,546
collect their data.


753
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:09,456
We did this ourselves to train


754
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:10,226
Face ID.


755
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:13,286
Finally, their external


756
00:25:13,286 --> 00:25:13,956
datasets.


757
00:25:14,786 --> 00:25:16,286
Some are publicly available for


758
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:17,246
research purposes.


759
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:19,416
Others require careful


760
00:25:19,446 --> 00:25:21,186
collaboration with other


761
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,766
companies and raise their own


762
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:24,896
privacy challenges.


763
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,696
Once you have data, you can


764
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:29,306
train a model.


765
00:25:30,316 --> 00:25:32,186
You can, for example, use Create


766
00:25:32,186 --> 00:25:32,306
ML.


767
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,416
A train model is great for most


768
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:37,926
users, but users are different,


769
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:39,976
each with their own needs.


770
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:43,166
What if you needed to tailor, to


771
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:45,546
personalize a model to specific


772
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:46,336
users?


773
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,086
This year, we introduce


774
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:51,316
updatable Core ML models.


775
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:53,876
Send your updatable model to the


776
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:54,236
device.


777
00:25:55,116 --> 00:25:57,316
An updatable model takes in


778
00:25:57,316 --> 00:25:59,126
training data from the user and


779
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:01,296
produces a new personalized


780
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:01,936
model.


781
00:26:02,826 --> 00:26:04,376
We do this ourselves with Face


782
00:26:04,406 --> 00:26:04,786
ID.


783
00:26:05,276 --> 00:26:07,436
Face ID automatically adjusts to


784
00:26:07,436 --> 00:26:08,006
your appearance.


785
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:10,906
If you grow a beard or grow


786
00:26:10,906 --> 00:26:13,146
longer hair, Face ID still


787
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:13,876
recognizes you.


788
00:26:14,026 --> 00:26:15,876
And this all happens on the


789
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:16,146
device.


790
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:19,976
Training uses resources though,


791
00:26:20,526 --> 00:26:22,656
and it may affect a user


792
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:24,056
experience.


793
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:25,366
While there's a new Background


794
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,606
Task API that allows you to


795
00:26:27,606 --> 00:26:29,536
schedule machine learning tasks


796
00:26:29,886 --> 00:26:32,406
in the background, we recommend


797
00:26:32,856 --> 00:26:34,746
scheduling a task within a week


798
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:35,096
or less.


799
00:26:36,356 --> 00:26:38,526
If you choose a date too far


800
00:26:38,526 --> 00:26:40,876
into the future, iOS may not


801
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,266
schedule it.


802
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:43,706
You can learn more about the


803
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:45,276
Background Task API in our


804
00:26:45,276 --> 00:26:45,906
session below.


805
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:50,126
But sometimes, we need more than


806
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:51,016
one user's data.


807
00:26:51,896 --> 00:26:54,026
We need data from many different


808
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:54,586
users.


809
00:26:55,576 --> 00:26:57,676
Today, I want to share with you


810
00:26:58,676 --> 00:27:00,296
a new technique that we are


811
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:00,876
developing.


812
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:03,726
This is an example of how we


813
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:06,386
innovate in privacy for machine


814
00:27:06,386 --> 00:27:06,626
learning.


815
00:27:07,656 --> 00:27:09,906
Federated Learning is a new


816
00:27:09,906 --> 00:27:11,236
approach that is picking up


817
00:27:11,236 --> 00:27:12,596
steam in the machine learning


818
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:13,096
community.


819
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:15,806
Today, we're introducing Private


820
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:18,136
Federated Learning by combining


821
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:19,816
Federated Learning with


822
00:27:19,816 --> 00:27:21,016
differential privacy.


823
00:27:21,736 --> 00:27:25,406
The idea is simple, instead of


824
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:27,826
collecting user data with


825
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:30,066
Private Federated Learning, we


826
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,986
collect model updates.


827
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:35,636
In other words, devices tell the


828
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:38,006
server how a machine learning


829
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:40,166
model should be updated.


830
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:42,786
Let's walk through an example.


831
00:27:43,726 --> 00:27:46,336
It all starts with the server


832
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:48,136
giving devices an original


833
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:48,556
model.


834
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:50,506
We show it in white here.


835
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:53,376
Each device trains the model


836
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:55,846
under local data and obtains a


837
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:56,326
new model.


838
00:27:57,436 --> 00:27:58,976
We show it here by changing the


839
00:27:58,976 --> 00:27:59,266
color.


840
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:00,986
They compute the difference


841
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:02,996
between this new model and the


842
00:28:02,996 --> 00:28:04,836
original one and send these


843
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:06,846
model updates back to Apple


844
00:28:06,846 --> 00:28:07,396
servers.


845
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:11,076
The server aggregates these


846
00:28:11,076 --> 00:28:13,046
model updates into a new


847
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:15,216
enhanced machine learning model


848
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:16,506
that we show here with a


849
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:17,336
gradient color.


850
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:20,826
Note that in this process no


851
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:23,276
user data is sent in plain, and


852
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:24,856
we have no needs for any user or


853
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:26,056
device identifiers.


854
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:28,976
The server then updates the


855
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,686
devices back with a new model,


856
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,386
and this cycle can go back and


857
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:35,256
forth between the devices and


858
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:35,656
the server.


859
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:38,646
From a privacy perspective, we


860
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:40,206
need to analyze whether those


861
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:42,686
model updates include sensitive


862
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:43,176
data.


863
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:46,056
It's often considered that model


864
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:46,986
updates are fine.


865
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:48,566
They're not plain user data.


866
00:28:49,576 --> 00:28:52,016
But unfortunately, in some


867
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:54,846
corner cases, a curious server


868
00:28:55,446 --> 00:28:57,866
could attempt to reconstruct the


869
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,806
user data from model updates.


870
00:29:00,526 --> 00:29:02,686
For example, here, if a user


871
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:04,766
sent model updates relative to


872
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:07,446
this castle, a curious server


873
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,926
may be able to reconstruct the


874
00:29:09,986 --> 00:29:11,776
castle image from the model


875
00:29:11,776 --> 00:29:12,046
update.


876
00:29:12,736 --> 00:29:15,136
So, to prevent this, we protect


877
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:18,236
model updates using on device


878
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:20,356
and on the server Separated


879
00:29:20,686 --> 00:29:23,026
Differential Privacy and Central


880
00:29:23,506 --> 00:29:24,766
Differential Privacy.


881
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:28,246
Differential Privacy adds noise


882
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:29,546
to the model updates.


883
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:32,186
This ensures that a curious


884
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:35,086
server cannot reconstruct the


885
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:35,676
image anymore.


886
00:29:36,496 --> 00:29:38,946
You can find more details about


887
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:40,586
how we use Separated


888
00:29:40,586 --> 00:29:42,016
Differential Privacy in the


889
00:29:42,086 --> 00:29:44,796
paper below that we wrote.


890
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:47,146
Private Federated Learning can


891
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:49,156
be used to improve on-device


892
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:49,966
intelligence.


893
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:52,246
This is not a research


894
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:52,796
experiment.


895
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,666
We are starting to use this


896
00:29:54,696 --> 00:29:56,596
technology in iOS 13 in a


897
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:58,706
variety of use cases including


898
00:29:58,706 --> 00:30:00,646
QuickType keyboard, personalized


899
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:02,126
Hey Siri, and more in the


900
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:02,496
future.


901
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,266
Once you train a model, you want


902
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:07,666
to use it.


903
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:10,606
This raises the second privacy


904
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:11,986
challenge with machine learning.


905
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:15,616
How to evaluate a model without


906
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:18,156
collecting user data in a fast


907
00:30:18,156 --> 00:30:20,166
way and without suffering from


908
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,406
Internet connection delays.


909
00:30:21,406 --> 00:30:24,546
The first way that comes to mind


910
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,576
is to simply send user data to


911
00:30:26,676 --> 00:30:28,166
the server, evaluate the model


912
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,376
there, and get back the


913
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,046
inference.


914
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:32,616
But this means sending more user


915
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:33,536
data to the server.


916
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:36,236
Instead, we prefer on-device


917
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:36,896
intelligence.


918
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:38,706
We send a model down to the


919
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:39,216
device.


920
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,286
The device evaluates it locally.


921
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:43,586
This has a lot of advantages.


922
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,376
It's less data sent to the


923
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:46,016
servers.


924
00:30:46,546 --> 00:30:47,966
It works even if you don't have


925
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:49,696
Internet, and it's fast if you


926
00:30:49,776 --> 00:30:51,186
use Core ML.


927
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:54,546
Core ML is optimized to run fast


928
00:30:54,826 --> 00:30:56,986
on iOS devices and others.


929
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,246
It's easy to convert your


930
00:30:59,246 --> 00:31:01,286
existing model to a Core ML


931
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:04,396
model, and this year, we expand


932
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:05,316
the number of model


933
00:31:05,316 --> 00:31:07,046
architectures that are


934
00:31:07,046 --> 00:31:07,686
supported.


935
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:09,886
You can learn more in the Core


936
00:31:09,886 --> 00:31:13,016
ML session listed below.


937
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:15,496
On-device intelligence provides


938
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:19,506
strong privacy advantages, and


939
00:31:19,506 --> 00:31:21,386
we like to communicate those


940
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:23,256
advantages to our users in the


941
00:31:23,376 --> 00:31:25,986
form of privacy assurances.


942
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:29,376
A privacy assurance is a simple


943
00:31:29,446 --> 00:31:31,696
privacy sentence that we share


944
00:31:31,936 --> 00:31:32,696
with our users.


945
00:31:33,336 --> 00:31:34,896
This is not a privacy policy


946
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:35,556
with legalese.


947
00:31:36,116 --> 00:31:38,596
For example, with Face ID, we


948
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,726
say, Face ID data never leaves


949
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:42,296
the device.


950
00:31:43,476 --> 00:31:44,816
This is a clear and strong


951
00:31:44,816 --> 00:31:47,066
statement about our approach to


952
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:48,526
privacy with Face ID.


953
00:31:48,926 --> 00:31:51,696
It's easy for all users to


954
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:53,036
understand.


955
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,916
All right, this was machine


956
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:55,246
learning.


957
00:31:56,396 --> 00:31:59,206
Let's talk about Find My next.


958
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:01,396
This year we announced a new


959
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:03,426
Find My application that merges


960
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:05,806
the Find My Friends and the Find


961
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:07,706
My iPhone apps.


962
00:32:07,796 --> 00:32:09,666
One feature that we were very


963
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,876
excited about is the offline


964
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:12,696
finding feature.


965
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:14,936
Here's a challenge that was


966
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:16,096
brought to our attention.


967
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:19,636
A user forgot their MacBook at


968
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:20,476
the public library.


969
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:24,176
The user realizes that, launches


970
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,036
the new Find My app and attempts


971
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:28,756
to find the MacBook, but it may


972
00:32:28,756 --> 00:32:30,726
not work because the MacBook is


973
00:32:30,726 --> 00:32:33,736
not connected to the Internet.


974
00:32:33,736 --> 00:32:35,186
So the privacy challenge is


975
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:38,356
support finding devices between


976
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:41,266
Mac and iPhone or a Watch that


977
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:43,316
is, even when it's not connected


978
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:44,656
to the Internet when it's


979
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,266
offline while protecting the


980
00:32:47,296 --> 00:32:50,256
privacy of the lost devices but


981
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:52,266
also of anyone that would help


982
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:54,166
you find those lost devices and


983
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,106
making sure that Apple doesn't


984
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:58,166
learn anything in the process.


985
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:01,036
And, of course, with limited


986
00:33:01,036 --> 00:33:02,066
impact on the battery life.


987
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:04,056
This was a long list of


988
00:33:04,056 --> 00:33:05,936
challenges, and so the idea for


989
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:07,336
us was to rely on crowd


990
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:07,846
sourcing.


991
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:10,846
We wanted to make it easy to


992
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:12,826
detect a lost MacBook via


993
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,746
Bluetooth and report its


994
00:33:14,746 --> 00:33:16,096
location to Apple servers.


995
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:18,706
But we couldn't rely on a static


996
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:20,126
identifier broadcast over


997
00:33:20,126 --> 00:33:20,536
Bluetooth.


998
00:33:21,226 --> 00:33:23,276
A static identifier could allow


999
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,856
anyone to track any device at


1000
00:33:25,856 --> 00:33:27,856
any time, and we couldn't do


1001
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:29,106
that.


1002
00:33:29,336 --> 00:33:32,426
Instead, the MacBook broadcasts


1003
00:33:32,756 --> 00:33:35,146
and ephemeral public encryption


1004
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:35,316
key.


1005
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:39,106
This key changes over time.


1006
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:43,036
Any nearby phone can receive


1007
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:44,646
over Bluetooth this encryption


1008
00:33:44,646 --> 00:33:46,796
key, compute their own location,


1009
00:33:47,056 --> 00:33:48,446
and encrypt it with the


1010
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:49,126
encryption key.


1011
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:52,116
Then, this encrypted data can be


1012
00:33:52,116 --> 00:33:53,626
submitted to Apple servers.


1013
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:56,766
Note here that since location is


1014
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:59,356
encrypted, Apple cannot see it.


1015
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:01,266
Also, note that no information


1016
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:02,506
is provided about the nearby


1017
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:04,036
phone that helped find the lost


1018
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:04,506
device.


1019
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:07,916
Finally, the owner can ask Apple


1020
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,716
later on for the corresponding


1021
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,996
encrypted data, decrypt it to


1022
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:14,085
obtain the location to its lost


1023
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:14,716
device.


1024
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:17,666
With this proposal, we can share


1025
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:19,806
the following privacy assurance


1026
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:20,766
with our users.


1027
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:24,565
Apple does not know the location


1028
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,775
of any offline devices or


1029
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:27,576
finders.


1030
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:29,706
This is a big result.


1031
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:31,706
We found a way to design a


1032
00:34:31,706 --> 00:34:34,186
fantastic feature with industry


1033
00:34:34,295 --> 00:34:35,446
leading privacy.


1034
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:41,156
Next, let's talk about the Home.


1035
00:34:42,315 --> 00:34:44,616
The Home is a safe place, and


1036
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:45,976
important place for all of us.


1037
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,416
It's a safe place we go to after


1038
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:50,085
work or after a long day at


1039
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:52,856
WWDC, and as the popularity of


1040
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,746
Smart homes increases, so does


1041
00:34:56,045 --> 00:34:57,836
new privacy threats emerge.


1042
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:00,846
Many customers have concerns


1043
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:02,526
about Smart home accessories,


1044
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:04,996
and nothing is more sensitive


1045
00:35:05,406 --> 00:35:07,456
than security cameras in the


1046
00:35:07,456 --> 00:35:07,656
home.


1047
00:35:08,786 --> 00:35:10,446
So the privacy challenge here is


1048
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:12,856
allowing users to view their


1049
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:15,356
security cameras from anywhere


1050
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:18,216
while allowing no one else to


1051
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,696
access the video feed, not even


1052
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:23,416
Apple, and still enabling Smart


1053
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,006
camera experiences.


1054
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:27,266
So we worked with camera


1055
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:29,206
providers on two main things.


1056
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:32,466
First, we rely on on-device


1057
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:34,366
intelligence to do computer


1058
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,636
vision in the home on the home


1059
00:35:36,856 --> 00:35:38,206
resident device.


1060
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,596
Be it a HomePod, an Apple TV, or


1061
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:44,576
an iPad, we detect people and


1062
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,736
objects directly in the home,


1063
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:48,296
not in the Cloud.


1064
00:35:49,456 --> 00:35:51,596
Second, we store camera


1065
00:35:51,596 --> 00:35:53,256
recordings in an end-to-end


1066
00:35:53,256 --> 00:35:54,046
encrypted manner.


1067
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,776
This means only you can see the


1068
00:35:57,816 --> 00:36:00,276
content from your camera, and we


1069
00:36:00,276 --> 00:36:01,626
can make the following privacy


1070
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,176
assurance.


1071
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:05,536
Only you can see the video from


1072
00:36:05,536 --> 00:36:06,236
your camera.


1073
00:36:07,056 --> 00:36:08,306
Short and sweet.


1074
00:36:09,206 --> 00:36:11,016
It's time to wrap up the privacy


1075
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:11,426
session.


1076
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:13,766
We talked about three privacy


1077
00:36:13,766 --> 00:36:15,626
challenges and showed you how we


1078
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:16,176
solved them.


1079
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:18,886
Throughout this presentation, we


1080
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:21,166
also talked about API updates


1081
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,456
and new features that we


1082
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:25,416
designed with privacy.


1083
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,146
Every year, every release, with


1084
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:30,776
every product we challenge


1085
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:32,786
ourselves to build great


1086
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:35,216
features without giving away


1087
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:36,216
user information.


1088
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:39,326
Because privacy is fundamental


1089
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:40,996
to the design of every product,


1090
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:44,296
we share privacy assurances with


1091
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:44,846
our users.


1092
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,376
Simple sentences about our


1093
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:50,626
commitment to protect user


1094
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,106
privacy.


1095
00:36:52,566 --> 00:36:54,186
There are three things we want


1096
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:55,626
you to remember today.


1097
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:59,316
First, among the first questions


1098
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:01,056
you should ask yourselves when


1099
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,996
working on a new project is how


1100
00:37:02,996 --> 00:37:05,086
you will protect user data.


1101
00:37:05,546 --> 00:37:08,546
Ask what you should do, not what


1102
00:37:08,546 --> 00:37:11,026
you can do with your app.


1103
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:13,996
Earn the trust of your users by


1104
00:37:13,996 --> 00:37:16,266
making it easy for them to know


1105
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:18,126
that their privacy is protected


1106
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:20,006
in your app.


1107
00:37:20,456 --> 00:37:22,846
Second, if you face a tough


1108
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,106
privacy problem, challenge


1109
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:26,776
yourself to find a solution.


1110
00:37:28,106 --> 00:37:30,766
Privacy is a chance to innovate.


1111
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:33,316
Find a way to deliver your


1112
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:36,106
feature without giving away more


1113
00:37:36,106 --> 00:37:36,666
user data.


1114
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,496
And third, privacy is an


1115
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:42,896
opportunity to engage with your


1116
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:43,436
users.


1117
00:37:44,936 --> 00:37:47,206
Privacy is about people.


1118
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:51,156
Don't let a privacy policy take


1119
00:37:51,156 --> 00:37:51,946
that away from you.


1120
00:37:52,656 --> 00:37:54,416
Share your privacy assurances


1121
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:55,706
with your users.


1122
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:58,246
If you have any more questions,


1123
00:37:58,536 --> 00:38:00,106
please join us in the privacy


1124
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:01,676
lab right after this talk.


1125
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:03,866
On behalf of the entire privacy


1126
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,546
team, thank you very much for


1127
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:06,226
joining us today.
