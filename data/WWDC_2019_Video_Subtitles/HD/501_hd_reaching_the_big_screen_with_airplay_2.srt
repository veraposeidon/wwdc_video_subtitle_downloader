00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:03,500
[ Music ]


2
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:09,426
>> All right.


3
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:10,826
Good morning, everyone.


4
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:14,496
My name is Jonathan Bennett and


5
00:00:14,496 --> 00:00:16,166
I work with the Connected Media


6
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:16,966
team at Apple.


7
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:19,416
And I'm happy to be here today


8
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,706
helping kick off the conference,


9
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:22,116
talking with you about AirPlay.


10
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,036
So to start, let's talk about


11
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:26,646
what you can do with AirPlay.


12
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:30,326
You can use AirPlay to


13
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:32,946
wirelessly send a video to watch


14
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:35,916
on your TV or listen to music


15
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:36,626
throughout your home.


16
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:41,086
And you can also share pretty


17
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:44,916
much anything from your iOS or


18
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,556
macOS screen using AirPlay


19
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,146
Mirroring.


20
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:49,766
And so for today's talk, we're


21
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:51,686
going to focus on video and


22
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:52,796
we'll go over some of the


23
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:55,756
enhancements we've made to make


24
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,106
sure that you can find out about


25
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:00,556
all the great TV destinations


26
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:03,556
and AirPlay experiences on


27
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,866
AirPlay sending devices.


28
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,136
So when it comes to


29
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,166
destinations, Apple TV used to


30
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,086
be the only way that you could


31
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:15,836
AirPlay a video to a TV, and


32
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:17,336
it's still a great choice for


33
00:01:17,336 --> 00:01:18,426
many people.


34
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:20,376
And as you heard earlier this


35
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:23,556
year, we've been working with


36
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,106
some of the largest TV


37
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:29,106
manufacturers to build AirPlay


38
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:31,856
support directly into the TVs.


39
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,956
This dramatically increases the


40
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:36,936
choices people have on where


41
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,396
they can AirPlay their video to,


42
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:41,126
and it adds a huge number of TVs


43
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:44,266
that you can now take advantage


44
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:44,466
of.


45
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:49,436
So just look for this label on


46
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:50,636
the box and you'll know that it


47
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:52,776
supports AirPlay Mirroring,


48
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:55,156
multi-room music and, of course,


49
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:55,576
video.


50
00:01:56,146 --> 00:02:00,836
And this is a high-quality video


51
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:06,156
experience with both Apple TV


52
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:08,156
and AirPlay capable TVs able to


53
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:11,426
support up to 4K HDR video with


54
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:12,236
a surround sound.


55
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:15,976
So those are some of the great


56
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:17,796
new additions that we've made to


57
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:17,886
TVs.


58
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:20,296
And when it comes to AirPlay


59
00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:22,726
sending devices, I'd like to go


60
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,656
over some of the enhancements


61
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,206
we've made to iOS to make it


62
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:26,456
easier than ever for people to


63
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:28,276
get the content they love from


64
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:31,806
your app to the TV.


65
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:34,426
So first, your video app can now


66
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:36,486
sort TV destinations to the top


67
00:02:36,486 --> 00:02:38,266
of the AirPlay list, making it


68
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:41,166
easier than ever to find the TV


69
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,266
you want to play a video on.


70
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,966
We've also made enhancements and


71
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,286
enriched the remote controls


72
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:50,976
available to allow people to


73
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:53,316
interact with your video quickly


74
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:53,996
and easily.


75
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:57,246
And we've also made improvements


76
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:58,076
to allow people to better


77
00:02:58,076 --> 00:02:59,816
multitask on their iOS devices


78
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:02,046
so they can receive a phone call


79
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:04,556
or check out that cute video


80
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:05,796
that they just got from an


81
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:07,786
iMessage while your video


82
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:09,066
continues playing on the TV.


83
00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:13,566
And lastly, iOS can now


84
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:16,076
intelligently suggest to TV to


85
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:17,666
AirPlay to using on-device


86
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,006
learning.


87
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:19,806
So I can just sit back on the


88
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:21,566
couch, launch your video app,


89
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,436
and just tap on my favorite show


90
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,256
and have it automatically show


91
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:25,906
on the TV.


92
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:30,266
With great new TV destinations


93
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:31,316
and all of these experience


94
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:32,786
improvements, now is the time to


95
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:34,346
make sure that your video apps


96
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:35,536
fully support AirPlay.


97
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:37,896
So I'd like to take the rest of


98
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:40,486
this talk to go over five key


99
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,296
areas that you can add this


100
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:44,246
great experience.


101
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:47,156
First, we'll make sure that you


102
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:48,376
have high-quality video


103
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:49,696
available for the TV.


104
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:52,816
Then we'll provide a way for


105
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,096
people to get that video onto


106
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:55,716
the TV using an in-app picker.


107
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:59,676
And once it's on the TV, we'll


108
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:00,606
make sure that people can


109
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:04,536
control it and we'll make sure


110
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,986
that that video keeps on playing


111
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:08,796
while they use their iOS device


112
00:04:08,796 --> 00:04:09,476
for other things.


113
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:13,256
And lastly, if you have an app


114
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:15,836
that plays primarily long-form


115
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:18,786
video like movies or TV, there


116
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:19,805
are some additional steps that


117
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:20,796
you should take to make sure


118
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:22,966
that your users benefit from


119
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:25,356
intelligent AirPlay Suggestions.


120
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:29,986
So let's start by talking about


121
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:31,256
high-quality video.


122
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:35,466
HTTP Live Streaming is a fast


123
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,666
and adaptive way to stream


124
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:37,916
high-quality video to any


125
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:38,506
device.


126
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:40,926
And you're likely already using


127
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:43,476
HLS to deliver video to your iOS


128
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:43,886
apps.


129
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,256
Now, some of you might be


130
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:48,286
curating your playlist to focus


131
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,536
on those type of devices.


132
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:52,096
So, an iPhone screen or an iPad


133
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:52,576
screen.


134
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:55,796
But remember at any time, a user


135
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,656
could take that video and want


136
00:04:57,656 --> 00:04:59,036
to send it and AirPlay it to a


137
00:04:59,036 --> 00:04:59,656
TV.


138
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:00,696
So it's important that you have


139
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:02,376
a full range of variants in your


140
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:04,876
playlist that are appropriate


141
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:07,036
for a TV, including variants


142
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:10,196
that support 4K, HDR and


143
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:10,946
surround sound.


144
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:14,266
Now, if in your playlist you


145
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,966
have multiple video codecs that


146
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:17,626
you use to encode your content,


147
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:19,766
be sure to also provide a full


148
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,276
range of variants for each video


149
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:21,696
codec.


150
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:23,506
This makes sure that your video


151
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:25,386
is fully supported on any device


152
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:27,646
it plays back on and it also


153
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:29,166
makes sure that the player can


154
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,876
transition smoothly between


155
00:05:31,876 --> 00:05:33,576
variants using the same video


156
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:34,406
codec.


157
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:37,856
Now, one thing that I find


158
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:40,536
myself doing frequently is fast


159
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:41,696
forwarding or seeking through


160
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:42,186
video.


161
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:46,656
And whether that's to skip a


162
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:48,676
scary part of a movie with--


163
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:49,986
that I'm watching with my kids


164
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:51,716
or to find that interesting


165
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:53,306
topic in the middle of a WWDC


166
00:05:53,306 --> 00:05:57,386
video having fast, rapid, frame


167
00:05:57,386 --> 00:05:59,716
previews while seeking allows me


168
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,886
to find what I want quickly and


169
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:02,476
confidently.


170
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,896
So you can add the support in


171
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,366
your videos by including an


172
00:06:06,426 --> 00:06:09,446
I-frame variant to your HLS


173
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:11,046
playlist.


174
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:13,946
And lastly, if you have


175
00:06:13,946 --> 00:06:15,426
high-value content that you need


176
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:16,566
to protect and manage, you're


177
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:18,196
likely using FairPlay Streaming


178
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:18,726
to do that.


179
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:21,106
And FairPlay Streaming is fully


180
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:22,866
supported whenever and wherever


181
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,626
you AirPlay, that includes


182
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:25,926
AirPlaying to an Apple TV.


183
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:28,296
And I'm also happy to say that


184
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:29,526
FairPlay Streaming is supported


185
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:31,506
on every smart TV with built-in


186
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:32,276
AirPlay support.


187
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:35,786
Now, there are more details


188
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,496
about validating your HL streams


189
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:38,706
for AirPlay than we can cover


190
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,336
here today, so we've made a


191
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:41,826
separate video associated with


192
00:06:41,826 --> 00:06:43,196
this session and I encourage you


193
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:46,206
to check that out.


194
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,826
So, having high-quality content


195
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,266
is great but we also want to


196
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:51,606
make sure that we have smooth


197
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:52,296
playback.


198
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:56,366
Now, if you have pre, mid or


199
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:57,846
post-roll content that you need


200
00:06:57,846 --> 00:07:00,686
to insert into your video, use


201
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,256
HLS's discontinuity tag to do


202
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:02,896
that.


203
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:05,126
This allows the player to remain


204
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:06,486
intact and the estimated


205
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:07,816
bandwidths to remain intact so


206
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,086
both your interstitial video


207
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:10,086
plays in high quality.


208
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:11,646
And when it ends and you resume


209
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:13,176
the main content, that content


210
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:15,196
can immediately begin in high


211
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:15,736
quality.


212
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:19,406
It's, again, important to make


213
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,536
sure that these interstitial


214
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:21,656
videos have the same video


215
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:23,366
formatting as the main content,


216
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:25,316
such as the same video codec and


217
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:26,556
this allows these transitions to


218
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:30,026
happen quickly and smoothly.


219
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,146
Now, if you can't use HLS


220
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:33,286
discontinuity tag for some


221
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,766
reason or you have multiple


222
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:36,056
pieces of content that you want


223
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,436
to play serially, we encourage


224
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:39,816
you to use AVQueuePlayer when


225
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:40,366
AirPlaying.


226
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:45,276
And if you can't use


227
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:47,286
AVQueuePlayer when AirPlaying,


228
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:49,166
please use the same AVPlayer


229
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,316
instance and just replace the


230
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:52,326
current item with your new


231
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:52,856
content.


232
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:55,286
You don't want to destroy an


233
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:56,756
AVPlayer and create a new one


234
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,976
for every piece of video or swap


235
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:01,026
between instances, because when


236
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:02,536
AirPlaying, the system doesn't


237
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:03,966
know that a new piece of video


238
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:04,916
is going to be arriving.


239
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:06,876
And so it might start tearing


240
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:07,976
down the engine and you don't


241
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:09,746
want to introduce this type of


242
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:10,846
delay just because you're


243
00:08:10,846 --> 00:08:12,346
transitioning between videos.


244
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:17,036
All right, we've got


245
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:18,296
high-quality content.


246
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:20,176
Now, let's give a way for people


247
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:21,426
to get that to the TV.


248
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,056
And you can do that by adding an


249
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:25,446
AirPlay picker into your app.


250
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,076
And new in iOS 13, you can


251
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:29,586
decide how you want to order


252
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:30,856
those destinations.


253
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:35,366
To add an AirPlay picker, use


254
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:36,385
AVRoutePickerView.


255
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:38,256
It's been available since iOS 11


256
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,836
and it's now available on macOS.


257
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:43,566
Now, some of you might be using


258
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:45,286
MPVolumeView's route button


259
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:47,176
properties to get a picker in


260
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:47,476
your app.


261
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,906
And in iOS 13, the route button


262
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,546
properties are now deprecated.


263
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:55,346
Now, don't worry, you can still


264
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:58,266
use MPVolumeView for putting


265
00:08:58,266 --> 00:08:59,796
volume UI into your app.


266
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,736
But when it comes to route


267
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:02,766
buttons, use RoutePickerView.


268
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:11,976
So let's see how you can add


269
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:13,816
that, and it's really simple.


270
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:16,566
All I have to do is create a


271
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:17,876
AVRoutePickerView and add it to


272
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:18,686
my view hierarchy.


273
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:23,236
And in iOS 13, I can set


274
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:25,166
prioritizesVideoDevices to true


275
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:28,996
and that will give me a route


276
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:31,516
button icon that is focused on


277
00:09:31,516 --> 00:09:33,176
video with the AirPlay video


278
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:36,056
logo, and it also sorts those TV


279
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,296
destinations to the top making


280
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:39,366
it super easy to find that TV I


281
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,756
want to play to.


282
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:46,536
So now that I have video playing


283
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:48,636
on the TV, let's make sure that


284
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:49,836
people have a way to control it


285
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:51,036
and this is really important.


286
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,166
And so we've made sure that


287
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,626
remote controls are more


288
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,426
convenient and capable than ever


289
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:56,526
throughout the system.


290
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:59,556
For example, I can control my


291
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:02,236
video with lock screen controls


292
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:03,426
and we've added additional


293
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:04,346
capabilities when you've


294
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:06,876
targeted a TV.


295
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:09,186
I can also use Siri and issue


296
00:10:09,186 --> 00:10:10,906
play commands and say, you know,


297
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:12,276
play this on my TV.


298
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,816
And it's not just about


299
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:20,746
controlling what's on your iOS


300
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,306
device but also the devices


301
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:22,886
around you.


302
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:24,576
For example, you can pull down


303
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:25,846
Control Center and you can


304
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:27,296
target HomePods that are playing


305
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:29,086
music throughout your home or


306
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,806
even a tvOS app that is playing


307
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:32,136
a video and I can see what's


308
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:33,606
playing and control it from


309
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:34,686
almost any device.


310
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:41,216
So, what happens if your app


311
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:42,896
doesn't support remote controls?


312
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:44,216
Well, here I have my app and


313
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:45,566
it's AirPlaying to the TV.


314
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:48,276
But if I were to lock the


315
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:49,826
screen, I wouldn't know that the


316
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:51,066
video is playing and, more


317
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:52,306
importantly, I would have no way


318
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:53,546
to interact with that video.


319
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:56,866
So by supporting remote


320
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:59,616
controls, you can know what's


321
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:02,816
playing, how far along I am in


322
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:05,476
that video, a great way to


323
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:07,646
interact with it quickly, and


324
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:09,336
then there's even a way to get


325
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,616
back to the app that's currently


326
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,096
playing that video by just


327
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:14,546
tapping the artwork or the


328
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:15,316
title.


329
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,246
So, let's go through how you can


330
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:19,416
add these remote controls in


331
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,836
your app and it starts with


332
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:24,076
becoming the Now Playing app.


333
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,716
You become the Now Playing app


334
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:27,306
by doing two things, one is to


335
00:11:27,306 --> 00:11:28,886
at least support one remote


336
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,736
control command and the other is


337
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:32,046
to initiate playback with


338
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:33,316
immediate configuration.


339
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:36,356
And on iOS, that means


340
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:38,056
activating your audio session


341
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:40,066
with a non-mixable category.


342
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:41,506
And for most video apps, that's


343
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:42,286
going to be the playback


344
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:42,856
category.


345
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:47,006
On macOS and iOS code running on


346
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,656
macOS, you'll do something


347
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:49,896
slightly different.


348
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:51,476
You're going to grab the


349
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:53,856
MPNowPlayingInfoCenter and


350
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:55,606
change the playback state


351
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:57,956
whenever you start or end your


352
00:11:57,956 --> 00:11:59,086
video experience.


353
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:03,286
When it comes to supporting


354
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:04,986
remote controls, if you're using


355
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:06,896
AVKit's AVPlayerViewController


356
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:08,096
to present your video, it


357
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:09,956
handles remote controls for you


358
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:11,706
so you're all set.


359
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:15,336
If you're using AVFoundation and


360
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:16,736
a custom UI to present your


361
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,766
video, you'll need to use


362
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:19,846
MPRemoteCommandCenter and


363
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:21,756
MPNowPlayingInfoCenter in order


364
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:23,146
to get equivalent functionality.


365
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:24,906
And so I'd like to spend some


366
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:26,296
time going through step by step


367
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:27,816
about how you use this media


368
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:30,256
player APIs and build out this


369
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:31,006
functionality.


370
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:34,416
So here I am back at my lonely


371
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,216
lock screen, and let's just add


372
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,156
some basic support by supporting


373
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:39,896
the play command.


374
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,856
I can do that by creating a


375
00:12:43,856 --> 00:12:45,396
setup method for supporting


376
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:46,286
remote controls.


377
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:48,166
And we'll be coming back to this


378
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,316
method again and again as we


379
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:50,196
continue to build out our


380
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:50,816
support.


381
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:54,256
I first grab the shared instance


382
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:55,256
of the remote command center.


383
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,596
And the remote command center


384
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:00,456
supports many different types of


385
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:01,516
media commands.


386
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:03,346
Here, we're supporting the play


387
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:03,826
command.


388
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:05,596
And to that, we'll add a target


389
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:07,606
handler to receive that command


390
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:08,686
and do something with it.


391
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:10,616
So here, we'll start our


392
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:10,936
playback.


393
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:14,096
And once I've done that, I'll


394
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,966
return a status on whether that


395
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:17,346
command succeeded or failed.


396
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,966
And this is the basic structure


397
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:20,976
you're going to use for any


398
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:22,276
remote command that you support.


399
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:25,936
So to flash out our playback


400
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:28,106
command handling, we'll support


401
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:29,446
the pause command and the


402
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:31,176
togglePlayPauseCommand by adding


403
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:32,216
handlers for those.


404
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:36,496
So this got me a platter with a


405
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:38,926
play/pause button and I at least


406
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:40,236
know what app is playing, but


407
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,916
it'd be really great to know


408
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:43,236
what video is playing.


409
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,656
And you can do that by providing


410
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:47,846
Now Playing info.


411
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:50,296
And Now Playing info comes in


412
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,266
two parts, one is the item


413
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,616
metadata such as the artwork or


414
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:56,896
title and then the playback


415
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:58,326
state such as the duration and


416
00:13:58,326 --> 00:13:59,926
the current elapsed time.


417
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:02,056
So in my code, there are two


418
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:03,706
major events where I'll want to


419
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:04,576
update this information.


420
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:07,486
One is when a item changes, so


421
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:09,336
going from episode one to


422
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:10,936
episode two.


423
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:14,016
The other is when I have a


424
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:15,736
current item and the playback


425
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:17,346
state changes so I-- my rate


426
00:14:17,346 --> 00:14:20,166
changes or I seek to a new


427
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,256
position in the video.


428
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:26,686
So when an item changes, I'm


429
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:28,466
going to take a metadata that


430
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,336
I've packaged up in my app with


431
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,906
a structure just to pass it


432
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:33,776
around through my app, I'm going


433
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:34,986
to update that static Now


434
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:36,686
Playing info such as the title


435
00:14:36,686 --> 00:14:37,366
and the artwork.


436
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:41,436
And if I have it, I'm going to


437
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:43,696
update the playback info at this


438
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:44,616
time as well.


439
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,056
Now, when a playback state


440
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:50,416
change happens, all I need to do


441
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,846
is update that playback info.


442
00:14:51,846 --> 00:14:54,496
I don't need to update artwork


443
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:56,446
and spend time doing all of


444
00:14:57,216 --> 00:14:57,326
that.


445
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:58,846
So let's see how you can update


446
00:14:58,846 --> 00:14:59,806
some of this information.


447
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,806
And the first thing I'm going to


448
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:04,296
do is grab the Now Playing info


449
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:06,496
dictionary from the shared info


450
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:06,956
center.


451
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:11,036
And to this dictionary, I'm


452
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,296
going to update my metadata.


453
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:13,866
So here, I'm updating title and


454
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:14,396
artwork.


455
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:16,016
And there are many other types


456
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,276
of metadata that are supported


457
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:18,576
and that I might support in my


458
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:18,826
app.


459
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,266
Regardless of what I support,


460
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:23,426
it's important to update this


461
00:15:23,426 --> 00:15:25,216
metadata or clear it out, nil it


462
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,206
out if a particular item doesn't


463
00:15:28,206 --> 00:15:29,826
have that type of property.


464
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:32,866
You don't want a mix of old and


465
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,206
new metadata in the dictionary.


466
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:38,606
Once I've updated it, though, I


467
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:39,996
just pass it back to the info


468
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:41,126
center for presentation.


469
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:46,816
So, it's really simple to update


470
00:15:47,106 --> 00:15:48,276
Now Playing information.


471
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:49,936
And now, let's see how we update


472
00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:50,896
the playback info.


473
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:53,496
And it's done very similarly.


474
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:54,836
I grab the Now Playing


475
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:56,466
information, the info


476
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,366
dictionary, and to that, I'm


477
00:15:58,366 --> 00:15:59,906
going to update the duration,


478
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:01,376
the elapse playback time, and


479
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:02,076
the playback rate.


480
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:05,846
And now, I only need to update


481
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:07,106
this on significant change


482
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:07,356
events.


483
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:08,326
I don't need to update this


484
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:10,006
every second to see progress


485
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:10,886
through the remote UIs.


486
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,906
As long as I update these three


487
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:15,216
items when a rate changes or I


488
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:16,776
have a significant jump, then


489
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,816
the system can infer where you


490
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:20,206
are in your video at any given


491
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:22,236
moment and update the remote UIs


492
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:22,816
accordingly.


493
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:25,836
And again, once I've updated


494
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:26,916
this, I'll just pass it back to


495
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,206
the info center to get


496
00:16:30,276 --> 00:16:30,586
presented.


497
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,686
So I know what video is playing


498
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:34,216
and it's really nice to be able


499
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:36,506
to navigate through that video.


500
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:39,096
So you can add the support for a


501
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,406
seeking with a playhead scrubber


502
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,206
or skipping forward and backward


503
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:45,386
in your video.


504
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:47,666
So let's see how we do this.


505
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:50,606
So we're back in our method for


506
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:51,786
setting up remote control


507
00:16:51,786 --> 00:16:52,326
commands.


508
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:55,046
And I'm going to add support for


509
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,186
the skip forward command.


510
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,386
And this is one of the commands


511
00:16:58,386 --> 00:16:59,206
that supports additional


512
00:16:59,206 --> 00:17:01,016
configuration, and here, I'm


513
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:02,026
setting the preferred skip


514
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:03,746
interval to 15 seconds.


515
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:07,576
I then add a handler for that


516
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:08,046
command.


517
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:10,796
And it's important to note here


518
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,646
that I'm using the interval


519
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:13,556
that's passed to me through the


520
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:14,396
commands event.


521
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:16,366
Just because I set a preferred


522
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:17,226
interval doesn't mean that's


523
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:18,455
going to be used every time.


524
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:20,816
For example, I could ask Siri to


525
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:23,036
jump forward by 42 seconds.


526
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:24,175
And that's the value that's


527
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:25,326
going to get passed to me and


528
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:26,356
the one that I should honor.


529
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:30,446
I'll then round out my support


530
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:32,576
by supporting the skip backward


531
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:34,576
command and the change playback


532
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:35,966
position command which is used


533
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:36,616
when seeking.


534
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:41,266
Now, for some apps and some


535
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:42,396
types of video, you might need


536
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:43,586
to temporarily disable


537
00:17:43,586 --> 00:17:45,636
navigation and you can easily do


538
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:47,076
that by setting the isEnabled


539
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:48,646
property on the commands that


540
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:49,526
you need to disable.


541
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:50,856
You don't need to remove the


542
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:55,286
target handler and add it back.


543
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,046
So one thing new this year that


544
00:17:58,046 --> 00:17:59,406
we've added to remote control


545
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:01,866
UIs is the ability to select and


546
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:03,496
change audio languages and


547
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:04,246
subtitles.


548
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:06,456
So if you have video with these


549
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:08,326
types of options, you're going


550
00:18:08,326 --> 00:18:09,316
to want to add this type of


551
00:18:09,316 --> 00:18:11,866
support for remote controlling.


552
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:14,746
This allows people to watch the


553
00:18:14,746 --> 00:18:19,636
video the way they want and need


554
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:20,236
easily.


555
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:22,766
So you can add this support by


556
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:25,096
providing a list of audible and


557
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:28,206
legible language options that


558
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:29,406
represent the audio languages


559
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:30,196
and subtitles.


560
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:32,366
And you can also then identify


561
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:33,376
the current selections in each


562
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:34,176
of those groups.


563
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:35,986
And lastly, you're going to want


564
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:37,316
to handle changes to those


565
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,156
selections via the remote UIs.


566
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:42,706
So let's see how we provide this


567
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,236
information.


568
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:46,396
And it starts by creating a


569
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:46,886
mapping.


570
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:49,466
So I'm going to load the audible


571
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:52,876
and legible language groups from


572
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:54,006
my AVAsset.


573
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:55,696
And I'm going to create a


574
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:57,906
mapping of these by translating


575
00:18:57,906 --> 00:18:59,406
them into the media player


576
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:02,466
objects that represent these


577
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:03,186
options.


578
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:04,296
And I can use convenience


579
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:05,196
functions to do that.


580
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:07,406
And I'll maintain this mapping


581
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:10,286
in my app so that when I receive


582
00:19:10,286 --> 00:19:11,466
a language option from a remote


583
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:12,476
command, I can eventually


584
00:19:12,476 --> 00:19:13,636
translate it into the


585
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:15,656
AVFoundation object and set it


586
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,446
on my AVPlayer item to change


587
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:18,166
the selection.


588
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:22,056
So once I have this mapping, I


589
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:23,246
can update that info.


590
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,626
And here, I'm doing that in the


591
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:26,886
update method for my playback


592
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:28,666
info, where I've already added


593
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,116
the playback duration and elapse


594
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:31,586
time.


595
00:19:32,536 --> 00:19:34,466
And to that, I'm going to add


596
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,186
the list of available option


597
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:38,876
groups and their current


598
00:19:38,876 --> 00:19:39,436
selections.


599
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:43,026
So now, we have to handle


600
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:44,696
changes to those selections.


601
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:48,456
And I can do that in my setup


602
00:19:48,456 --> 00:19:50,466
method for remote controls or


603
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:51,626
I'll add support for the


604
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:54,016
enableLanguageOptionCommand.


605
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:56,626
And this handler is going to


606
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,036
first get the current playback


607
00:19:58,036 --> 00:19:58,306
item.


608
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:01,406
And then use my mapping to take


609
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:02,226
the language option that I


610
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:05,186
received and translate it to the


611
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:06,376
AVFoundation objects.


612
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:10,646
I'll then use AVPlayer items,


613
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:12,886
select option and group method


614
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:16,256
to select the new option on the


615
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:16,896
current item.


616
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:19,166
And I'll want to update my Now


617
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,536
Playing info and other internal


618
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:22,216
state and handle that playback


619
00:20:22,216 --> 00:20:22,696
change.


620
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:27,126
Now, there are some types of


621
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,356
option groups that could have


622
00:20:28,356 --> 00:20:29,166
nothing selected.


623
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,426
For example, turning off


624
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:31,996
subtitles and closed captions.


625
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:33,416
And this comes through with the


626
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,176
disableLanguageOptionCommand.


627
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:35,956
So you want to make sure to


628
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:37,676
support both the enable and


629
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:38,796
disable commands.


630
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:41,036
And the handler is very similar,


631
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:43,216
first, getting the current item


632
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:46,326
and using my mapping to find the


633
00:20:46,326 --> 00:20:46,716
group.


634
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:49,856
But now, I'm going to check if


635
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:51,086
that group allows empty


636
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:53,016
selection and make sure that it


637
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:53,406
can.


638
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:57,676
And if it does, I'm going to use


639
00:20:57,676 --> 00:20:58,786
the same select method but


640
00:20:58,786 --> 00:21:00,226
passing nil as the option and


641
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,316
this will deselect all the


642
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:02,326
options in that group.


643
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:07,676
So I've got a full set of remote


644
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:09,296
controls that I can support.


645
00:21:09,456 --> 00:21:10,836
When do I register and


646
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:11,986
deregister for these?


647
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:13,766
For most video apps, you're


648
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,046
going to register when you have


649
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:16,746
content to play and that's when


650
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:19,886
a user selects a video in your


651
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:20,036
app.


652
00:21:21,136 --> 00:21:22,726
And you also want to deregister


653
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:23,916
when you have nothing to play.


654
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:27,116
So, a user exits your video.


655
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:29,146
And you'll use that opportunity


656
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:30,226
to also clear out the Now


657
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:31,506
Playing info dictionary to make


658
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:33,086
sure that there's no still data


659
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:33,796
hanging around.


660
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,986
Now, I mentioned that it's not


661
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:38,986
just about controlling what's


662
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:40,476
playing from your device but the


663
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:41,536
devices around you.


664
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:44,216
So if you have a tvOS app that


665
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:46,426
you make, try playing some


666
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:49,076
content on Apple TV and pulling


667
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,976
down Control Center on an iPhone


668
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:53,146
and target that Apple TV.


669
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:56,236
See that you're seeing the video


670
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:57,456
information that you expect and


671
00:21:57,456 --> 00:21:58,556
you're able to control it as you


672
00:21:58,556 --> 00:21:58,976
expect.


673
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,826
The same goes for using Siri to


674
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:01,646
control your TV.


675
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:07,006
So the examples that I went


676
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:08,656
through just now are all part of


677
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:09,816
a sample project that we've made


678
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:11,156
available associated with this


679
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:11,496
session.


680
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,656
And I encourage you to check


681
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:13,706
that out.


682
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:17,286
All right.


683
00:22:17,286 --> 00:22:18,626
We got high-quality content that


684
00:22:18,626 --> 00:22:19,856
we can get on the TV and we can


685
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:20,806
control it.


686
00:22:21,136 --> 00:22:22,376
When it's playing on the TV,


687
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:23,516
it's really nice to be able to


688
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,366
use my phone or my iPad for


689
00:22:25,366 --> 00:22:26,226
other things.


690
00:22:27,086 --> 00:22:29,166
And there are two parts to


691
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,736
supporting a great multitasking


692
00:22:30,736 --> 00:22:31,386
experience.


693
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:33,026
One is to make sure that your


694
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:35,256
video keeps on playing while the


695
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:36,366
user multitasks.


696
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:38,356
And the other is to make sure


697
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,526
that if there's already video


698
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,396
playing on the TV that your app


699
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:43,336
and navigating through its UI


700
00:22:43,336 --> 00:22:46,086
doesn't accidentally interrupt


701
00:22:46,186 --> 00:22:47,126
that experience.


702
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:51,556
So, when I'm watching a video on


703
00:22:51,556 --> 00:22:53,876
my phone, my video app is


704
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:54,506
usually staying in the


705
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,006
foreground because I need to


706
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:57,226
look at it on the screen.


707
00:22:57,936 --> 00:23:00,896
But when I'm AirPlaying on the


708
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:02,746
TV, I'm now free to use my


709
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:04,236
iPhone for other things like


710
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:06,066
check my messages or mail, or


711
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:06,766
social media.


712
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,506
If I'm using a video app that


713
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:13,406
doesn't support background


714
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:16,346
media, the video is going to


715
00:23:16,346 --> 00:23:17,526
stop the moment I leave that


716
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:17,806
app.


717
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:19,686
And so we want to make sure that


718
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,516
your video can continue playing.


719
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:24,306
And you can do this by


720
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:26,166
supporting the audio background


721
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,836
mode in your app's Info.plist.


722
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:30,946
And you'll also configure your


723
00:23:30,946 --> 00:23:32,456
AVAudioSession for background


724
00:23:32,456 --> 00:23:32,966
playback.


725
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,556
For most video apps, that means


726
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:36,906
using the playback category.


727
00:23:37,106 --> 00:23:38,776
And this provides media


728
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:41,386
appropriate behaviors in your


729
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,696
app, including playing in the


730
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:46,416
background.


731
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,786
Another thing about the playback


732
00:23:47,786 --> 00:23:48,786
category devices, it'll


733
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:49,866
interrupt the other media.


734
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,496
So it's really important to make


735
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,286
sure that you only activate your


736
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:54,656
audio session when a user


737
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:56,596
presses play and begins playback


738
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:58,816
on a primary piece of content in


739
00:23:58,816 --> 00:24:00,676
your app.


740
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:02,496
Now, once you go active, you can


741
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:04,126
stay active.


742
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:06,976
There's no need to deactivate


743
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:08,256
your audio session just because


744
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:12,826
the user paused the video.


745
00:24:13,226 --> 00:24:14,696
Now, media interruptions can


746
00:24:14,696 --> 00:24:16,666
happen at any time.


747
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:18,916
And so, it's important to listen


748
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,346
to those notifications on


749
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:21,156
AVAudioSession.


750
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:23,746
And when an interruption begins,


751
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:25,466
you update your UI and internal


752
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:26,056
state.


753
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:28,426
And when it ends, check the


754
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,456
notifications payload and make


755
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:32,736
sure that you check the


756
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:35,566
shouldResume key and honor that


757
00:24:35,566 --> 00:24:36,086
value.


758
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:38,486
So, only automatically resume


759
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:40,386
your video if it returns true.


760
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:43,776
When you have video already


761
00:24:43,826 --> 00:24:45,046
playing on the TV, it's


762
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:46,986
important to test your app and


763
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,386
launching it, navigating to the


764
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,976
UI and make sure that there's


765
00:24:49,976 --> 00:24:51,156
nothing that accidentally


766
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,606
AirPlays that you didn't expect,


767
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:54,796
or that it interrupts that


768
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:56,146
current video experience.


769
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:59,566
And I like to go over a couple


770
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,106
examples that you might run


771
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:01,796
into.


772
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,896
For one, there's sometimes video


773
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:05,926
that should never AirPlay.


774
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:09,396
So if I have an animation on app


775
00:25:09,396 --> 00:25:11,406
launch that I achieved using a


776
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:14,986
video asset, you don't want that


777
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:16,056
interrupting the current


778
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:16,906
experience.


779
00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:18,886
The same goes if I have video


780
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:20,326
assets I use for other types of


781
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:22,236
visual flourish or to promote


782
00:25:22,236 --> 00:25:24,176
content within my app.


783
00:25:24,526 --> 00:25:25,976
You can make sure that those


784
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:26,916
videos don't interrupt the


785
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:27,946
current experience and stay


786
00:25:27,946 --> 00:25:31,386
local on the device by setting


787
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:33,456
allowsExternalPlayback to false.


788
00:25:33,986 --> 00:25:37,276
Your app should only AirPlay a


789
00:25:37,276 --> 00:25:38,896
video when a user has directly


790
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:40,416
interacted with that video.


791
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:46,326
And to that end, you should not


792
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:48,746
auto-play primary content just


793
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:50,156
because your app launched or


794
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:51,266
came into the foreground.


795
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:54,856
When it comes to media, people


796
00:25:54,856 --> 00:25:56,376
should always be in control of


797
00:25:56,376 --> 00:25:57,606
when playback begins.


798
00:25:58,866 --> 00:25:59,846
And this is really important,


799
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:01,006
and I want to go over a couple


800
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:02,486
examples of why.


801
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:06,136
So here, I am listening to music


802
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:08,176
on my iPhone and I have a video


803
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:10,126
app that supports on-demand


804
00:26:10,126 --> 00:26:11,766
video that I can watch but also


805
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:13,666
auto-plays a live TV channel


806
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:15,226
when the app comes to the


807
00:26:15,226 --> 00:26:15,856
foreground.


808
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:18,566
So if I'm listening to music, I


809
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:20,346
launch that app, that music is


810
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,956
going to stop and I had no


811
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,426
control over it.


812
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,566
And I might have launched that


813
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:27,136
app for a purpose other than


814
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:28,366
watching that live video.


815
00:26:28,996 --> 00:26:32,076
You want to make sure that


816
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:33,686
people can launch your app


817
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:36,106
confidently knowing that their


818
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:37,286
current experience won't get


819
00:26:37,286 --> 00:26:37,956
interrupted.


820
00:26:38,526 --> 00:26:41,046
And I like to call out one more


821
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:42,306
important example that is new


822
00:26:42,306 --> 00:26:42,846
this year.


823
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:47,106
For long-form video apps, iOS


824
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,956
can suggest a TV to


825
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:52,416
automatically play to when the


826
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:53,316
video begins.


827
00:26:53,816 --> 00:26:55,326
And when this happens, the


828
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:56,996
system provides a notification


829
00:26:56,996 --> 00:26:59,006
telling the user that the video


830
00:26:59,006 --> 00:27:00,096
will automatically play on the


831
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:00,596
TV.


832
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:02,726
And people can tap that


833
00:27:02,726 --> 00:27:04,406
notification or the status bar


834
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:05,966
icon to change that suggested


835
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:06,746
destination.


836
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:10,876
Now, if I have an app that


837
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:13,626
auto-plays its content, it's


838
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:15,116
possible that that video starts


839
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:16,786
playing on the TV before I've


840
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:18,256
had a chance to really see and


841
00:27:18,256 --> 00:27:20,106
interact with that notification.


842
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:22,446
By requiring to use the action


843
00:27:22,446 --> 00:27:24,896
to begin playback, you can


844
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:26,726
provide people the power to


845
00:27:26,726 --> 00:27:28,756
decide both when and where they


846
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:30,376
play their video, and that


847
00:27:30,376 --> 00:27:31,386
creates a great media


848
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:32,166
experience.


849
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,316
And so, to talk with you more


850
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:37,116
about long-form video apps and


851
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:38,596
their integration with


852
00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:39,946
intelligent AirPlay Suggestions,


853
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:41,496
I'd like to invite up on to the


854
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:42,746
stage Marty Pye.


855
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:49,606
[ Applause ]


856
00:27:50,106 --> 00:27:52,496
>> Thank you, Jonathan.


857
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:53,446
Hello, everyone.


858
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:54,416
My name is Marty Pye.


859
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:55,916
I'm an AVKit engineer here at


860
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:56,196
Apple.


861
00:27:56,816 --> 00:27:58,526
And I'm here today to tell you a


862
00:27:58,526 --> 00:27:59,356
little bit more about the


863
00:27:59,356 --> 00:28:00,536
advanced routing features we


864
00:28:00,536 --> 00:28:03,246
built into iOS 13 and how your


865
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:04,416
long-form video apps can take


866
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,606
advantage of these features.


867
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:08,376
So first, we'll talk about what


868
00:28:08,376 --> 00:28:10,086
a long-form video app actually


869
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:10,296
is.


870
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,666
Then I'll talk a bit more about


871
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,396
what these specific routing


872
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:15,606
behaviors are that we've built


873
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:16,476
for long-form video apps.


874
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:18,456
And finally, I'll show you how


875
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:20,416
to integrate these features into


876
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:20,906
your code.


877
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,746
So what is a long-form video


878
00:28:25,356 --> 00:28:25,436
app?


879
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,106
As the name suggests, any app


880
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:28,626
that primarily plays long-form


881
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:30,306
video content is considered a


882
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,226
long-form video app.


883
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:32,826
This content includes things


884
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:35,456
such as movies or the TV type


885
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:37,806
content like TV shows, sports,


886
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:38,566
et cetera.


887
00:28:38,936 --> 00:28:41,206
If your app primarily plays


888
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,036
content from social media or


889
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:45,446
other types of short news clips,


890
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,256
then it would not qualify as


891
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:48,036
long-form video.


892
00:28:48,596 --> 00:28:51,876
We encourage you to assess your


893
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:53,456
app holistically to decide in


894
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:54,996
which category of movie it


895
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:55,466
belongs.


896
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,916
So once you've decided that your


897
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,956
app is long-form video, how will


898
00:28:59,956 --> 00:29:01,136
the AirPlay routing behavior


899
00:29:01,136 --> 00:29:02,486
differ for such apps?


900
00:29:03,456 --> 00:29:05,106
Let's take a look at an example.


901
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:09,076
If-- Imagine you're watching a


902
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:11,006
documentary on banana slugs and


903
00:29:11,006 --> 00:29:12,666
you're AirPlaying this content


904
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:14,346
from your iPhone to an Apple TV.


905
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,096
New in iOS 13, when your friend


906
00:29:18,096 --> 00:29:20,276
sends you his latest sweet dirt


907
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:22,026
biking video, you can go ahead


908
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,456
and watch this short content


909
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:25,366
locally on your device without


910
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:26,896
interrupting the banana slug


911
00:29:26,896 --> 00:29:28,466
documentary that's playing on


912
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:31,216
the TV.


913
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:32,596
Another feature we've built into


914
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:35,036
iOS 13 is AirPlay Suggestions.


915
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:38,066
If the user goes to play some


916
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:39,806
content and the AirPlay routing


917
00:29:39,806 --> 00:29:42,186
system detects a nearby likely


918
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:44,816
AirPlay device, then the system


919
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,266
may prompt the user and suggest


920
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:48,886
to AirPlay to this device.


921
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:50,726
Or, depending on the confidence,


922
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:52,016
the system might also


923
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:53,756
automatically route playback to


924
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:54,436
that device.


925
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:57,006
So now that you know about these


926
00:29:57,006 --> 00:29:58,856
features, how to take advantage


927
00:29:58,856 --> 00:29:59,976
of them in your app?


928
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:01,986
Well, there's two things you


929
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:02,526
need to do.


930
00:30:02,696 --> 00:30:04,206
And the first thing is


931
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:05,496
registering your app as a


932
00:30:05,496 --> 00:30:06,616
long-form video app.


933
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,596
So how do we do this?


934
00:30:09,456 --> 00:30:10,566
It's really very simple.


935
00:30:11,536 --> 00:30:12,876
All you need to do is add the


936
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:14,836
AVInitialRouteSharingPolicy key


937
00:30:14,836 --> 00:30:16,796
to your app's Info.plist and set


938
00:30:16,796 --> 00:30:17,956
it to a long-form video.


939
00:30:19,256 --> 00:30:21,046
By setting this on the plist, we


940
00:30:21,046 --> 00:30:22,496
can ensure that your app behaves


941
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:24,146
like every other long-form video


942
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:25,846
app on the system before you


943
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:27,176
create any of your playback


944
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:28,876
objects and the moment it gets


945
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:29,366
launched.


946
00:30:33,056 --> 00:30:34,756
Now, the second thing you need


947
00:30:34,756 --> 00:30:36,936
to do in order to leverage the


948
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,656
AirPlay Suggestions is prepare


949
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:39,916
the routing system prior to


950
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:40,486
playback.


951
00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:43,016
I'm first going to give you a


952
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:44,576
little conceptual overview of


953
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,326
how that works, and then we'll


954
00:30:46,326 --> 00:30:48,726
dive into how to achieve it in


955
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:51,606
code.


956
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:53,416
So in your app, you most likely


957
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:54,666
have some sort of browsing UI


958
00:30:54,996 --> 00:30:57,016
where users can scroll through


959
00:30:57,016 --> 00:30:58,266
different pieces of content,


960
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:00,246
select the piece of content they


961
00:31:00,246 --> 00:31:01,646
would like to play, and hit


962
00:31:01,646 --> 00:31:01,876
Play.


963
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,256
Well, it's at this transition


964
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:06,316
from browsing to actual playback


965
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:07,996
where you should prepare the


966
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:09,156
AirPlay routing system.


967
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:11,316
And what happens when you


968
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:12,436
prepare the routing system?


969
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:15,756
Well, it may decide to


970
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:17,556
automatically play the content


971
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,996
locally on the device or route


972
00:31:19,996 --> 00:31:21,926
it to an external screen, be it


973
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:23,876
via a likely nearby AirPlay


974
00:31:23,876 --> 00:31:25,446
device, or if you have an


975
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:28,046
external screen wired into the


976
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:29,236
device.


977
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:30,646
However, depending on the level


978
00:31:30,646 --> 00:31:32,256
of confidence, the system may


979
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:34,246
also prompt the user asking


980
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:36,506
whether they would like to play


981
00:31:36,506 --> 00:31:38,006
to a nearby AirPlay device.


982
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:41,086
And then depending on the user's


983
00:31:41,086 --> 00:31:42,416
choice, control will then be


984
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:43,826
handed back to your app with


985
00:31:43,826 --> 00:31:45,196
information about where the


986
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,916
content is going to play.


987
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:50,156
So let's take a look at how to


988
00:31:50,156 --> 00:31:51,026
do this in code.


989
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:55,036
When the user decides to hit


990
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:56,696
Play, you should call


991
00:31:56,696 --> 00:31:58,546
prepareRouteSelectionForPlayback


992
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:00,016
on the AVAudioSession.


993
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:01,866
And this method takes a


994
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:02,706
completion handler.


995
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:05,286
Now, this completion handler


996
00:32:05,286 --> 00:32:06,836
will be called right away if the


997
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:08,146
AirPlay can-- if the AirPlay


998
00:32:08,146 --> 00:32:09,596
routing system can make an


999
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:10,646
automatic decision.


1000
00:32:11,636 --> 00:32:13,796
However, there may also be a


1001
00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:15,566
prompt shown asking the user


1002
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:17,286
whether they would like to play


1003
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:18,756
to this nearby AirPlay device.


1004
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:20,776
If the user decides they would


1005
00:32:20,776 --> 00:32:22,416
like to play the content


1006
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,756
locally, then your completion


1007
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:26,296
handler will be called with


1008
00:32:26,296 --> 00:32:27,796
route selection type local.


1009
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:30,656
Now, you can go ahead and


1010
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:31,676
present your playback UI.


1011
00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:32,936
For example,


1012
00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:35,226
AVPlayerViewController, or you


1013
00:32:35,226 --> 00:32:36,736
can present your own custom


1014
00:32:36,736 --> 00:32:37,276
playback UI.


1015
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:40,736
If the user instead decides they


1016
00:32:40,736 --> 00:32:41,696
would like to AirPlay the


1017
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,456
content and they select the


1018
00:32:43,456 --> 00:32:45,106
living room, then your


1019
00:32:45,106 --> 00:32:46,026
completion handler will be


1020
00:32:46,026 --> 00:32:47,656
called with route selection type


1021
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:48,256
external.


1022
00:32:49,506 --> 00:32:50,786
And here, you have the


1023
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:52,536
opportunity to present some sort


1024
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:54,826
of custom remote playback UI


1025
00:32:55,146 --> 00:32:57,596
with controls dedicated to


1026
00:32:57,596 --> 00:32:58,706
controlling something that's


1027
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:00,216
playing on an external screen.


1028
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:02,176
Lastly, don't forget to handle


1029
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:03,566
the case that the user decides


1030
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:05,386
to cancel playback.


1031
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:08,246
Now, in order to test your app


1032
00:33:08,246 --> 00:33:09,826
and how it behaves in the


1033
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:12,316
various different scenarios with


1034
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:14,116
AirPlay Suggestions, we've built


1035
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,786
some toggles into the developer


1036
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:16,256
settings.


1037
00:33:17,016 --> 00:33:18,736
If you drill down to settings


1038
00:33:18,736 --> 00:33:20,396
developer, you'll find this new


1039
00:33:20,396 --> 00:33:21,846
entry, AirPlay Suggestions.


1040
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:25,426
And in here, you have the choice


1041
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:26,716
of three distinct modes.


1042
00:33:28,236 --> 00:33:30,096
The Default mode is just the


1043
00:33:30,096 --> 00:33:31,376
default system behavior.


1044
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,616
You can also select between a


1045
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,926
mode where the system will


1046
00:33:36,926 --> 00:33:38,556
always prompt the user and ask


1047
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:41,246
whether a content should AirPlay


1048
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:42,476
to a specific device.


1049
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:44,716
Or you can force the system into


1050
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:46,086
a mode where it will always


1051
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:47,936
automatically route to a


1052
00:33:47,936 --> 00:33:48,756
specific device.


1053
00:33:49,386 --> 00:33:50,946
And you can select which device


1054
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,456
this applies to in the nearby


1055
00:33:53,456 --> 00:33:55,406
list of routes below.


1056
00:33:56,056 --> 00:33:57,716
Once you've forced the system


1057
00:33:57,716 --> 00:33:59,756
into a specific mode, make sure


1058
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:00,866
that you reset the media


1059
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:01,436
services.


1060
00:34:02,956 --> 00:34:04,166
If you're concerned about


1061
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,026
whether AirPlay Suggestions will


1062
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:07,806
handle every possible use case


1063
00:34:07,806 --> 00:34:08,906
where your users might want to


1064
00:34:08,906 --> 00:34:11,016
AirPlay, then don't worry.


1065
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:13,136
At the end of the day, you're


1066
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:15,085
still fully in control when and


1067
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:16,786
where things will AirPlay.


1068
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:20,356
You can always select to change


1069
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:21,886
which device you're AirPlaying


1070
00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:23,886
to via AVRoutePickerView inside


1071
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:26,106
of your app via the controls


1072
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,676
inside of AVPlayerViewController


1073
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:29,386
or via control center.


1074
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:32,536
These new features just make it


1075
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:34,835
even easier for your users to


1076
00:34:35,216 --> 00:34:36,795
get your content onto the device


1077
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:37,556
of their choosing.


1078
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:39,706
We encourage you to check out


1079
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:41,755
the associated sample code where


1080
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:43,456
we demonstrate in a simple test


1081
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,235
app how to integrate the


1082
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:46,835
behaviors we've described today.


1083
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:49,036
So what have we learned today?


1084
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:51,206
We've learned how to integrate


1085
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:52,396
an AirPlay picker into our app


1086
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:53,936
via AVRoutePickerView.


1087
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:57,036
We've learned how to handle and


1088
00:34:57,226 --> 00:34:58,656
register for remote controls


1089
00:34:58,656 --> 00:34:59,526
commands via


1090
00:34:59,526 --> 00:35:01,576
MPRemoteCommandCenter, and how


1091
00:35:01,576 --> 00:35:03,606
to populate system UI with


1092
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:04,416
relevant Now Playing


1093
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:05,016
information.


1094
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:07,706
We've learned how to take


1095
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:08,576
advantage of AirPlay


1096
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:10,636
multitasking and how to register


1097
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:11,936
your app as a long-form video


1098
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:12,846
app.


1099
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:15,546
And lastly, we've learned how to


1100
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,056
prepare the routing system prior


1101
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:18,556
to playback in order to fully


1102
00:35:18,556 --> 00:35:19,956
leverage AirPlay Suggestions.


1103
00:35:21,196 --> 00:35:23,246
With that, I would like to thank


1104
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,406
you all for joining us on


1105
00:35:24,406 --> 00:35:25,516
today's session.


1106
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:28,136
We can't wait to see these new


1107
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:29,876
AirPlay features integrated into


1108
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:30,466
your apps.


1109
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,046
Enjoy the rest of the


1110
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:32,616
conference.


1111
