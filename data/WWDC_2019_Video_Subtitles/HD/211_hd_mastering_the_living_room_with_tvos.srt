00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:13,556
>> Good day.


4
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:18,066
Welcome. Over the past year, my


5
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:20,246
team and I have been reimagining


6
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:22,826
the Apple TV experience.


7
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:25,986
We've been testing ideas and


8
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:28,456
exploring ways to bring the fun


9
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,336
back into browsing.


10
00:00:32,176 --> 00:00:33,916
Today, we're going to share with


11
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,496
you our approach to mastering


12
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:38,606
the living room and connecting


13
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:41,666
people more thoughtfully to the


14
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,686
content they love.


15
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:47,336
My name is Tommy Payne.


16
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:48,866
My friends call me T.


17
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:50,996
Payne, and I'm a designer here


18
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:51,436
at Apple.


19
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:55,196
Growing up in Australia, the


20
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:57,496
rest of the world felt very far


21
00:00:57,496 --> 00:00:59,496
away, and I was searching for


22
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:00,446
ways to connect.


23
00:01:00,446 --> 00:01:02,426
I was interested and curious


24
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:03,686
about other cultures, other


25
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:05,346
people, different areas and


26
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:06,136
environments.


27
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:12,456
So I looked to TV and movies to


28
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:14,006
bridge that connection.


29
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,406
And I would come home from


30
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:18,736
school, plunk down on the couch,


31
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:19,906
and turn on the tele.


32
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:22,056
And I would start to channel


33
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:25,936
surf, flicking up and down until


34
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:27,496
something caught my attention.


35
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:29,306
And when it did, I was


36
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:30,186
captivated.


37
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:31,866
I was engrossed.


38
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,066
I was drawn into that story.


39
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:40,866
Picture in your mind a film or


40
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:42,896
TV show that you connected with.


41
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:46,336
Think about how it made you feel


42
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:50,496
and how time and space melted


43
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:53,566
away when it's just you living


44
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:55,656
that drama.


45
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:58,676
Now, hold on to that feeling as


46
00:01:58,676 --> 00:01:59,346
we continue.


47
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:01,186
I'm not going to be talking


48
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:02,616
about code, but my friends will


49
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:03,066
get to that.


50
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:06,176
I'm going to talk about the joy


51
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:07,896
of discovery.


52
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:11,926
How do we get people into what


53
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:14,446
they want to watch quicker and


54
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:16,546
remove barriers to entry?


55
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:20,566
The current state of TV, well,


56
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:22,316
it's kind of tedious.


57
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:24,436
You're presented with rows and


58
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,286
rows and rows of content to


59
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:27,366
scroll through.


60
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:31,186
Who here has spent five minutes,


61
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:34,556
10 minutes, 20 minutes just


62
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:36,476
searching for something to


63
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:36,936
watch?


64
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:40,076
It's a common and frustrating


65
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:40,566
experience.


66
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:45,276
And in that, we've become


67
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:47,786
paralyzed by choice and robbed


68
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:48,716
by indecision.


69
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:53,626
So, that's the problem.


70
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:55,966
Now, let's talk about the


71
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:56,486
solution.


72
00:02:58,876 --> 00:03:01,816
Apple TV has purposefully


73
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,896
migrated its designs towards a


74
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:07,666
content first experience.


75
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:10,006
And all that really means is


76
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:11,266
something's on, something's


77
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:11,956
playing.


78
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,266
When you launch into the


79
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:15,546
application, it's alive.


80
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:20,156
So, I'm going to break down for


81
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:22,576
you how to achieve a content


82
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:24,646
first experience with some best


83
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,426
practices, and I'm going to use


84
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:28,346
examples from the redesign of


85
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:30,616
Top Shelf and a couple from our


86
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:31,906
own TV app.


87
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:37,986
First of all, we want to remove


88
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:40,426
barriers to entry, get rid of


89
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:42,746
any hurdles between the content


90
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:43,456
and the viewer.


91
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:47,066
This principle is why Top Shelf


92
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:49,376
has become interactive and


93
00:03:49,836 --> 00:03:50,826
immersive.


94
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:52,876
Let's take a look.


95
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,506
So we launch into Apple TV and


96
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,255
we hold on a poster image for


97
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:18,656
five seconds.


98
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:21,946
After which, a trailer comes in.


99
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:25,796
And it's important to note here


100
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:27,666
that that trailer, we don't


101
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,396
force sound on the viewer in


102
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:30,366
this instance.


103
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:32,816
Too much sound and video when


104
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:34,186
you first launch into something,


105
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:35,656
it can be destructive.


106
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:39,156
However, we do allow people to


107
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:40,756
invoke the audio later on in the


108
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:41,306
experience.


109
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:45,836
So, the content is taking up all


110
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:46,396
the pixels.


111
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:48,406
It's filling the screen.


112
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:53,996
Next, we want to ensure that


113
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:55,686
because people are now watching


114
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,266
something that they can easily


115
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:57,886
interact.


116
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:01,296
Every swipe or click on the


117
00:05:01,296 --> 00:05:03,156
remote, it adds to somebody's


118
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:04,026
cognitive load.


119
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:06,436
So we want to reduce the number


120
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,176
of steps it takes for them to


121
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:09,906
achieve their task.


122
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:15,506
In Top Shelf, we use a visual


123
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:17,846
hint in the upper part of the


124
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:20,456
screen, and this tells people


125
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:22,406
swipe up to enter into full


126
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:22,996
screen mode.


127
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:24,896
Let's take a look at that in


128
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:25,376
action.


129
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:27,976
The user will place their thumb


130
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:30,326
on the remote and swipe up, at


131
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:33,876
which point the dock flies away


132
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:36,146
and you're left with just the


133
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:38,616
trailer playing in all its glory


134
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:39,916
filling the screen.


135
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:43,226
So you're still actually in a


136
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:45,766
browse mode but it feels like


137
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:47,076
playback, it feels like you're


138
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:48,716
inside the movie which is really


139
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:49,036
cool.


140
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:53,096
Anywhere that we can streamline


141
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:55,506
interactions, that's a good


142
00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:56,686
thing for our viewers.


143
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,406
So we've borrowed this


144
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:00,376
interaction from inside of TV


145
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:02,536
app where we use it to invoke


146
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,446
and hide menus in the playback


147
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:05,086
experience.


148
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:07,636
So by leveraging that knowledge


149
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:09,036
that already exists in the


150
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,176
viewer's mind, we're making it


151
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,296
easier because they don't have


152
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:13,906
to learn something from scratch


153
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:15,726
in this new context.


154
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,276
So now that people are


155
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:21,746
interacting, you want the app


156
00:06:22,656 --> 00:06:24,626
and the experience to feel


157
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:25,246
responsive.


158
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:27,686
Speed and pacing are essential


159
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:29,836
ingredients for minimizing


160
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:31,226
cognitive load.


161
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,636
Try and remove latency and lag


162
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,056
anywhere you can in your app.


163
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,636
That way, it will feel dynamic,


164
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:38,996
it will feel fluid.


165
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:43,736
We also want to avoid


166
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,576
overstimulating people.


167
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,356
Closet, chaotic, and distracting


168
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:51,186
interfaces, well, they derail


169
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:53,616
somebody from their task.


170
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,546
Imagine if you will you're


171
00:06:55,546 --> 00:06:59,416
standing in a room and 11 people


172
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,296
are talking to you loudly all at


173
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:01,596
once.


174
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,516
You can't hear what any one


175
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:05,486
person is saying.


176
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:15,106
If TV app interfaces do this as


177
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:17,886
well, people can't focus.


178
00:07:18,836 --> 00:07:20,956
By using too many animations,


179
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,806
icons, images and text styles,


180
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:25,526
it competes for somebody's


181
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:26,046
attention.


182
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:28,736
And we don't want somebody be--


183
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,286
to be in that competitive


184
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:30,886
mindset.


185
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:33,466
We want them to be focused and


186
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:34,666
relaxed.


187
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:39,916
Now, that we've made them in


188
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,826
this kind of relaxed state, we


189
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:44,036
can think about diversifying the


190
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,466
types of content in our UI.


191
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:48,586
And just means playing with


192
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:50,196
shapes and aspect ratios,


193
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:51,716
breaking the grid from time to


194
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:52,066
time.


195
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:55,436
In our own TV app, we've done


196
00:07:55,436 --> 00:07:57,766
this by interspersing a


197
00:07:57,966 --> 00:08:00,126
different kind of module in


198
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:02,446
amongst the standard 16 by 9


199
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:03,676
rows.


200
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:04,706
Now, this allows us to do a


201
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:05,386
couple of things.


202
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:08,356
First, it gives us, the


203
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:10,846
provider, a place to highlight


204
00:08:10,846 --> 00:08:12,336
something that's of great


205
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:14,466
importance, something that is


206
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,506
really meaningful that we want


207
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:17,226
you to notice.


208
00:08:17,786 --> 00:08:20,806
And for the viewer, it allows


209
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:23,556
their eye a moment of pause.


210
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,776
As they're scanning through


211
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:28,046
these dense grids, creating


212
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:30,206
something like this gives them a


213
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:31,586
time to breathe.


214
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:37,806
We want to reduce the canvas to


215
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:40,166
simple noncompeting elements.


216
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,576
And this means we create a


217
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:43,256
hierarchy.


218
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:47,626
In the Top Shelf design, the


219
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,866
content is of highest priority,


220
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:51,766
so it fills the screen.


221
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:54,556
Then we have the app dock and a


222
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:56,116
picking row below that in the


223
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:57,666
lower third, and they're of


224
00:08:57,726 --> 00:08:59,246
slightly less importance.


225
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:01,376
And by prioritizing elements,


226
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,616
you help people to navigate.


227
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:08,686
You help people by leading them


228
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:10,286
through the experience.


229
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:16,916
Now, meta-data, it's useful but


230
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,836
secondary in the content first


231
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,706
experience of Top Shelf.


232
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:23,886
Because initially we want to get


233
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:25,576
people excited about what


234
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:27,526
they're watching, and then we


235
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,626
signal that there's more info


236
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:31,406
available.


237
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:33,706
Let's take a look.


238
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,376
So the person was inside the


239
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:00,576
full screen experience of Top


240
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:02,516
Shelf, and they've rested their


241
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:04,226
thumb on the remote or clicked


242
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:07,686
and that invoked the meta-data.


243
00:10:08,046 --> 00:10:09,766
By giving control to the viewer


244
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:12,336
over the how and when to access


245
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:14,266
this extra information, the path


246
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:16,236
to pressing play and watching


247
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:17,766
the whole film becomes


248
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:18,616
simplified.


249
00:10:19,156 --> 00:10:22,026
And what's more, meta-data can


250
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:23,906
help someone change their mind


251
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:26,236
from being in a browse mode to


252
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:28,286
perhaps purchase, or from


253
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:29,906
browsing to subscribe.


254
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:34,906
Now pagination dots, they


255
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:36,806
communicate that you're viewing


256
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:38,896
one item in a set.


257
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:43,356
They also indicate the duration


258
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,926
of the browsing experience.


259
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:48,566
In our design, they're kept


260
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,206
small at the lower part of the


261
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:51,786
screen and they kind of look


262
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:52,626
like bread crumbs.


263
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:55,246
And we've used Apple TV system


264
00:10:55,246 --> 00:10:57,546
materials to ensure that they


265
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:59,506
contrast from any imagery that


266
00:10:59,506 --> 00:11:00,606
they sit on top of.


267
00:11:01,156 --> 00:11:02,346
We think they make great


268
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:04,606
additions to your applications


269
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,416
as well.


270
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:09,956
Chevrons indicate swipe


271
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:12,176
directions, up, down, left,


272
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:14,916
right, but they do something


273
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:16,176
else.


274
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:19,346
They hint at content just off


275
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:20,106
screen.


276
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:23,696
Together with pagination dots,


277
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,806
they help give somebody a sense


278
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:28,576
of place and ground them in the


279
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:28,986
UI.


280
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,676
And these little pieces of UI,


281
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:34,256
they're important tools, because


282
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:36,286
they help people avoid having to


283
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:37,906
trip and stumble asking


284
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,586
questions, like is this


285
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:41,686
clickable, how do I navigate out


286
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:43,726
of here, and, can I get back to


287
00:11:44,546 --> 00:11:45,356
this later?


288
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:47,446
All these kinds of questions


289
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:49,976
risk ruining somebody's


290
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:50,696
experience.


291
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:56,026
So with the redesigned Top


292
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:58,446
Shelf, we've enhanced the best


293
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,706
parts of browsing.


294
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:04,276
We used edge-to-edge content,


295
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:05,776
taking up the full real estate


296
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:07,506
available to us.


297
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:09,766
We have familiar navigational


298
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:12,456
queues, helpful meta-data and


299
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:14,006
simple gestures.


300
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:19,596
But the best part about it is


301
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:22,236
that it feels familiar.


302
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,836
It feels like when I was a kid


303
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:25,846
channel surfing.


304
00:12:26,436 --> 00:12:29,406
I'm able to go back and forth


305
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:31,776
until something captivates me.


306
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:40,276
So if you can use a few of these


307
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,916
techniques and principles in


308
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,536
your own designs, it will make


309
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:46,276
for wonderfully thoughtful


310
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:47,206
applications.


311
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:53,036
At Apple, we believe in the


312
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:56,326
power of content first.


313
00:12:57,496 --> 00:13:00,246
It's what's best for the viewer.


314
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:03,996
And collectively as we design


315
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:06,086
this vehicle that delivers great


316
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,616
content, that can have huge


317
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:13,646
impact.


318
00:13:14,116 --> 00:13:17,966
After all, TV, it has unique


319
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:18,816
abilities.


320
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,246
It has the ability to alter our


321
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:23,746
perspective.


322
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:27,936
It has the ability to transport


323
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:29,916
us to a different world.


324
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:34,506
And it has the ability to open


325
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:36,946
our eyes to big ideas.


326
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:42,556
And that's the goal, isn't it?


327
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:45,426
To connect people to stories


328
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:47,296
that change them.


329
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,576
So our job as developers or


330
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,196
designers, it's not to make


331
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:53,986
people wait in frustration, no,


332
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:56,476
it's to throw open the doors,


333
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:58,956
let them in, and let the content


334
00:13:59,256 --> 00:13:59,986
shine.


335
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:05,176
Because if we can do that, then


336
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:07,886
people are more likely to stay


337
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:11,856
and browse, watch something else


338
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:14,206
and enjoy it.


339
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:20,116
And that, that will lead to a


340
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:23,396
lasting emotional connection to


341
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,606
your product.


342
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:28,956
Next up, Caleb will talk to you


343
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:30,936
about how to take advantage of


344
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,726
the content first experience in


345
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:34,126
your own applications.


346
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:35,236
Caleb.


347
00:14:36,516 --> 00:14:42,136
[ Applause ]


348
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:43,166
>> Thanks, Tommy.


349
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:45,556
My name is Caleb.


350
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:47,096
I'm a software engineer on the


351
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,026
Apple TV team.


352
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:50,666
Today, I'm really excited to


353
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,826
share with you some great


354
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:53,856
enhancements we've made to Top


355
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:56,026
Shelf in tvOS 13.


356
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:02,066
Top Shelf is the first thing a


357
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:03,486
person sees when they wake up an


358
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,086
Apple TV.


359
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:06,866
It gives them an easy way to


360
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,706
browse content from your apps


361
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:11,896
and offers a simple interaction


362
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:13,176
where they can jump directly


363
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:14,196
into playback.


364
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:19,806
This year, we wanted to update


365
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:21,806
Top Shelf to take full advantage


366
00:15:22,116 --> 00:15:24,796
of the biggest screen in your


367
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:27,316
house, and provide that


368
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:28,826
captivating browse experience


369
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,336
that Tommy mentioned earlier.


370
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:33,096
I'm happy to share with you that


371
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:34,696
this year in tvOS 13, we're


372
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:37,256
doing that with the Carousel.


373
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:42,436
The Carousel had two important


374
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:43,946
features to Top Shelf.


375
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:46,336
First, it's immersive.


376
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:48,926
Full screen image and video


377
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:51,116
content from your apps plays


378
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:52,276
right on the home screen of


379
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:52,856
Apple TV.


380
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:56,796
When you swipe up to enter full


381
00:15:56,796 --> 00:15:58,666
screen mode, our UI gets out of


382
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,756
the way, so you can lean back


383
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,716
and see what's on.


384
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:07,116
The Carousel is also


385
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:07,786
interactive.


386
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:10,546
Swiping between apps and between


387
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:12,656
items feels like channel


388
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:13,166
surfing.


389
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:17,316
When you select an item, you can


390
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,676
see this rich meta-data you see


391
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:19,266
here at the bottom of the


392
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:19,686
screen.


393
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:22,156
We think this is the great way


394
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:23,426
for you to showcase the awesome


395
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:24,806
content you have inside your


396
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:27,436
apps right on the home screen of


397
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:28,036
Apple TV.


398
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:32,736
Now, I know that not all content


399
00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:35,486
is the same and one UI style may


400
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:36,876
not work equally well for


401
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:37,366
everyone.


402
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:40,946
So we have two styles available


403
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,606
for you in our API.


404
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:47,056
First is the Actions Carousel.


405
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,266
The Actions Carousel focuses


406
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:54,746
primarily on that full screen


407
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,106
image of video content provided


408
00:16:56,106 --> 00:16:58,136
by your apps, and offers only a


409
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:00,316
small number of UI elements for


410
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:01,156
you to customize.


411
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:04,356
Starting in the top-left corner,


412
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:07,156
we have the title and context


413
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:07,455
title.


414
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,435
These tell someone viewing your


415
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:11,976
Top Shelf content what they're


416
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:13,906
looking and why you're showing


417
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:14,356
it to them.


418
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:17,465
You can think of the context


419
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:18,636
title like you would a section


420
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:18,996
header.


421
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:21,066
It adds a logical grouping


422
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,165
between items in your Top Shelf.


423
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:28,156
And next we have the Play and


424
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:29,236
More Info buttons.


425
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:31,476
These buttons gives someone


426
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:33,066
viewing your content an explicit


427
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:35,066
way to jump directly to this


428
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:38,086
item inside your application and


429
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:40,346
either start playback right away


430
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:42,966
or learn more about it.


431
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:46,626
The second style we have for you


432
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:48,846
is called the Details Carousel.


433
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:53,616
And it looks like this.


434
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:54,796
You'll see some familiar UI


435
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:57,286
elements, top-left corner, our


436
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,376
title and context title, in the


437
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,606
bottom-left are the Play and


438
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:01,546
More Info buttons.


439
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:03,856
But our API also allows you to


440
00:18:03,856 --> 00:18:05,486
provide this rich meta-data you


441
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:06,396
see highlighted here.


442
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:10,426
Fields like summary, genre,


443
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:14,626
duration, or even a rich set of


444
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,206
media options to tell someone


445
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:17,716
what the content will look like


446
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:18,946
when they play it back on their


447
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:19,556
TV.


448
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:23,626
It does support 4K HDR or maybe


449
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:24,766
more importantly for someone


450
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:25,796
who's hearing impaired, this


451
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:27,376
does support close captions or


452
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:28,396
audio descriptions.


453
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:32,856
And on the far right, we have a


454
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:34,346
list of named attributes.


455
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:36,726
This is key value data that your


456
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:38,226
application has full control


457
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:38,626
over.


458
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:41,396
In this example, we have a list


459
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:42,936
of featured actors in the


460
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:44,506
Starring section and the


461
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:46,296
director of the movie in the


462
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:47,266
Director section.


463
00:18:48,146 --> 00:18:49,146
And it's really important to


464
00:18:49,146 --> 00:18:50,606
remember that when you populate


465
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:53,246
these fields, you localize and


466
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:54,806
pluralize them for the amount of


467
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:56,146
content you intend to display.


468
00:18:56,786 --> 00:19:00,076
So that's the new Carousel.


469
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,616
And when you adopt it, we have


470
00:19:03,616 --> 00:19:05,206
some best practices we like you


471
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:06,626
to keep in mind.


472
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:10,726
The Carousel is best used for


473
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:11,816
content discovery.


474
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:13,826
Some good examples of that might


475
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:16,586
be a featured movie, a new


476
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:18,706
season of a TV show, or


477
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:20,646
personalized recommendations for


478
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:21,596
the signed in user.


479
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:26,606
It should also be updated


480
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:27,276
regularly.


481
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:28,956
This is an opportunity for you


482
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:30,736
to showcase content in the Top


483
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,216
Shelf to draw someone into your


484
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:33,976
application.


485
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:36,896
So it needs to be fresh and feel


486
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:37,906
alive.


487
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:42,456
And like Tommy said, we don't


488
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:43,526
want to overwhelm the user with


489
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:44,276
too much choice.


490
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:46,706
Too many items in the Top Shelf


491
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,166
just adds noise and clutter.


492
00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:49,716
So we think a good number to


493
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:50,756
keep in mind is somewhere


494
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:55,376
between 5 and 10.


495
00:19:55,586 --> 00:19:56,936
Next, images.


496
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,796
Like I said, content in the Top


497
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:01,616
Shelf Carousel is full screen.


498
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:04,336
So your images should be 1920 by


499
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,126
1080 points and they should draw


500
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:09,666
in the entire frame of that


501
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:11,386
content.


502
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:13,066
And our API allows you to


503
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,156
specify images in both 1x


504
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:17,856
resolution for 1080p devices and


505
00:20:17,956 --> 00:20:20,146
2x resolution for 4K devices.


506
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:22,906
This is a great way for you to


507
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:24,726
help us optimize your content


508
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,096
for the best user experience in


509
00:20:27,096 --> 00:20:27,736
Top Shelf.


510
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:31,996
And now, safe areas.


511
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:34,446
The standard application safe


512
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:36,406
area on tvOS looks like this.


513
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:39,196
You have 90 points of padding on


514
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,176
the leading and trailing edges


515
00:20:40,176 --> 00:20:42,176
of your screen and 60 points of


516
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:44,146
padding on the top and bottom


517
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:44,586
edges.


518
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:46,586
And remember, it's OK for your


519
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:48,086
content to go outside that Safe


520
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:50,456
Area, but based on the device or


521
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:52,506
TV settings, the user may not be


522
00:20:52,506 --> 00:20:53,986
able to see it or interact with


523
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:54,166
it.


524
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:57,396
We have a similar safe area for


525
00:20:57,396 --> 00:20:58,076
the Carousel.


526
00:20:58,076 --> 00:21:00,326
When you put your images in the


527
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,726
Carousel, remember that they


528
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:03,836
might show under system UI like


529
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:06,426
the chevrons, the details UI in


530
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:08,606
the bottom or even the app grid.


531
00:21:09,356 --> 00:21:10,556
So, if you have things like


532
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:12,586
title art in your images, make


533
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:13,536
sure they don't conflict with


534
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:14,856
that system UI and make it hard


535
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,826
to see or use.


536
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:20,826
And last, videos.


537
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:23,656
Like Tommy showed, you can play


538
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:25,286
videos, trailers for your


539
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:27,346
content in Top Shelf Carousel.


540
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:30,156
Those video should be 1080p high


541
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:30,816
definition.


542
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:34,466
And if possible, you should


543
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:36,776
deliver them to us using HTTP


544
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:38,666
Live Streaming or HLS.


545
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,296
This is another way for you to


546
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:43,166
help us optimize your content


547
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,756
for the best user experience in


548
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:45,276
Top Shelf.


549
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,166
Those videos should be fast to


550
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,866
load and we should be able to


551
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:50,286
optimize them for the users'


552
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:51,246
available bandwidth.


553
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:56,266
And like I mentioned earlier,


554
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,456
the Carousel is a great place


555
00:21:57,456 --> 00:21:59,206
for you to preview your content.


556
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:01,056
We don't want you offering a


557
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:02,816
full-length viewing experience


558
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:03,966
in the Carousel.


559
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:07,156
So we think an appropriate


560
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:08,666
amount of time for your videos


561
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,236
is around 2 to 5 minutes.


562
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:14,296
And we encourage you to include


563
00:22:14,296 --> 00:22:15,966
audio in your videos.


564
00:22:16,076 --> 00:22:17,536
We will make sure the audio only


565
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,376
plays at the appropriate time.


566
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:21,966
That means on explicit user


567
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:22,426
action.


568
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:27,926
So now, we have four UI styles


569
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:30,166
available for you in Top Shelf,


570
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:32,986
starting with Carousel Actions,


571
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:38,166
the Details Carousel, and


572
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:41,886
Sectioned, and Inset Content.


573
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:45,466
And remember if your content


574
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:47,356
doesn't work in the Carousel, if


575
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:49,096
you don't have full screen art


576
00:22:49,096 --> 00:22:50,946
or video, that's OK.


577
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,016
We still encourage you to use


578
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:54,306
the Sectioned and Inset Content


579
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,576
styles to provide that


580
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:57,486
lightweight, easy to browse


581
00:22:57,766 --> 00:22:59,716
content experience in a Top


582
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:00,546
Shelf.


583
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,006
So that's an overview of the UI


584
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:05,746
and a little bit about how it


585
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:06,086
works.


586
00:23:07,046 --> 00:23:08,396
Now, let's talk about how you


587
00:23:08,396 --> 00:23:09,026
build one of these.


588
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:11,586
You'll do that with a Top Shelf


589
00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:12,246
Extension.


590
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:14,566
This year, we have an all new


591
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:16,246
extension and API that makes


592
00:23:16,246 --> 00:23:18,716
adopting Top Shelf easier than


593
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:19,566
ever.


594
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:22,416
You'll start by adding a new Top


595
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,186
Shelf Extension target to your


596
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:25,986
application in Xcode.


597
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:28,756
And that will grant you access


598
00:23:28,886 --> 00:23:31,056
to the Carousel as well as our


599
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:31,626
new API.


600
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:34,376
So now I'm going go over in


601
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:36,136
three major parts briefly,


602
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:38,866
starting at the top with


603
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:40,616
TVTopShelfContentProvider.


604
00:23:41,636 --> 00:23:43,156
This is the root object of your


605
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:45,096
extension and responsible for


606
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:46,486
responding to system requests


607
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:47,396
for Top Shelf data.


608
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:50,776
Our new API makes fetching your


609
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:51,786
content and responding


610
00:23:51,786 --> 00:23:54,296
asynchronously really easy.


611
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:58,396
Next is TVTopShelfContent.


612
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:00,796
This is a protocol you won't


613
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:01,766
really interact with much


614
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:02,316
directly.


615
00:24:02,796 --> 00:24:03,986
We provide three concrete


616
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,796
classes for you, one for each of


617
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:07,256
the three major UI styles,


618
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:10,936
Carousel, Sectioned, and Inset.


619
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:13,516
And each of these classes has


620
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:15,506
properties that are distinct for


621
00:24:15,506 --> 00:24:16,506
each UI style.


622
00:24:17,076 --> 00:24:19,536
And last, we have


623
00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:20,686
TVTopShelfItem.


624
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:23,406
Similar to the content classes,


625
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,826
we have different classes for


626
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:26,246
each content style that have


627
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:28,326
varying properties for each UI


628
00:24:28,326 --> 00:24:28,706
style.


629
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:32,186
Carousel, Item Collection, and


630
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:33,196
Sectioned Item for showing


631
00:24:33,196 --> 00:24:35,546
Sectioned Content, and Content


632
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:36,846
Item has enough properties to


633
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:38,106
show Inset Content.


634
00:24:38,606 --> 00:24:41,056
So now instead of going into any


635
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:42,726
more code, I think it's more fun


636
00:24:42,726 --> 00:24:44,116
if we do a demo and see how this


637
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:44,566
all works.


638
00:24:44,736 --> 00:24:45,586
So I invite my colleague,


639
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,846
Felipe, to the stage and help me


640
00:24:48,646 --> 00:24:48,726
out.


641
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:49,316
Felipe?


642
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:54,500
[ Applause ]


643
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,116
So like I said the first step


644
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:02,466
would be to add a new Top Shelf


645
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:03,976
Extension target to our project


646
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:04,636
in Xcode.


647
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:06,646
So we'll start by adding a new


648
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:07,036
target.


649
00:25:08,036 --> 00:25:09,576
And on the tvOS tab, we'll


650
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,846
select TV Top Shelf Extension.


651
00:25:12,286 --> 00:25:16,266
We'll give it a name and make


652
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,586
sure the Embed in Application


653
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:18,896
pop-up is set to the correct


654
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:19,236
value.


655
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:22,296
In this case we already have an


656
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:23,296
extension in our project with


657
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:24,566
some supporting files, so we'll


658
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,496
skip this for now and go right


659
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:27,426
to our ContentProvider.


660
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:30,726
This is what it will look like


661
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:31,746
when you add a new Top Shelf


662
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:32,846
Extension to your project.


663
00:25:33,996 --> 00:25:35,466
In the ContentProvider class,


664
00:25:35,556 --> 00:25:36,346
the subclasses,


665
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:38,696
TVTopShelfContentProvider and


666
00:25:38,696 --> 00:25:40,516
implements loadTopShelfContent,


667
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:42,036
it takes the completionHandler.


668
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:44,566
Right now we're calling that


669
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:45,886
with nil, which just means we


670
00:25:45,886 --> 00:25:46,906
don't have anything to display


671
00:25:46,906 --> 00:25:47,476
at the moment.


672
00:25:47,476 --> 00:25:48,836
So, let's replace that with some


673
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:49,406
real content.


674
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:56,326
Here, we're fetching a list of


675
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:57,606
featured movies from


676
00:25:57,606 --> 00:25:59,506
MoviesClient, and it responds


677
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:01,426
asynchronously with a result of


678
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:03,846
either a movies response or an


679
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:04,126
error.


680
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:05,766
So let's fill out each of those


681
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:07,206
cases with some real content


682
00:26:07,286 --> 00:26:08,356
starting with success.


683
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:10,676
Here, we'll call


684
00:26:10,676 --> 00:26:11,766
completionHandler with a real


685
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:12,436
model object.


686
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,136
And in the case of an error, we


687
00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:15,766
still want to call the


688
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:17,106
completionHandler with nil to


689
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:18,236
tell the system we don't have


690
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:19,896
any more work to do right now.


691
00:26:21,036 --> 00:26:23,216
Great. Let's go add some


692
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:24,486
extensions to our models that


693
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:26,086
let us fill out that rich Top


694
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:26,706
Shelf content.


695
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:31,146
Here we have two extensions,


696
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:32,996
one, on our Movie object that


697
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:34,836
knows how to return a Top Shelf


698
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:35,886
sectioned item.


699
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,256
And one on our MoviesResponse


700
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,606
that knows how to take all those


701
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:41,226
items and bundle them into a


702
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,356
sectioned content object.


703
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:43,966
Here, it has a title called


704
00:26:43,996 --> 00:26:45,486
Featured Movies and a list of


705
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:45,996
items.


706
00:26:46,516 --> 00:26:48,966
And our item class is kind of


707
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:49,376
boring.


708
00:26:49,506 --> 00:26:50,746
We only have a title right now.


709
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,176
So let's add some more


710
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:55,016
properties starting with images.


711
00:26:55,576 --> 00:26:58,356
Our API, like I said, allows you


712
00:26:58,356 --> 00:27:00,116
to specify images for both 1x


713
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:02,426
and 2x screen scales.


714
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:03,766
So here we're doing that and


715
00:27:03,766 --> 00:27:04,946
we're also setting the image


716
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:06,886
shape to HDTV, which means we


717
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:08,656
want 16 by 9 tiles in our


718
00:27:08,656 --> 00:27:09,606
Sectioned Top Shelf.


719
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:12,736
Now we need to handle user


720
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:13,416
actions.


721
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:14,276
What happened from the user


722
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:15,356
interacts with our item in Top


723
00:27:15,356 --> 00:27:15,736
Shelf?


724
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:17,786
Starting with displayAction.


725
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:19,146
This is what happens when the


726
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:20,706
user selects your item when it's


727
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:21,856
focused in Top Shelf.


728
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:24,166
And playAction is what happens


729
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,356
when the user presses the play


730
00:27:25,356 --> 00:27:27,196
button on the Siri Remote again


731
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:28,166
while the item is focused.


732
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,966
This will be delivered to your


733
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:32,296
application through its open URL


734
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:34,006
handler and it's important that


735
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:35,526
you take them directly to this


736
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:36,896
content as soon as possible.


737
00:27:38,386 --> 00:27:38,936
That's it.


738
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:40,426
Let's run this and see how it


739
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:40,726
looks.


740
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,086
Fantastic.


741
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,526
If you have an extension today


742
00:27:52,526 --> 00:27:54,356
that uses Top Shelf, this is


743
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:55,276
probably what it looks like.


744
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:56,826
We have Sectioned title.


745
00:27:56,826 --> 00:27:58,686
When we focus around, we can see


746
00:27:58,686 --> 00:27:59,906
the title of each item shows


747
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:01,046
underneath.


748
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,006
But we really want to use that


749
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:05,416
new immersive browse experience


750
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:06,156
in Top Shelf.


751
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:08,136
So let's go back to Xcode and


752
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:08,886
see what changes we have to


753
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:09,116
make.


754
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:12,756
The first thing we'll need is to


755
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:14,136
change our makeTopShelfItem


756
00:28:14,136 --> 00:28:16,096
function to return a TV Top


757
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:17,976
Shelf Carousel item instead.


758
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:26,986
And right away the compiler will


759
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:28,646
help us and tell us the image


760
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:29,646
shape isn't really valid


761
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:30,026
anymore.


762
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:31,216
So let's get rid of that line.


763
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:33,636
Now we need only to add two more


764
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:35,066
properties to fill out the rest


765
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,646
of our Carousel content.


766
00:28:37,836 --> 00:28:39,886
First is the Context Title,


767
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:41,276
again, that Section Header that


768
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:42,086
tells the user what we're


769
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:42,576
looking at.


770
00:28:43,776 --> 00:28:46,166
And the previewVideoURL, that's


771
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,646
what plays after we transition


772
00:28:47,646 --> 00:28:49,026
away from your image content.


773
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,706
And last, we need to update our


774
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:55,256
makeTopShelfContent function to


775
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:55,726
return a


776
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:57,846
TVTopShelfCarouselContent to


777
00:28:57,846 --> 00:28:58,906
match our Carousel item.


778
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:02,126
Here, we're requesting the


779
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:03,616
Action Style Carousel.


780
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:07,976
Great. Let's run this again.


781
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:21,956
Awesome. Look how great that


782
00:29:21,956 --> 00:29:22,396
looks!


783
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:24,676
We went from little Inset boxes


784
00:29:24,756 --> 00:29:27,366
of static content to this big


785
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,546
full screen playing preview


786
00:29:28,546 --> 00:29:29,586
video of our content.


787
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:31,726
When Felipe swipes up to enter


788
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:33,206
full screen mode, our UI gets


789
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:34,906
out of the way and he can swipe


790
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,566
between items to see what else


791
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,826
there is in our Top Shelf.


792
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,146
When he presses menu, we'll go


793
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:42,196
back to the up grid right where


794
00:29:42,196 --> 00:29:42,896
we left off.


795
00:29:44,276 --> 00:29:44,876
Now, let's go back to our


796
00:29:44,876 --> 00:29:45,926
project and make one more


797
00:29:45,926 --> 00:29:46,566
change.


798
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:48,456
We want to take advantage of


799
00:29:48,456 --> 00:29:50,236
that full rich meta-data that


800
00:29:50,236 --> 00:29:51,596
Top Shelf API offers.


801
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:53,026
So we'll add a few more


802
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:54,566
properties to our item class.


803
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:57,466
Like I mentioned, these are


804
00:29:57,466 --> 00:29:59,506
fields like summary, genre,


805
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:01,906
media options.


806
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:03,446
This just describes more


807
00:30:03,446 --> 00:30:04,836
contexts about the item we're


808
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,006
looking at to our viewers.


809
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:09,016
And last, let's update our


810
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,636
content object to return a


811
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:12,376
detail style Carousel.


812
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:15,756
Let's run this one more time.


813
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:21,866
So you'll notice that we only


814
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:23,836
changed a few classes and added


815
00:30:23,836 --> 00:30:25,296
a few properties to go all the


816
00:30:25,296 --> 00:30:26,706
way from Sectioned Content to


817
00:30:26,706 --> 00:30:28,646
this dynamic, immersive browse


818
00:30:28,646 --> 00:30:29,306
experience.


819
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:31,266
When Felipe swiped up to enter


820
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:32,176
full screen, you'll and notice


821
00:30:32,176 --> 00:30:33,036
that we don't show that


822
00:30:33,036 --> 00:30:34,336
meta-data UI right away.


823
00:30:34,386 --> 00:30:35,206
We don't want to overwhelm the


824
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:36,546
user with too much information


825
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:37,266
all at once.


826
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:39,346
So it's available on demand when


827
00:30:39,346 --> 00:30:41,096
he taps or clicks the Siri


828
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:41,406
Remote.


829
00:30:42,756 --> 00:30:43,566
In here, you see all the


830
00:30:43,566 --> 00:30:45,046
information we filled out just a


831
00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:45,566
moment ago.


832
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:46,936
That's it.


833
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:49,296
That's all it takes to adopt Top


834
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:50,846
Shelf in your apps.


835
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:51,516
Thanks, Felipe.


836
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:57,696
[ Applause ]


837
00:30:58,196 --> 00:31:00,206
So you saw how easy that was to


838
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:03,376
provide a great browse


839
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:05,586
experience in Top Shelf on Apple


840
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:06,316
TV.


841
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:10,266
And you saw the Carousel and how


842
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:11,876
it lets you go from a static


843
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:15,046
inset Top Shelf content to this


844
00:31:15,046 --> 00:31:17,516
big exciting captivating browse


845
00:31:17,516 --> 00:31:18,196
experience.


846
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:20,966
And, you saw the new extension


847
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,556
and API, which makes adopting


848
00:31:22,556 --> 00:31:24,146
all of this easier than ever.


849
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:26,406
We can't wait to see what all of


850
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,376
you do with Top Shelf in tvOS


851
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:29,016
13.


852
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:31,076
Now, I'd like to hand it over to


853
00:31:31,076 --> 00:31:32,636
Dale to talk about bringing that


854
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:34,546
content first design principles


855
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:36,426
inside your application.


856
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:37,576
Dale.


857
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:40,986
[ Applause ]


858
00:31:41,486 --> 00:31:42,656
>> Thanks, Caleb.


859
00:31:46,596 --> 00:31:48,016
My name is Dale Taylor and I'm


860
00:31:48,016 --> 00:31:49,336
an engineer on the tvOS team.


861
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:50,946
I'm going to start off today by


862
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:51,996
talking to you about User


863
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,756
Profiles and how you can use


864
00:31:53,756 --> 00:31:55,016
them to show people the content


865
00:31:55,016 --> 00:31:57,446
that they really want to see.


866
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,606
In tvOS 13, we're bringing


867
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:03,086
Control Center to the TV.


868
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:04,806
It gives people quick access to


869
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:06,666
common used actions, such as


870
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,656
Sleep, Search, and Now Playing.


871
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,266
Additionally, we've added user


872
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:11,446
switching right up at the top.


873
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:14,026
This gives people a lightweight


874
00:32:14,026 --> 00:32:15,456
way to quickly switch to their


875
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:16,496
personalized content and


876
00:32:16,496 --> 00:32:18,326
recommendations all without


877
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:19,186
losing context.


878
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:20,756
We're opening up this


879
00:32:20,756 --> 00:32:22,536
functionality to developers so


880
00:32:22,536 --> 00:32:23,756
you too can take advantage of


881
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:24,926
multiuser in your apps.


882
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:26,526
Let me show you what this looks


883
00:32:26,526 --> 00:32:26,766
like.


884
00:32:27,036 --> 00:32:27,966
I'll start with an example.


885
00:32:29,636 --> 00:32:31,916
How many of you had sat down to


886
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,966
watch TV only to be presented


887
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:34,786
with something that looks like


888
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,246
this?


889
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:37,106
Well, we want to make that a


890
00:32:37,106 --> 00:32:37,856
thing of the past.


891
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:39,906
While we're glad that your apps


892
00:32:39,906 --> 00:32:41,226
are providing great personalized


893
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:43,496
recommendations, ultimately, a


894
00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:45,586
screen like this isn't a content


895
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:46,596
first experience.


896
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,516
It can be especially frustrating


897
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:50,896
because in tvOS 13, the Apple TV


898
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:51,856
already knows who you are.


899
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,956
So why is it asking again?


900
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:55,906
Let's take a look at what we're


901
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:56,606
doing to help you.


902
00:32:57,196 --> 00:33:00,346
We have new API and TV services


903
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:03,376
in tvOS 13, TVUserManager to


904
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:04,746
help your profile-based apps


905
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:05,896
integrate with multiuser.


906
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:07,776
We do a few things for you.


907
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,456
We supply you an identifier that


908
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:11,866
represents the current user on


909
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,626
the TV, and we'll let you know


910
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:14,806
when that identifier changes.


911
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,806
This is important because with


912
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:18,476
Control Center, that can happen


913
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:19,416
even when your apps in the


914
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:19,996
foreground.


915
00:33:20,856 --> 00:33:22,596
We even supply you some system


916
00:33:22,596 --> 00:33:24,376
UI to help people using your app


917
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:26,266
map between our user identifiers


918
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:27,916
and your app's profiles.


919
00:33:29,546 --> 00:33:30,586
So what do you have to do to


920
00:33:30,586 --> 00:33:31,916
integrate with TVUserManager?


921
00:33:33,326 --> 00:33:35,306
Most importantly, you're


922
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,776
responsible for mapping between


923
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:38,516
a user identifier and a profile


924
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,666
in your app.


925
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:40,956
Generally, you would want to


926
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:41,776
store this in your user


927
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,416
defaults, mapping each user


928
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:45,016
identifier to a profile.


929
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:46,886
It's perfectly acceptable to


930
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:48,406
have multiple user identifiers


931
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:49,686
map to a single profile.


932
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:52,306
What this means is that you can


933
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:54,036
have multiple users on a TV and


934
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:55,256
they can share the same profile


935
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:56,996
in an app.


936
00:33:56,996 --> 00:33:58,426
And these user identifiers will


937
00:33:58,426 --> 00:33:59,766
be unique for every developer


938
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:00,066
team.


939
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:02,216
So if you have multiple apps or


940
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:03,786
extensions in your suite, you


941
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:04,516
can all share the same


942
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:05,166
preferences.


943
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:07,566
You're also responsible for


944
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:08,795
listening for changes in the


945
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:09,926
current user identifier.


946
00:34:09,926 --> 00:34:11,735
I'll get into some best


947
00:34:11,735 --> 00:34:14,085
practices on how to handle that


948
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:14,835
later.


949
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:16,346
It's also up to your apps to


950
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,636
call the methods you have to


951
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:19,146
present system UI in a way that


952
00:34:19,146 --> 00:34:20,166
makes sense for your app's


953
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:20,676
workflow.


954
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:22,606
But everyone's app is a little


955
00:34:22,606 --> 00:34:22,956
different.


956
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:24,186
So let's take a look at an


957
00:34:24,186 --> 00:34:24,626
example.


958
00:34:25,656 --> 00:34:27,295
Imagine your app puts up a


959
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:28,706
profile picker just like the one


960
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:29,616
I showed you before when it


961
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:29,956
launches.


962
00:34:31,176 --> 00:34:33,826
Well, here's what you do, before


963
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:35,235
you even put up your profile


964
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:36,606
picker, you check to see if your


965
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:38,166
app has a profile associated


966
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:38,835
with the current user


967
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:39,426
identifier.


968
00:34:39,755 --> 00:34:41,496
If it does, you can provide


969
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,735
people with the absolute best


970
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:43,406
experience.


971
00:34:44,485 --> 00:34:45,936
You can just let them watch TV.


972
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:47,426
You don't have to ask them any


973
00:34:47,426 --> 00:34:48,036
questions.


974
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:48,985
You don't have to show them any


975
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:49,746
selection screens.


976
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:51,166
You can just bring them right to


977
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:51,716
their content.


978
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:54,646
If you don't have a profile


979
00:34:54,646 --> 00:34:55,585
saved for the current user


980
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:57,296
identifier, now is when you put


981
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:58,446
up your app's profile picker.


982
00:34:59,226 --> 00:35:00,326
But when someone makes a


983
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:02,006
selection, you can ask them if


984
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:03,276
this is the right profile for


985
00:35:03,276 --> 00:35:04,666
the current user with this


986
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:05,176
dialogue.


987
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:07,866
This is the UI that will put up


988
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:09,566
asking the person using your app


989
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,566
if they want to associate the


990
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,146
current user identifier with the


991
00:35:12,146 --> 00:35:13,416
profile that was just selected.


992
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,626
If they say yes and you save the


993
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:16,966
result, they won't have to be


994
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:18,046
asked the next time.


995
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:19,176
So they can have the best


996
00:35:19,526 --> 00:35:20,636
experience when they launch the


997
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:21,426
app the next time.


998
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:23,516
So how do you put this UI on


999
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:23,936
screen?


1000
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:25,106
It's easy.


1001
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:26,556
You can do that with


1002
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:27,386
shouldStorePreference


1003
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:28,106
ForCurrentUser.


1004
00:35:29,356 --> 00:35:31,096
And you can also let people


1005
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,516
modify these mappings after the


1006
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:33,676
fact with the Preference Panel.


1007
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:35,236
You can present that with


1008
00:35:35,336 --> 00:35:36,706
presentProfilePreferencePanel.


1009
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:38,446
That UI looks like this.


1010
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:40,586
In this dialogue, you provide


1011
00:35:40,586 --> 00:35:42,176
the current mapping between user


1012
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:44,346
identifiers and profiles, and


1013
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:45,716
we'll give you back the changes.


1014
00:35:46,296 --> 00:35:47,806
For both this UI and the


1015
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:49,426
confirmation dialogue, you


1016
00:35:49,426 --> 00:35:51,676
provide usernames and user


1017
00:35:51,676 --> 00:35:53,206
identifiers and we'll supply the


1018
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:56,126
real user names in the UI.


1019
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,816
So, like I mentioned before,


1020
00:35:57,816 --> 00:35:58,556
your app should be able to


1021
00:35:58,556 --> 00:35:59,756
handle updates in the current


1022
00:35:59,756 --> 00:36:00,536
user identifier.


1023
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,606
You listen for changes in the


1024
00:36:02,606 --> 00:36:03,886
current user identifier with the


1025
00:36:03,886 --> 00:36:04,976
currentUserIdentifier


1026
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:06,146
DidChangeNotification.


1027
00:36:06,936 --> 00:36:08,486
And when this happens, you're


1028
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:09,586
responsible for letting us know


1029
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,486
the new mapping by setting user


1030
00:36:11,486 --> 00:36:13,126
identifiers for current profile.


1031
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:15,886
Since there can be multiple user


1032
00:36:15,886 --> 00:36:17,256
identifiers pointing to the same


1033
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:18,816
profile, you may set multiple


1034
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,406
values here.


1035
00:36:19,896 --> 00:36:21,216
So that's one thing you should


1036
00:36:21,216 --> 00:36:22,246
do when the user identifier


1037
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:22,716
changes.


1038
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:24,706
What else?


1039
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:25,736
Well, we have some best


1040
00:36:25,736 --> 00:36:27,416
practices that we recommend for


1041
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,496
dealing with profiles in your


1042
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:29,576
apps.


1043
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:31,686
If you have to change the


1044
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:33,346
profile and the previous profile


1045
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:35,506
had ongoing activity, save it


1046
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:36,666
because no one wants to lose


1047
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:37,166
what they're doing.


1048
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:39,786
And you should also make sure


1049
00:36:39,786 --> 00:36:41,426
that the change is meaningful.


1050
00:36:41,426 --> 00:36:43,046
So if-- You should be showing


1051
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:43,926
things like personalized


1052
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:45,856
recommendations, and make the


1053
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:46,536
change clear.


1054
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:48,296
So have it have a smooth


1055
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:50,146
transition and that will make it


1056
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:51,756
clear to people that the change


1057
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:52,346
was successful.


1058
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:57,216
So what do we learn about user


1059
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,426
profiles today on tvOS?


1060
00:36:58,946 --> 00:36:59,916
We learned that if you have a


1061
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:01,616
profile-based app, you can take


1062
00:37:01,616 --> 00:37:03,026
advantage of multiuser to get


1063
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:04,666
people better personalization.


1064
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,886
And you can use TVUserManager to


1065
00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:08,886
launch your app to a content


1066
00:37:08,956 --> 00:37:10,516
first experience, where people


1067
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:12,116
can skip unnecessary dialogues


1068
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,716
and go straight to watching TV.


1069
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,146
So now that I've talked about


1070
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:17,516
your first launch experience,


1071
00:37:18,006 --> 00:37:19,366
let's talk about what you'll see


1072
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:20,756
next in your app, the Tab Bar.


1073
00:37:28,936 --> 00:37:30,366
With the new TV app, we


1074
00:37:30,366 --> 00:37:31,456
introduce a new Tab Bar.


1075
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,346
It makes navigation easy.


1076
00:37:33,636 --> 00:37:34,956
And it really lets the content


1077
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:35,916
behind it shine.


1078
00:37:37,816 --> 00:37:39,386
Because it moves along


1079
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:40,446
vertically with the content


1080
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:41,986
rather than disappearing when it


1081
00:37:41,986 --> 00:37:44,066
loses focus, it's a great way to


1082
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:45,326
reinforce hierarchy for people


1083
00:37:45,326 --> 00:37:45,876
using an app.


1084
00:37:45,876 --> 00:37:48,286
I'm pleased to announce in tvOS


1085
00:37:48,286 --> 00:37:50,126
13, everyone gets this new Tab


1086
00:37:50,126 --> 00:37:50,936
Bar style.


1087
00:37:54,716 --> 00:37:55,796
So what do you have to do to


1088
00:37:55,796 --> 00:37:56,796
adopt the new Tab Bar?


1089
00:37:57,226 --> 00:37:59,026
In most cases nothing, but


1090
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,066
sometimes you'll want to modify


1091
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:01,296
the behavior and here's how.


1092
00:38:02,036 --> 00:38:03,286
If you want the Tab Bar to


1093
00:38:03,286 --> 00:38:04,666
scroll along with the content on


1094
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:05,996
your screen, you can set the


1095
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:07,076
tabBarObservedScrollView


1096
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,686
property on your view controller


1097
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:09,796
embedded within your Tab Bar


1098
00:38:09,796 --> 00:38:10,266
controller.


1099
00:38:10,986 --> 00:38:11,926
We generally recommend this


1100
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:13,136
style for collection views full


1101
00:38:13,136 --> 00:38:14,066
of browsable content.


1102
00:38:14,306 --> 00:38:15,566
In fact, UI Collection View


1103
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:16,596
Controller does this for you


1104
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:17,266
automatically.


1105
00:38:17,766 --> 00:38:19,526
If you'd like the Tab Bar to


1106
00:38:19,526 --> 00:38:20,546
stay fixed at the top of the


1107
00:38:20,546 --> 00:38:21,746
screen, you can just leave this


1108
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:22,636
property nil.


1109
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:25,586
In either of these cases, you


1110
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:26,646
should be mindful of the safe


1111
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:26,936
area.


1112
00:38:27,256 --> 00:38:28,596
For scroll views, you'll get the


1113
00:38:28,596 --> 00:38:30,186
right behavior for free if you


1114
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:30,596
just set the


1115
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:32,026
contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior


1116
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:33,116
to automatic.


1117
00:38:33,316 --> 00:38:34,446
If you're doing your own layout,


1118
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:35,106
you can use your view


1119
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:38,186
safeAreaLayoutGuide to help you.


1120
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:40,096
We're also adding some new API


1121
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:41,756
UITabBar so you can reflect your


1122
00:38:41,756 --> 00:38:42,726
branding in your apps.


1123
00:38:43,286 --> 00:38:44,846
We've added a new area to either


1124
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:46,536
side of the Tab Bar where you


1125
00:38:46,536 --> 00:38:47,316
can place a logo.


1126
00:38:47,316 --> 00:38:48,806
This will move along with the


1127
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:51,296
Tab Bar when it scrolls on and


1128
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,416
off screen.


1129
00:38:52,586 --> 00:38:53,856
You can access these two new


1130
00:38:53,856 --> 00:38:55,346
views within your properties in


1131
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:57,466
UITabBar, leadingAccessoryView


1132
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:58,626
and trailingAccessoryView.


1133
00:38:59,386 --> 00:39:00,396
You shouldn't put buttons where


1134
00:39:00,396 --> 00:39:01,386
there are focusable items in


1135
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:02,276
these accessory views.


1136
00:39:02,576 --> 00:39:03,376
They're really just designed for


1137
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:04,796
static content.


1138
00:39:05,106 --> 00:39:06,436
Additionally, if you need to do


1139
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:07,486
further customization on your


1140
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:08,666
Tab Bar to match your branding,


1141
00:39:09,186 --> 00:39:09,996
you can do that with the new


1142
00:39:09,996 --> 00:39:11,306
standardAppearance property.


1143
00:39:11,576 --> 00:39:12,566
To hear more about


1144
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:13,676
standardAppearance, see


1145
00:39:13,676 --> 00:39:15,756
Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13.


1146
00:39:15,946 --> 00:39:19,706
So what do we learn about Tab


1147
00:39:19,706 --> 00:39:20,796
Bars today on tvOS?


1148
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:22,876
Well, you get a new one in tvOS


1149
00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:24,756
13, and it's really easy to


1150
00:39:24,756 --> 00:39:26,446
integrate into your app.


1151
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:27,876
We've also made the Tab Bar more


1152
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:28,476
flexible.


1153
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:29,936
So you can have all the


1154
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:31,276
convenience of using a standard


1155
00:39:31,276 --> 00:39:32,846
control, but you don't have to


1156
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,136
sacrifice on your ability to


1157
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:34,956
show off your branding.


1158
00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:37,446
So now that we've seen how


1159
00:39:37,446 --> 00:39:39,086
UITabBar makes for great top


1160
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:40,146
level navigation in your app,


1161
00:39:40,386 --> 00:39:42,206
let's talk about browsing.


1162
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,566
We have some new tools that you


1163
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:46,206
can use to build a full screen


1164
00:39:46,206 --> 00:39:47,146
browsing experience.


1165
00:39:47,736 --> 00:39:50,236
Tommy mentioned earlier about


1166
00:39:50,236 --> 00:39:51,296
the importance of creating a


1167
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,796
browse experience that feels


1168
00:39:52,796 --> 00:39:54,946
lightweight and effortless, an


1169
00:39:54,946 --> 00:39:57,256
experience that gets you


1170
00:39:57,256 --> 00:39:58,946
immersed in a captivating story


1171
00:39:59,016 --> 00:40:00,206
more quickly than ever before,


1172
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,316
all without the frustration of


1173
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,976
diving in and out of menus.


1174
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:05,866
We built an experience that


1175
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:07,256
makes the most of the television


1176
00:40:07,316 --> 00:40:09,226
in its gigantic screen, an


1177
00:40:09,226 --> 00:40:10,596
experience that's perfect for


1178
00:40:10,596 --> 00:40:11,206
your living room.


1179
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:13,536
And using it is as simple as a


1180
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,666
horizontal swipe.


1181
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,156
In tvOs 13, we're introducing


1182
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:18,756
new API to help you build an


1183
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:19,856
experience just like the one you


1184
00:40:19,856 --> 00:40:20,456
see here.


1185
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:22,616
We're doing that with the new


1186
00:40:22,616 --> 00:40:23,386
TVCollectionView


1187
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:25,016
FullScreenLayout in TV UIKit.


1188
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:27,696
It's designed to help you build


1189
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:28,986
a collection view that fills the


1190
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:30,656
screen edge to edge, taking


1191
00:40:30,656 --> 00:40:31,806
advantage of the largest display


1192
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:32,406
in your house.


1193
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:34,356
By default, it will look


1194
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:35,796
familiar to people that used


1195
00:40:35,796 --> 00:40:37,506
tvOS already but it's highly


1196
00:40:37,506 --> 00:40:38,266
customizable.


1197
00:40:38,346 --> 00:40:39,966
So you can easily adjust it to


1198
00:40:39,966 --> 00:40:40,746
meet the goals of your


1199
00:40:40,746 --> 00:40:42,126
engineering and design teams.


1200
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:44,076
In fact, it's so customizable


1201
00:40:44,076 --> 00:40:45,596
that the Top Shelf that Caleb


1202
00:40:45,596 --> 00:40:47,136
showed you earlier even uses


1203
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:48,346
this exact the same layout.


1204
00:40:49,466 --> 00:40:50,636
To go along with this layout,


1205
00:40:50,636 --> 00:40:51,466
we're giving you when you a new


1206
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:53,456
cell subclass, TVCollectionView


1207
00:40:53,456 --> 00:40:54,146
FullScreenCell.


1208
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:57,156
It has two views that you need


1209
00:40:57,156 --> 00:40:58,476
to be aware of, the Masked


1210
00:40:58,476 --> 00:40:59,836
Background View and the Masked


1211
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:00,366
Content View.


1212
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:02,536
When you create a custom cell,


1213
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:03,856
these views are where you'll add


1214
00:41:03,856 --> 00:41:04,786
your content.


1215
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:06,216
Generally, you'll add an opaque


1216
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:07,606
image to the Masked Background


1217
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:09,676
View and UI elements to the


1218
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:10,376
Masked Content View.


1219
00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:12,976
Since this new Collection View


1220
00:41:12,976 --> 00:41:13,916
layout is designed to take


1221
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:15,276
advantage of the entire screen,


1222
00:41:16,236 --> 00:41:18,156
the cell and its sub-use also


1223
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:19,506
occupy the bounds of the display


1224
00:41:19,506 --> 00:41:22,326
in 1920 by 1080 points.


1225
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:23,546
Before I tell you more about how


1226
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:24,576
to customize a full screen


1227
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:26,356
layout, I'll invite Felipe back


1228
00:41:26,356 --> 00:41:28,056
up on stage to show you how easy


1229
00:41:28,056 --> 00:41:29,026
it is to build a full screen


1230
00:41:29,026 --> 00:41:30,176
browse experience using


1231
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:30,936
TVCollectionView


1232
00:41:30,936 --> 00:41:31,656
FullScreenLayout.


1233
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:38,508
[ Applause ]


1234
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,066
So we've started with an


1235
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:45,236
existing app that has some


1236
00:41:45,316 --> 00:41:46,796
photos in a simple flow layout.


1237
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,986
This is a good start but this


1238
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:50,606
isn't really optimized for the


1239
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:51,256
TV.


1240
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,646
So now that we've seen all this


1241
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:53,546
of that TVCollectionView


1242
00:41:53,546 --> 00:41:55,296
FullScreenLayout, let's go back


1243
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:58,616
to Xcode and try adopting it.


1244
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,276
We'll start by creating a new


1245
00:42:00,276 --> 00:42:01,286
fullScreenLayout.


1246
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:04,396
And we can set that layout in


1247
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,516
our Collection View replacing


1248
00:42:05,516 --> 00:42:05,976
the old one.


1249
00:42:10,856 --> 00:42:12,296
To go along with our layout,


1250
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:12,886
we'll need a cell.


1251
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:14,406
Luckily, we've already created


1252
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,896
one and we can register it with


1253
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:17,216
our Collection View.


1254
00:42:17,956 --> 00:42:21,036
Then we'll return an instance of


1255
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:23,016
this cell in our cell for item


1256
00:42:23,016 --> 00:42:23,586
indexPath.


1257
00:42:24,226 --> 00:42:26,536
Now we've setup our View


1258
00:42:26,536 --> 00:42:28,106
Controller, we can go to our


1259
00:42:28,106 --> 00:42:29,486
cell and add some content to it.


1260
00:42:29,796 --> 00:42:31,876
We already have an imageView and


1261
00:42:31,876 --> 00:42:32,506
a titleLabel.


1262
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:34,356
We can start off by adding the


1263
00:42:34,356 --> 00:42:35,276
imageView to the Masked


1264
00:42:35,276 --> 00:42:35,836
Background View.


1265
00:42:36,396 --> 00:42:40,256
And we can add our titleLabel to


1266
00:42:40,256 --> 00:42:41,126
our Masked Content View.


1267
00:42:42,266 --> 00:42:43,606
Let's give it a really big font


1268
00:42:43,606 --> 00:42:44,486
so it's easy to see on the


1269
00:42:44,486 --> 00:42:44,836
screen.


1270
00:42:44,836 --> 00:42:47,006
Now that we've got this all


1271
00:42:47,046 --> 00:42:48,666
setup, we can go give it a try.


1272
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:57,906
That's a lot better.


1273
00:42:57,906 --> 00:42:59,076
This really fills the screen and


1274
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,196
when you browse around, you can


1275
00:43:00,196 --> 00:43:01,276
see the images in much better


1276
00:43:01,276 --> 00:43:01,646
detail.


1277
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:04,166
But what would be great is if


1278
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,036
when you click on the Siri


1279
00:43:05,036 --> 00:43:06,576
Remote, it filled the screen.


1280
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,566
Luckily, that's easy to do.


1281
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:09,666
We can go back to our View


1282
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:13,516
Controller now and do that.


1283
00:43:14,076 --> 00:43:15,576
If we add didSelectItem in


1284
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:17,716
indexPath, we can handle the


1285
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:18,496
select action.


1286
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:20,136
When that happens, we can set


1287
00:43:20,136 --> 00:43:21,316
the Masked Amount to zero and


1288
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:22,786
will animate this to make it


1289
00:43:22,786 --> 00:43:23,236
look smooth.


1290
00:43:24,796 --> 00:43:25,826
Now, we can go ahead and try it


1291
00:43:25,826 --> 00:43:26,886
another time and see if that


1292
00:43:26,886 --> 00:43:27,946
does it.


1293
00:43:33,596 --> 00:43:35,616
You can see that when Felipe


1294
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:36,986
clicks, it fills the screen edge


1295
00:43:36,986 --> 00:43:37,936
to edge which is really what


1296
00:43:37,936 --> 00:43:38,696
we're looking to do.


1297
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:40,326
But it looks like we forgot to


1298
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,066
hide the text.


1299
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:43,536
No problem, that's an easy fix.


1300
00:43:43,536 --> 00:43:44,576
We can go back to our cell and


1301
00:43:44,576 --> 00:43:45,096
fix that now.


1302
00:43:46,706 --> 00:43:49,076
If we override apply, we can get


1303
00:43:49,076 --> 00:43:50,226
the layout attributes as they


1304
00:43:50,226 --> 00:43:50,776
change.


1305
00:43:51,716 --> 00:43:53,136
In this case, we want the


1306
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:55,276
titleLabel to have an alpha of


1307
00:43:55,276 --> 00:43:57,506
zero when the Masked Amount is


1308
00:43:57,506 --> 00:43:57,856
zero.


1309
00:43:57,856 --> 00:43:59,646
So we can just set the opacity


1310
00:43:59,996 --> 00:44:01,136
to the same as the Masked


1311
00:44:01,136 --> 00:44:01,406
Amount.


1312
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:04,896
Let's give it one more try and


1313
00:44:04,896 --> 00:44:05,436
see how it looks.


1314
00:44:12,456 --> 00:44:13,556
That's much better.


1315
00:44:13,996 --> 00:44:14,766
Now, this is the type of


1316
00:44:14,766 --> 00:44:15,846
experience we're trying to build


1317
00:44:15,846 --> 00:44:16,466
on the TV.


1318
00:44:16,736 --> 00:44:17,956
It's really easy to interact


1319
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:20,226
with and you can easily get lost


1320
00:44:20,226 --> 00:44:21,246
in the content when it fills the


1321
00:44:21,246 --> 00:44:21,996
screen like this.


1322
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:23,606
Thanks, Felipe.


1323
00:44:24,516 --> 00:44:26,656
[ Applause ]


1324
00:44:27,156 --> 00:44:30,156
Now we can go back to the


1325
00:44:30,156 --> 00:44:30,696
details.


1326
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:31,686
You remember


1327
00:44:31,686 --> 00:44:33,086
TVCollectionViewFullScreenCell


1328
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:34,226
from before, and its two


1329
00:44:34,226 --> 00:44:35,986
sub-use, Masked Background and


1330
00:44:35,986 --> 00:44:36,806
Masked Content View.


1331
00:44:37,646 --> 00:44:38,986
In order to understand how these


1332
00:44:38,986 --> 00:44:40,596
two views work together, you'll


1333
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:41,446
need to understand two


1334
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:42,586
principles of the layout,


1335
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:44,636
masking and parallax.


1336
00:44:44,806 --> 00:44:45,916
Let's start with masking.


1337
00:44:47,136 --> 00:44:48,946
The views and the cell are


1338
00:44:48,946 --> 00:44:50,176
layered on top of one another


1339
00:44:50,176 --> 00:44:52,046
and fill the whole screen.


1340
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:53,166
You can see the Masked


1341
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:55,296
Background View here and the


1342
00:44:55,296 --> 00:44:56,256
Content View on top.


1343
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:58,166
When running edge to edge like


1344
00:44:58,166 --> 00:44:59,576
this, the Masked Amount


1345
00:44:59,576 --> 00:45:01,316
specified by the layout in cell


1346
00:45:01,316 --> 00:45:02,016
would be zero.


1347
00:45:03,146 --> 00:45:04,546
But when we're browsing around


1348
00:45:04,546 --> 00:45:05,996
in inset from the sides like


1349
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:07,806
this, the Masked Amount is one.


1350
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:11,316
You can control the amount of


1351
00:45:11,316 --> 00:45:12,556
the masked inset with the Masked


1352
00:45:12,556 --> 00:45:13,826
Inset Property in the layout.


1353
00:45:15,116 --> 00:45:16,306
The same information is


1354
00:45:16,306 --> 00:45:17,486
reflected in the cell with the


1355
00:45:17,486 --> 00:45:18,836
Content Bleed Property that it


1356
00:45:18,836 --> 00:45:20,186
gets from the layout attributes.


1357
00:45:20,826 --> 00:45:23,186
So that's masking.


1358
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:24,396
Let's talk about parallax.


1359
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:26,456
Parallax is just a way to create


1360
00:45:26,456 --> 00:45:27,746
depth by moving layers at


1361
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:28,476
different rates.


1362
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,346
We do this all over tvOS


1363
00:45:30,346 --> 00:45:30,736
already.


1364
00:45:30,736 --> 00:45:32,366
Let me explain how that applies


1365
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:33,686
to our layout.


1366
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:36,556
The layout has a Parallax Factor


1367
00:45:36,556 --> 00:45:37,046
property.


1368
00:45:37,246 --> 00:45:39,006
It specifies how much slower the


1369
00:45:39,006 --> 00:45:40,396
Masked Background View most


1370
00:45:40,396 --> 00:45:41,706
relative to the Masked Content


1371
00:45:42,246 --> 00:45:42,366
View.


1372
00:45:43,376 --> 00:45:45,426
The same information is passed


1373
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:46,506
down to the cell through the


1374
00:45:46,506 --> 00:45:47,546
layout attributes and the


1375
00:45:47,546 --> 00:45:48,866
parallax offset property.


1376
00:45:49,506 --> 00:45:50,746
This specifies the distance


1377
00:45:50,746 --> 00:45:51,926
between the center of the Masked


1378
00:45:51,926 --> 00:45:53,296
Background and Masked Content


1379
00:45:53,296 --> 00:45:54,356
View at any point in time.


1380
00:45:55,246 --> 00:45:56,576
With different rates of motion


1381
00:45:56,576 --> 00:45:57,826
and a partially transparent


1382
00:45:57,826 --> 00:45:59,816
Masked Content View, you can see


1383
00:45:59,816 --> 00:46:00,916
how we'd be able to simulate a


1384
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,346
sense of depth.


1385
00:46:05,156 --> 00:46:06,706
Finally, when combined together


1386
00:46:06,706 --> 00:46:08,466
with the mask, we get the wipe


1387
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:09,746
effect that you saw on Felipe's


1388
00:46:09,746 --> 00:46:10,026
demo.


1389
00:46:10,736 --> 00:46:14,316
As a reminder, we do the heavy


1390
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:15,156
lifting for you in


1391
00:46:15,156 --> 00:46:15,876
TVCollectionView


1392
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:17,476
FullScreenLayout, but this


1393
00:46:17,506 --> 00:46:18,686
overview should have helped you


1394
00:46:18,686 --> 00:46:19,656
understand some of the


1395
00:46:19,656 --> 00:46:20,806
parameters that you can use to


1396
00:46:21,066 --> 00:46:22,266
get exactly the effect you're


1397
00:46:22,266 --> 00:46:22,706
looking for.


1398
00:46:23,256 --> 00:46:26,056
Since there are a lot of pixels


1399
00:46:26,056 --> 00:46:27,136
moving around in a full screen


1400
00:46:27,136 --> 00:46:28,656
layout like this, we have some


1401
00:46:28,656 --> 00:46:30,126
best practices that we recommend


1402
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:31,106
for getting the most out of


1403
00:46:31,106 --> 00:46:31,766
TVCollectionView


1404
00:46:31,766 --> 00:46:32,436
FullScreenLayout.


1405
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,766
You should avoid starting any


1406
00:46:35,766 --> 00:46:37,096
animations or video until the


1407
00:46:37,096 --> 00:46:38,116
cell reaches the center.


1408
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:40,056
Playing multiple videos at once


1409
00:46:40,056 --> 00:46:41,186
will not only be distracting to


1410
00:46:41,186 --> 00:46:42,336
people using your app, but it


1411
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:43,596
will probably cause you drop


1412
00:46:43,596 --> 00:46:44,106
frames.


1413
00:46:44,686 --> 00:46:46,786
You should watch how many


1414
00:46:46,786 --> 00:46:48,106
offscreen passes you're using.


1415
00:46:48,376 --> 00:46:49,656
This means avoiding excessive


1416
00:46:49,656 --> 00:46:51,566
use of visual effects or group


1417
00:46:51,566 --> 00:46:52,736
opacity animations.


1418
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:54,356
Really, most of the things that


1419
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:56,276
you'd use to help with scrolling


1420
00:46:56,276 --> 00:46:57,396
in the rest of your app, you


1421
00:46:57,396 --> 00:46:58,526
could apply here when swiping


1422
00:46:58,526 --> 00:47:00,876
side to side.


1423
00:47:01,106 --> 00:47:02,086
You should also be mindful of


1424
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:02,996
your memory usage.


1425
00:47:03,306 --> 00:47:04,506
You'll probably be working with


1426
00:47:04,506 --> 00:47:05,876
a lot of large images in a


1427
00:47:05,876 --> 00:47:06,686
layout like this.


1428
00:47:06,976 --> 00:47:08,536
So, you should make sure that


1429
00:47:08,536 --> 00:47:09,886
their sized appropriately for


1430
00:47:09,886 --> 00:47:11,646
the display and that you release


1431
00:47:11,646 --> 00:47:12,766
them from memory when you're not


1432
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:13,476
using them anymore.


1433
00:47:17,136 --> 00:47:19,016
If you're a TVMLKit developer,


1434
00:47:19,016 --> 00:47:20,136
don't think we forgot about you.


1435
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:21,836
You can access all of these for


1436
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:23,066
TVBrowserViewController.


1437
00:47:23,736 --> 00:47:25,086
We'll even link to a sample app


1438
00:47:25,086 --> 00:47:26,536
that shows you how easy it is to


1439
00:47:26,536 --> 00:47:27,866
build a smooth transition from a


1440
00:47:27,866 --> 00:47:29,576
shelf to a full screen browse


1441
00:47:29,576 --> 00:47:30,726
and back.


1442
00:47:32,476 --> 00:47:33,906
Today, we've taken you on a


1443
00:47:33,906 --> 00:47:35,676
journey, starting with people's


1444
00:47:35,676 --> 00:47:37,126
first exposure to your app, the


1445
00:47:37,126 --> 00:47:38,546
home screen and the Top Shelf.


1446
00:47:39,476 --> 00:47:40,466
It's a great way to grab


1447
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:41,736
people's attention and draw them


1448
00:47:41,736 --> 00:47:42,126
into your app.


1449
00:47:43,256 --> 00:47:44,856
Then we moved on to the first


1450
00:47:44,856 --> 00:47:46,696
launch experience where you


1451
00:47:47,256 --> 00:47:48,796
learned how you can integrate


1452
00:47:48,796 --> 00:47:50,416
with multiuser to bring people


1453
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:51,646
to their personalized content


1454
00:47:51,646 --> 00:47:53,196
right away without the need for


1455
00:47:53,196 --> 00:47:53,946
additional dialogues.


1456
00:47:55,296 --> 00:47:57,686
And, finally, we learned how you


1457
00:47:57,686 --> 00:47:59,096
can make browsing simple and


1458
00:47:59,096 --> 00:48:00,906
effortless with our new Tab Bar


1459
00:48:00,906 --> 00:48:01,736
and full screen layout.


1460
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:04,236
Together, all these made for


1461
00:48:04,236 --> 00:48:05,496
great usability in the living


1462
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:05,756
room.


1463
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:07,636
We hope you take the tools and


1464
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:09,036
principles that we've shown you


1465
00:48:09,036 --> 00:48:10,706
here today and apply them in


1466
00:48:10,706 --> 00:48:12,376
your own apps so that everyone


1467
00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:14,106
using tvOS can have an enjoyable


1468
00:48:14,106 --> 00:48:14,746
experience.


1469
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:17,556
You can see more information


1470
00:48:17,556 --> 00:48:19,216
about our talk here and come see


1471
00:48:19,216 --> 00:48:20,336
us on our labs in Wednesday and


1472
00:48:20,336 --> 00:48:20,856
Friday.


1473
00:48:23,006 --> 00:48:23,726
Thanks everybody.


1474
00:48:24,516 --> 00:48:29,500
[ Applause ]
