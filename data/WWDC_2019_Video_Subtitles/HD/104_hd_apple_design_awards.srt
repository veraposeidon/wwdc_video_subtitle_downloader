00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:09,566
>> Good evening, developers, and


3
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:13,376
welcome to the 2019 Apple Design


4
00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:13,666
Awards.


5
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:16,065
Now, here's your host, Senior


6
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:18,286
Director of Evangelism, John

9
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:28,886
>> Hello. Well, hello, and


10
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:30,806
welcome to another Apple Design


11
00:00:30,806 --> 00:00:31,176
Awards.


12
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:32,936
Thanks for joining us this


13
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:34,606
afternoon, especially after a


14
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:36,756
long, but exciting day.


15
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:39,116
And I just want to particularly


16
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:40,716
thank all of you who have joined


17
00:00:40,716 --> 00:00:43,016
us from around the world online


18
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:44,296
on the live stream for the


19
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:45,246
ceremony right now.


20
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:47,266
We've got a huge group.


21
00:00:50,136 --> 00:00:52,046
You know, it's great for us to


22
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:53,626
join as a community, and gather


23
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:55,856
like this to take a few moments


24
00:00:56,476 --> 00:00:58,686
to celebrate and acknowledge


25
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,356
excellence in innovation and


26
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:00,756
design.


27
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,386
Because at Apple, we've been


28
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:05,306
awarding excellent design for


29
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:06,666
more than two decades now.


30
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:09,886
What started originally as the


31
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:11,556
Apple Human Interface Design


32
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:13,196
Excellence Awards, or HIDE


33
00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:15,396
Awards for short, was renamed a


34
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:17,606
few years later to what is now


35
00:01:17,606 --> 00:01:19,456
known as the Apple Design


36
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:20,000
Awards.


37
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,676
You know, the world around us is


38
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:27,856
stunningly beautiful, and as


39
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,616
humans, we're attracted to


40
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:32,436
beautiful things, and to


41
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:33,476
incredible designs.


42
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:36,806
We're drawn to these things, and


43
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,496
we respond to them deeply.


44
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:42,056
And at Apple, we believe the


45
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:43,466
true -- the beauty -- that


46
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:44,916
beautiful design is both


47
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,936
appearance and function, and


48
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:49,796
something that works well with


49
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:51,416
each component deeply


50
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,046
considered, and each aspect


51
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:55,326
carefully crafted -- that that


52
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:56,986
can be profoundly beautiful.


53
00:01:58,366 --> 00:01:59,936
And so, simply judging something


54
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:02,146
by how it looks isn't enough.


55
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,356
It's how it works.


56
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:06,746
It has to work as beautifully as


57
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:10,425
it looks, and great design


58
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:12,126
reflects the broader definition


59
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:12,946
of beauty.


60
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:15,486
And it runs deeper than the


61
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:16,066
interface.


62
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:18,136
It's coherent, and it's


63
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:19,116
cohesive.


64
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:21,446
And it helps us to engage with


65
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:23,276
each other in new, and


66
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,176
innovative, and life-enhancing


67
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:27,556
ways, and like compelling


68
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:29,966
beauty, great design draws us


69
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:30,736
in.


70
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:33,836
And the Apple Design Awards have


71
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:35,306
always been about this --


72
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:38,026
recognizing great design, and


73
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:40,526
then celebrating the developers


74
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,486
who positively impact everyone


75
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:44,226
else, and real people with the


76
00:02:44,226 --> 00:02:46,196
things that they create, the


77
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:47,546
things that you create.


78
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:51,116
Now, we select our winners each


79
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:53,476
year by evaluating them in


80
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:56,000
basically three key areas.


81
00:02:57,326 --> 00:02:58,616
The first area is design.


82
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:01,836
We're looking for apps that are


83
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,586
-- that have strong visual


84
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:06,566
design, that are efficient and


85
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:09,366
easy to use, that have great


86
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:12,336
game play, that have attention


87
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:15,136
to detail and polish, that are


88
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:16,636
internally coherent.


89
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:19,876
On the technology front, we're


90
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:22,486
evaluating technology usage, and


91
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:23,636
so we're looking for apps that


92
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,096
are fast and responsive.


93
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,216
We're looking for apps that take


94
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:28,946
full advantage of all of the


95
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:30,186
capabilities of our latest


96
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:32,506
devices, and we're looking for


97
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,926
apps that use the latest Apple


98
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:37,686
technologies to do really great


99
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:38,466
new things.


100
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,836
And on the innovation front,


101
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,216
we're looking for brilliance.


102
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,306
We're looking for new ideas.


103
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,296
We're looking for uniqueness,


104
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:54,476
platform differentiation, and


105
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:55,606
things that just weren't


106
00:03:55,606 --> 00:03:56,666
possible before.


107
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:59,996
And the developers of our


108
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:02,116
winning apps this evening have


109
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,276
done an outstanding job, and


110
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:06,086
outstanding work in these three


111
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:09,106
areas, and more, and we want to


112
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:10,096
honor that work.


113
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:12,266
We want to acknowledge the


114
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,766
distinct joy and the challenges


115
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:16,466
of the app creation process that


116
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,706
we're all so familiar with.


117
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:20,426
We want to honor the endless


118
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,926
hours, the late nights, and the


119
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:24,886
dedication that goes into the


120
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:26,006
pursuit of excellence.


121
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:29,706
We want to recognize the


122
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:32,196
dead-ends, and the frustration,


123
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:34,196
and the exhaustion sometimes


124
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:37,626
that often goes unseen, and


125
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:38,786
we're all familiar with that.


126
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:41,066
And we want to honor the


127
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:43,086
unconventional thinking, the


128
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:45,756
creativity, and the new ideas


129
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:48,176
that lead to breakthroughs and


130
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:49,496
innovative solutions.


131
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:51,216
So let's get started.


132
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:53,936
Winners tonight are going to win


133
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:55,956
some pretty great -- some pretty


134
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:58,846
amazing prizes, and each prize


135
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:02,206
package includes a 512 gigabyte


136
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:04,446
iPhone XS with a set of AirPods,


137
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,456
a 512 gigabyte 12.9-inch iPad


138
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,466
Pro with Apple Pencil 2,


139
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:18,646
a 64 gigabyte 4K Apple TV, an


140
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,346
Apple Watch Series 4,


141
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:27,066
a top-of-the-line MacBook Pro,


142
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:30,786
and a fully-loaded iMac Pro.


143
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,306
In addition --


144
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:37,606
in addition -- and this is what


145
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:41,136
all of you want -- each winner


146
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:42,786
will -- each winning develop --


147
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:43,946
each winning app will be


148
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:45,246
highlighted on the App Store,


149
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:47,066
similar to what we did last year


150
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:48,406
on the Today tab for the Apple


151
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:49,776
Design Award winners, and what


152
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:51,016
we did throughout the year


153
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,506
following the ceremony.


154
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:53,906
So this year's winners will be


155
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:55,456
highlighted in prominent ways on


156
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,246
the App Stores.


157
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:58,546
And lastly, each winner will


158
00:05:58,546 --> 00:06:00,076
take home one of the coveted


159
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:01,636
Apple Design Award trophies,


160
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:06,776
except that we thought it was


161
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,016
time for a refresh.


162
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,476
And so, we have a completely new


163
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:13,466
trophy this year, redesigned


164
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:15,036
from the Apple Design Team.


165
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:17,146
It retains the integrity and


166
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:18,596
recognizable qualities of the


167
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:21,166
original award, but reinterprets


168
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,786
these with the qualities of our


169
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:23,706
latest products.


170
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:26,596
It's made out of 100% recycled


171
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,686
aluminum, and featured a


172
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:29,986
mirror-finished stainless steel


173
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:31,766
Apple logo inlay.


174
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:33,966
It's pretty sweet, if you ask


175
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:34,330
me.


176
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:37,326
All right.


177
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:41,326
So we have nine -- we have nine


178
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,546
winners today, and each winner


179
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:45,336
will be announced and demoed by


180
00:06:45,336 --> 00:06:46,706
a colleague -- by colleagues of


181
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,576
mine from the Apple -- from the


182
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:49,446
-- from Apple's World Wide


183
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:50,896
Developer Relations Team.


184
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,706
Now, a little bit differently


185
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,316
than other years -- if we


186
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:55,846
announce your app, if we


187
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:57,566
announce you as a winner, please


188
00:06:57,606 --> 00:06:59,596
stay in your seat because we're


189
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:00,726
going to first talk about your


190
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:02,456
app, and explain it to the


191
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,296
community.


192
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:04,816
And we're going to demo it, and


193
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:06,436

For our first award today, we


207
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:36,656

208
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,566

Okay, Oscar, let's take this

00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:11,336
game for a spin.


222
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:13,996
Ordia tells the story of a first


223
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:16,066
life form emerging from this


224
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:18,466
gooey primordial soup, and then


225
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:20,406

avoid being eaten or killed.


231
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:30,966
Ordia has its amazingly-rich and


232
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:33,015
vibrant design style, a lovely

[ Game Sounds ]


238
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:44,676
What we love about this game is


239
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:46,296
that it's intuitive enough so


240
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:48,376
you simply start playing, and it


241
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,076
introduces rules and challenges


242
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:51,916
gradually as you go through the


243
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:53,176
levels.


244
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:54,986
It uses colors to communicate


245
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:55,936
the roles of each element.


246
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,416
Green and yellow things are


247
00:08:57,476 --> 00:08:59,146
friendly, while pink things must


248
00:08:59,176 --> 00:08:59,726
be avoided.


249
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:02,316
It also leverages our Taptic

251
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:05,796
you get this subtle and

00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:06,886
satisfying feedback while you

254
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:12,616
Ordia has three universes.


255
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:15,906
They are immersive, consistent,


256
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,786
yet also distinct from each


257
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:19,626

258
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,176

267
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,246
I love the pacing of this game.


268
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:37,106
The challenges alternate


269
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:38,716
smoothly between speed, timing,


270
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:42,136
and accuracy, while also offers

you these little resting pods,

where your Ordia can regenerate


273
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:46,826
if it dies, so you can breathe a


274
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:47,156
little.


275
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:49,706
The balance between difficulty


276
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,546
and satisfaction is very well


277
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:53,136
managed, so you just feel like


278
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,716

353
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:53,826
up the drawing tools in advance,


354
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:55,516

would expect a pen to look, and


369
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,876
they have great markers with

00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:27,486

Now, playing with these tools --


376
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:37,606
it kind of -- it takes me back

00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:51,386

often take me with her, and I


387
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,946

388

experience, but the real heart


393
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:06,706
of the interface here is


394
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:08,536
customizing the drawing tools.


395
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:10,866
Everything in this interface is


396
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:12,336
animated, and they even have


397
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,656
these really great optional


398
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:14,436

00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:16,126
Check out when you change the


400
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:18,546
brush size, how the nibs change


401
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:20,696
in response, or when you change


402
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:23,386
the nibs, they pop on and pop


403
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:23,736
off.


404
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,086
But the heart of this interface


405
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:27,256
is changing the color.


406
00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:29,636
You adjust the value on the side


407
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,896
here on the right, swipe side to


408
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,506
side to adjust saturation, and


409
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,646
color by just spinning the color


410
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:37,056
wheel.


411
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:39,926
And check out how all of these


412
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:41,646
-- all of these colors have


413
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:42,706
unique names.


414
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:45,166
There's 1400 names in all.


415
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,876
It's just like a real marker


416
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:47,226
set.


417
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:50,166
Now, I'm feeling inspired to


418
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,356
actually draw something, so to


419
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:54,236
extend the canvas and stay in a


420
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:56,276
state of flow, I just swipe over


421
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:56,946
to the side.


422
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,256
I'll draw something in the theme


423
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:01,236
of calligraphy in front of a


424
00:15:01,236 --> 00:15:02,446
couple thousand people, so


425
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:03,596
hopefully I do this all right.


426
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:05,596
I'm going to draw a little

428
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:08,116
So I'm just going to trace in


429
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,886
the outline with a felt-tip

431

It's looking pretty good.


432
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:18,136
It's a little bit flat, so I


433
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:20,886
think I'm going to add in some


434
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:21,676
shading.


435
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,386
It's a little bit more


436
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:25,786
realistic.


437
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:29,616
And then zoom in here -- whoops


438
00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:34,876

440

Now, beyond the stunning imagery

that you see, what really


493
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:29,756
impressed us about this game is


494
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:31,226
that this kind of attention to


495
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,696
detail actually extends to its


496
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,286
bespoke soundtrack, its

00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:37,236
natural-feeling haptics, and

00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:38,746
more than that, the

500
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,246
Notice how Frendt is taken aback


501
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,716
when Arina's able to walk over


502
00:18:43,716 --> 00:18:45,896
the clouds, and then he catches


503
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:47,716
up, still a little unsure.


504
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:50,396
And here, I just stopped time,


505
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,636
and I do that by just not


506
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:54,456
tapping anything.


507
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:55,616
This means that I'm never


508
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:57,696
feeling rushed or under any kind


509
00:18:57,696 --> 00:18:58,316
of time pressure.

00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:01,066
We think this game play mechanic


511
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:05,126
is really simple, yet effective.


512
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:06,196
Now, because you move both


513
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:07,936
characters at once, and only


514
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:09,986
control the flow of time, an


515
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:11,426
interesting interplay happens


516
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,876
between the two characters.


517
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:16,396
Here, you will notice that Arina


518
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:18,056
is no longer able to move any


519
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,126
more forward in time, and that's


520
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:21,506
because Frendt has fallen

each time I hop over the saw


527
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:33,046

Let's get started.


700
00:26:25,096 --> 00:26:26,956
I've got this great image of


701
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:28,546
this boy playing soccer on a


702
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,366

703
00:26:30,366 --> 00:26:32,236
a few simple adjustments, we can


704
00:26:32,236 --> 00:26:33,856
really make this photo pop.


705
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,096
I'm first going to hit the


706
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:36,856
Auto-Enhance button, which is


707
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,246
already making this look quite a


708
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:40,076
bit better.


709
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:41,506
But I want it to have a more


710
00:26:41,506 --> 00:26:43,626
vintage look to it, and for


711
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:44,816
that, I'm going to have a look


712
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:46,906
at some of the many built-in


713
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:47,856

714
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,156
I love all these different film


715
00:26:50,156 --> 00:26:52,536
looks, and the urban looks, but


716
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:53,656
I specifically like these


717
00:26:53,726 --> 00:26:54,846

718
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:56,526
So I'm going to choose number 2.


719
00:26:57,346 --> 00:26:59,226
I think that looks really good,


720
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,766
and there's one more thing I


721
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:02,666
want to do to this image, which


722
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,666
is to crop it before I share it


723
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:06,206
with my friends.


724
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:09,036
And what's really unique about


725
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:10,796
the cropping in Pixelmator Photo


726
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,596
is, the team trained a custom


727
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:15,436
Core ML model on thousands and


728
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:16,696
thousands of images to gain a


729
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:18,576
deep understanding of the

content of the photos.


731
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:24,506
And by doing that, they let me,


732
00:27:24,846 --> 00:27:26,666
as their customer, just simply


733
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,066
enable this Smart Cropping


734
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:30,166

735
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,906
different aspect ratio, like a


736
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,126

737
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:35,116

738
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:36,576
this perfectly-cropped image


739
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,216

740
00:27:37,216 --> 00:27:39,446

00:27:40,546 --> 00:27:41,776

this lovely couple in New York.


746
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:51,026

747
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:52,406
of the photos we have in our


748

00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,016
It's a really sweet moment, but


750
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:57,466
it suffers from a very


751
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,636
unfortunate lighting situation.


752
00:28:00,236 --> 00:28:03,116
I'm going to use the ML Enhance


753
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:05,806
again to immediately improve the


754
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:08,216

755
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:09,596

756
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:10,306

00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:31,996
Understanding all these


767
00:28:31,996 --> 00:28:33,716
individual adjustments on your


768
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:36,346
own can be very daunting, but


769
00:28:36,346 --> 00:28:37,816
with the ML Enhance feature,


770
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,496
it's a perfect place to start.


771
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:41,366
I can do something like simply


772
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,006
bump the black point just a


773
00:28:43,006 --> 00:28:45,186
little bit more, and I think


774
00:28:45,186 --> 00:28:46,026
that looks great.


775
00:28:46,756 --> 00:28:48,406
I can deep-press on this photo


776
00:28:48,406 --> 00:28:50,136
to compare it, and I think


777
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:51,486
you'll agree that's a much


778
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:53,236
better version of this image.


779
00:28:54,016 --> 00:28:55,666
So that's just a very quick tour


780
00:28:56,696 --> 00:29:00,096
of the simplicity of Pixelmator

Photo.


782
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:04,746
By leveraging Metal and Core ML,


783
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:06,076
the app is fast, and it's


784
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:06,756
intelligent.


785
00:29:06,756 --> 00:29:09,336
And with this beautiful, simple


786
00:29:09,336 --> 00:29:11,226
UI, and direct integration with


787
00:29:11,226 --> 00:29:14,756

788
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:16,066
editing for everyone.


789
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:18,066
Amazing app.

798
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:38,546
Pixelmator Photo uses Apple


799

technologies to do new things,


800
00:30:40,946 --> 00:30:42,176
and this isn't the first time


801
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,056
that this team has been on

reason.


805
00:30:47,216 --> 00:30:48,636
The Pixelmator Team is


806
00:30:48,706 --> 00:30:51,366
consistently in lockstep with


807
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:53,346
new devices that we release, and


808
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:54,396

809
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:56,376
Phenomenal, phenomenal work.

815
00:31:13,596 --> 00:31:15,476
for its beautiful animation,


816
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:16,946
illustration, and creative

approach to throwing a ball at a

block.


819
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,626
While you play, you learn basic


820
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:24,126
physics and geometry with rhythm


821
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:24,636
and music.


822
00:31:25,546 --> 00:31:27,216
Now, music and sound effects are


823
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:28,906
key elements to helping you


824
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:30,446
solve this chilled-out puzzle


825
00:31:30,446 --> 00:31:30,696
game.


826
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:33,236
You can play, relax, and


827

decompress all while finding


828
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:36,436
your groove.


829
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,696
Now, I absolutely love playing


830
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,026
this game, and I know you do,


831
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:39,706
too, Paolo.


832
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:40,126
>> Yeah, I do.


833
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:42,106
>> Will you help us take a look?


834
00:31:42,106 --> 00:31:43,176
>> I do, actually, Lauren.


835
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:45,056
I actually love playing this


836
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:47,296
game with my son, Luca.


837
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:48,236
It's his favorite game right


838
00:31:48,236 --> 00:31:50,226
now, and the reason for that is


839
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:51,396
that the first time you launch


840
00:31:51,396 --> 00:31:53,026
ELOH, you realize that there is


841
00:31:53,026 --> 00:31:53,706
no onboarding.


842
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:55,266
There are no instructions.


843
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:58,026
Just like many great iOS games,


844
00:31:58,026 --> 00:31:59,766
you just learn by playing.


845
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:01,766
Now, the goal of the game is to


846
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:03,656
get the little ball that emits


847
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:05,496
from this speaker down to the


848
00:32:05,496 --> 00:32:07,686
target, and you do that by --


849
00:32:07,686 --> 00:32:09,886
you achieve that by tapping on


850
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,566
these tribal masks, and moving


851
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:14,436
them around the screen.


852
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:14,866
Great.


853
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:16,716
I think my reputation is saved.


854
00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:18,496
Level four is done.


855
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:20,746
Now, the game has 99 levels, and


856
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:23,256
as you would expect, things can


857
00:32:23,256 --> 00:32:25,486
get more complicated.


858
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:28,546
Yet, the game still offers a


859
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,866
very relaxing experience, and I


860
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,956
think the key component here is


861
00:32:32,956 --> 00:32:34,396
the sound effects, and the


862
00:32:34,396 --> 00:32:36,646
soundtrack, which complements


863
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:39,916
the beautiful graphics and


864
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,076
delightful animations.


865
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:43,006
And the other fun aspect is


866
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:44,446
that, while you're playing,


867
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:46,056
you're actually composing your


868
00:32:46,056 --> 00:32:47,646
very own soundtrack.


869
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:48,216
Cool.


870
00:32:48,476 --> 00:32:52,736
Let's get through level 12.


871
00:32:52,926 --> 00:32:53,306
Great.


872
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:54,906
Now, level 12 is special,


873
00:32:55,046 --> 00:32:57,116
because we get rewarded with a


874
00:32:57,116 --> 00:32:58,616
little totem animation.


875
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,826
What is also fun about this game


876
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:02,346
is that there is no score.


877
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:04,576
There is no -- there are no time


878
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:05,196
constraints.


879
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:08,436
Therefore, a little six-year-old


880
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:10,506
kid can play without any time


881
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:12,896
pressure, or fear of making


882
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:13,696
mistakes.


883
00:33:15,306 --> 00:33:17,446

00:44:36,776 --> 00:44:38,556
use a tripod, but it's just as


1145
00:44:38,556 --> 00:44:40,676
common to use your iPhone popped


1146
00:44:40,676 --> 00:44:42,346
up against a water bottle.


1147
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:44,276
>> So the drill will get started


1148
00:44:44,276 --> 00:44:45,156
when I'm in the frame.


1149
00:44:45,486 --> 00:44:48,826
>> The iPhone camera, Core ML,


1150
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:50,466
and Vision frameworks are doing


1151
00:44:50,466 --> 00:44:52,456
all the work, not Doug.


1152
00:44:52,946 --> 00:44:55,126
But to be fair, Doug is really


1153
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:57,186
good, but even non-experts can


1154
00:44:57,186 --> 00:44:58,696
benefit from HomeCourt's ability


1155
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,006
to make them a better basketball


1156
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:00,276
player.


1157
00:45:01,006 --> 00:45:02,476
Lower and faster dribbling will


1158
00:45:02,476 --> 00:45:03,566
make you score more points.


1159
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:05,836
Faster, Doug, faster.


1160
00:45:06,596 --> 00:45:07,186
Good job.


1161
00:45:07,186 --> 00:45:09,396
>> So at the end of the drill, I


1162
00:45:09,396 --> 00:45:10,666
get a nice little summary.


1163
00:45:11,886 --> 00:45:13,136
>> And in addition to doing


1164
00:45:13,136 --> 00:45:14,196
these dribbling workouts,


1165
00:45:14,406 --> 00:45:15,816
HomeCourt is also great for


1166
00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:17,206
tracking shooting drills.


1167
00:45:17,526 --> 00:45:18,876
In fact, you can see up here on


1168
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:20,536
the screen, it has tracked your


1169
00:45:20,536 --> 00:45:22,276
makes and your misses, as well


1170
00:45:22,276 --> 00:45:23,816
as where you shot the ball from.


1171
00:45:24,196 --> 00:45:25,816
In fact, it also gives you this


1172
00:45:25,816 --> 00:45:27,066
nice video where you can see


1173
00:45:27,066 --> 00:45:28,716
your shots, and where you took


1174
00:45:28,716 --> 00:45:29,376
them from.


1175
00:45:29,986 --> 00:45:32,116
You know, Doug, this is really


1176
00:45:32,116 --> 00:45:32,866
revolutionary.


1177
00:45:33,376 --> 00:45:34,776
>> It's true, Larry [laughter].


1178
00:45:35,946 --> 00:45:37,686
Before HomeCourt, you would have


1179
00:45:37,686 --> 00:45:39,056
to do this stuff manually.


1180
00:45:39,056 --> 00:45:41,176
You'd have to have someone track


1181
00:45:41,176 --> 00:45:41,726
it for you.


1182
00:45:42,276 --> 00:45:43,306
>> Absolutely.


1183
00:45:43,346 --> 00:45:45,356
And today, you see kids, and


1184
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:47,636
even adults, using HomeCourt to


1185
00:45:47,636 --> 00:45:48,456
improve their skills.


1186
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:50,346
>> So when you finish a drill,


1187
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:51,476
you can actually share your

>> But you know, Doug,


1192
00:45:57,886 --> 00:46:00,246
basketball is way more fun when


1193
00:46:00,246 --> 00:46:01,326
you play against someone else.


1194
00:46:01,656 --> 00:46:03,396
