00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:16,596
>> Hello and welcome to our


4
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,526
session on What's New in App


5
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:19,146
Store Connect.


6
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:21,556
My name is Tommy McGlynn and I'm


7
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:22,826
an App Store Connect Engineer.


8
00:00:24,116 --> 00:00:26,356
Today our focus is the App


9
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:26,946
Lifecycle.


10
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:28,906
This is everything from the


11
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:30,536
moment you first began creating


12
00:00:30,536 --> 00:00:32,555
an app to the moment you make it


13
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:36,006
available in the App Store.


14
00:00:36,206 --> 00:00:37,316
As we look at the lifecycle


15
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:38,496
today, we'll highlight some


16
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:39,696
things that are important to


17
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:42,016
know and we'll look at recent


18
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:43,746
improvements to specific phases


19
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:44,466
of the lifecycle.


20
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,166
And finally we'll look at some


21
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,356
brand new features that you


22
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:50,486
haven't seen yet.


23
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:52,086
So let's begin where it all


24
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:54,436
starts for every developer and


25
00:00:54,436 --> 00:00:55,576
that's where we design and


26
00:00:55,576 --> 00:00:57,416
develop apps in Xcode.


27
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:00,546
Xcode is where you create apps,


28
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:01,926
and we've just announced that


29
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:03,496
you can now deliver amazing


30
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,075
watch apps without needing to


31
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:07,366
build an iOS companion app.


32
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:10,796
And these apps will be fully


33
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:12,366
supported in App Store Connect


34
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:14,306
from TestFlight through to


35
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:16,246
through to the App Store and


36
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:19,896
customers can discover your app


37
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:21,526
right on their watch, in the new


38
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:23,266
App Store built specifically for


39
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:23,976
Apple Watch.


40
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:29,156
Now you've built an app in Xcode


41
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:30,256
and you're ready to share it


42
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:30,866
with the world.


43
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,246
The next step is to upload your


44
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:34,973
app.


45
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:38,666
A common way to deliver apps


46
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,756
today is within Xcode or with


47
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:43,506
Application Loader which is an


48
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:46,906
app that's installed with Xcode.


49
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:48,596
Beginning with the beta of Xcode


50
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:50,926
11, Application Loader will no


51
00:01:50,926 --> 00:01:51,826
longer be included.


52
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,616
Instead, we've created a new


53
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:56,106
dedicated experience for


54
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:57,956
delivering apps that does not


55
00:01:57,956 --> 00:01:59,546
require you to install Xcode.


56
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,146
It's called Transporter.


57
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,166
This is a dedicated Mac App


58
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:06,976
that's super easy to use and


59
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,166
it's a great way to deliver your


60
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:08,586
apps.


61
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:12,346
Transporter is also a localized


62
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:12,576
app.


63
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:14,436
So it's a great experience for


64
00:02:14,436 --> 00:02:16,306
anyone on your team across many


65
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:16,906
languages.


66
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,166
So let's take a closer look at


67
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,156
how to use Transporter.


68
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:24,476
First you sign in with your


69
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:25,106
Apple ID.


70
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,016
Then if you belong to multiple


71
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:29,636
teams, you'll choose one from


72
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:30,436
the drop-down list.


73
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,246
Now it's time to select the


74
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:35,536
files that you want to deliver.


75
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:38,166
Transporter uses a simple


76
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,366
drag-and-drop interface.


77
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:42,306
You just take your IPA that


78
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,186
you've exported from Xcode, drag


79
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:45,806
it over Transporter and drop.


80
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:48,656
From there it's a simple click


81
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:52,846
to begin verifying the package.


82
00:02:52,996 --> 00:02:54,116
Transporter will display


83
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:55,856
warnings and errors that occur


84
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:57,786
during validation so you can


85
00:02:57,786 --> 00:03:01,556
find and fix them early.


86
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,766
Once errors have been addressed


87
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:04,256
you can click to deliver the


88
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:04,686
package.


89
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:07,976
Transporter will display


90
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:10,156
delivery progress and you have


91
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,076
the option to cancel or restart


92
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:13,236
deliveries that have not yet


93
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:13,716
completed.


94
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:17,546
You also have the option to


95
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:19,516
verify many packages at the same


96
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:19,846
time.


97
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,366
Simply drag all of them into


98
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:24,146
Transporter and click to begin


99
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:24,756
validation.


100
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:27,196
That's transporter for Mac.


101
00:03:27,356 --> 00:03:28,796
It's really easy, and I know it


102
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:30,066
could be a great tool for your


103
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:30,746
team.


104
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:34,746
So once your app is uploaded, we


105
00:03:34,746 --> 00:03:37,886
do some further validations and


106
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,036
some issues can only be


107
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:40,656
diagnosed after we've received


108
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:41,016
your app.


109
00:03:42,326 --> 00:03:43,926
If we do find any issues, you'll


110
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:45,276
receive an email to let you


111
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:48,926
know, and we've recently made


112
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:50,036
some enhancements to these


113
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:50,926
emails.


114
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:53,346
First we added the version


115
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:54,526
number prominently in the


116
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,256
subject line.


117
00:03:57,636 --> 00:03:59,616
We also added additional context


118
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,016
to help you quickly understand


119
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:01,446
the problem.


120
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:05,126
And finally we added numeric


121
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:06,386
codes for each error.


122
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:08,406
These will help you find more


123
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:10,546
details on each error type.


124
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:14,066
We've also introduced a new way


125
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,386
to view your builds after


126
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:17,576
they've been uploaded with the


127
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:19,426
new Build Activity View in App


128
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,546
Store Connect for iOS, where you


129
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:24,016
can see all of the recent builds


130
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:26,126
that you've uploaded along with


131
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:27,716
detailed information about each


132
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:31,176
build as well as the download


133
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:32,766
and install sizes for each


134
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:33,356
device model.


135
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:37,476
In addition to Build Activity,


136
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:38,896
there's a new notification type


137
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:41,376
that you can enable called Build


138
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:42,296
Processing Changes.


139
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:45,056
This is a great way to be


140
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,566
notified immediately as your


141
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:47,736
builds finish processing.


142
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,786
Now you've delivered your app


143
00:04:52,786 --> 00:04:54,156
and you're moving from


144
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:55,776
development into the testing


145
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:56,116
phase.


146
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:58,466
The next step in the App


147
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,956
Lifecycle is TestFlight.


148
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:02,116
We've built some exciting new


149
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:03,836
features for TestFlight and to


150
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,046
tell you all about it I'd like


151
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:05,976
to invite Payam on stage.

153

Hi everyone.


154
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:16,136
My name Payam Yousefi,


155
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:16,916
and I'm an engineer


156
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,676
on App Store Connect.


157
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:19,706
I'm really excited to be here


158
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:21,136
today to tell you all about


159
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:23,156
what's new with TestFlight, but


160
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,296
first let's reflect a little


161
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:25,906
bit.


162
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:29,236
Last year we introduced Public


163
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:29,636
Links.


164
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,206
This made it so much easier for


165
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,026
you to invite lots of new people


166
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:34,966
to test their apps.


167
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:37,226
All you needed to do is create a


168
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,606
unique URL, you can share it


169
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,906
with anyone, anywhere all


170
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:42,746
without an email address.


171
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:45,996
One of the first adopters of


172
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:48,486
Public Links was Snapchat and


173
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:49,906
they had some great things to


174
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:50,286
say.


175
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,516
I'd like to read it to you now.


176
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,366
TestFlight Public Links reduce


177
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:56,646
friction for our testers.


178
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,716
It increased our tester pool in


179
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:00,586
a way that's lightweight and


180
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:02,766
easier to maintain while


181
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:03,896
providing us with more than


182
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,076
twice the amount of useful


183
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:06,056
pre-release feedback.


184
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:08,036
It's that awesome?


185
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:10,566
And we've been working harder to


186
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:12,336
reduce friction for testers even


187
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:12,756
more.


188
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:16,306
This year we improved the


189
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:18,386
TestFlight app by localizing it


190
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:19,786
in dozens of additional


191
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:20,166
language.


192
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,636
That means that it's even more


193
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:25,596
effortless for testers worldwide


194
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:27,516
to start testing their apps.


195
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:28,966
And now that you have lots of


196
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:30,536
new testers, you're probably


197
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:33,086
eager to hear from them.


198
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:35,296
We know how important it is for


199
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:36,636
you to learn about new bugs and


200
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,576
crashes as soon as they happen


201
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:41,076
during the testing phase, and we


202
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:42,126
know that sometimes you don't


203
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:43,276
always get all the detail you


204
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:44,746
need from your testers when they


205
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:45,636
send you issues.


206
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,266
So today I'm really excited to


207
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:49,776
announce something completely


208
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,846
new for TestFlight.


209
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:52,826
We've printed features that will


210
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:53,906
improve the beta testing


211
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:56,146
experience, and we call it


212
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:57,976
TestFlight Feedback.


213
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:02,556
[ Applause ]


214
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,206
Yeah, these are some great


215
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:05,856
enhancements that help increase


216
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:07,456
the quality and quantity of


217
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:08,916
feedback you receive from your


218
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:09,796
beta testers.


219
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:12,976
So now when testers first start


220
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:14,656
testing your app, they're see a


221
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:16,486
new onboarding experience that


222
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:17,986
helps them get up to speed on


223
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:19,396
what to test and how to start


224
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:20,486
sending you feedback.


225
00:07:21,486 --> 00:07:23,476
Now there's two new ways to


226
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,416
start sending feedback.


227
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:27,276
First, testers can send


228
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:29,476
screenshots to you without ever


229
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:31,126
leaving your app.


230
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,386
And second, testers are prompted


231
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:36,556
any time a crash occurs so they


232
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,796
can quickly send you feedback


233
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,126
about that crash.


234
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,356
And we'll also go over new


235
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:43,476
sections in App Store Connect


236
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,826
that let you manage all the


237
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:46,186
feedback you collect through


238
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:48,836
Test Flight, but first let's


239
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,576
take a closer look at how


240
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:52,306
testers can send you feedback in


241
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:53,976
a demo on my iPhone.


242
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,736
So, my team invited me to test a


243
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:03,996
beta version of their app called


244
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:05,086
Forest Explorer.


245
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,126
It's still early in development


246
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:08,726
and so there's lots for me to


247
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:09,706
give feedback on.


248
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:13,876
Let's start testing it together.


249
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,406
Now when you launch that first


250
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:17,186
version of an app, you see this


251
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:18,626
new onboarding screen.


252
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:20,536
It tells you everything you need


253
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:22,266
to know to get started and all


254
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,666
you have to do is enter test


255
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,306
notes on the builds in App Store


256
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:27,086
Connect and it will display


257
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:27,446
here.


258
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:29,916
So here I can see that my team


259
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,226
wants me to be on the lookout


260
00:08:31,306 --> 00:08:32,736
for issues in layout and


261
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:33,436
usability.


262
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:35,666
Sounds good to me so I'll tap


263
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:36,645
next.


264
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:39,186
Here we see steps on how to


265
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,966
start giving feedback just by


266
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:42,066
taking a screenshot.


267
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:44,006
I'm excited to give it a try.


268
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:47,496
So let's start testing.


269
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:49,096
Here's Forest Explorer.


270
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:52,246
So you see my photo feed and


271
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:54,136
some trails on the feed, and


272
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,686
right off the bat I can see that


273
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:57,786
the Half Dome Trail, it's kind


274
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:59,296
of darker in text in comparison


275
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:00,186
to the other trails.


276
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:01,946
So this is a good opportunity


277
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:03,056
for me to send some feedback.


278
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:06,686
I'll take a screenshot, tap on


279
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:08,936
the preview, and here when you


280
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:11,226
tap done, there's a new Share


281
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:12,716
Beta Feedback Option.


282
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:14,576
This is available to all beta


283
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:16,106
apps that's feedback enabled.


284
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:19,586
Tap on that it opens up a


285
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:21,066
dialogue for me to enter more


286
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:21,906
information.


287
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:24,506
Because I'm a Public Link tester


288
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:25,756
I have the option to include an


289
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:27,446
email address with this piece of


290
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:29,696
feedback, but for now I'll just


291
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:30,476
add some comments.


292
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:33,926
The text should be more


293
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:37,166
consistent with the other trails


294
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:40,916
and I'll tap submit and that's


295
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:40,983
it.


296
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:42,636
I just sent some feedback.


297
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,576
[ Applause ]


298
00:09:47,076 --> 00:09:48,376
Thank you.


299
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:49,416
Let's keep looking around.


300
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,186
On a trail, I see some trails


301
00:09:52,186 --> 00:09:53,696
that I've saved on this app, and


302
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:56,626
I can see that the icons on the


303
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:57,886
lower left are kind of clipped


304
00:09:57,886 --> 00:09:58,706
off-screen.


305
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:00,966
So this might be a good place


306
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:01,756
for me to send some more


307
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:02,206
feedback.


308
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:05,116
I'll take a screenshot and while


309
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:06,586
I'm at it I'll take a second


310
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:09,066
screenshot too and that way I


311
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,556
can crop the first one, but


312
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:12,996
leave the second one intact for


313
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:13,386
context.


314
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:17,346
I'll even mark it up just to


315
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:18,486
point out where the issue is


316
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:21,056
happening, and I'll tap done and


317
00:10:21,056 --> 00:10:22,066
share beta feedback.


318
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,966
Again, I can include comments


319
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:27,416
about what the issue is, the


320
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,436
icons are clipped off-screen,


321
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:32,196
and I'll tap submit.


322
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:34,896
And that's it.


323
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:36,536
I've sent multiple screenshots.


324
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:36,976
Isn't that awesome?


325
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:41,696
[ Applause ]


326
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:42,756
Let's keep testing around.


327
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:44,246
I'll tap on nearby and see what


328
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:46,716
trails are around and let's find


329
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:49,456
a Half Dome Trail on the map.


330
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:50,786
Okay, Forest Explorer just


331
00:10:50,786 --> 00:10:52,676
crashed and this is a new


332
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:53,626
feature that's a part of


333
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,166
feedback.


334
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,396
Now when your beta apps crash,


335
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:58,076
testers are prompted to share


336
00:10:58,076 --> 00:10:59,786
feedback about the crash.


337
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:01,816
So I know my team will want to


338
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:03,266
know about this so I'll tap


339
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:05,946
share and here I can include


340
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:07,546
steps on what caused the crash.


341
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:09,996
Tapped on the Half Dome Trail


342
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:13,926
and the app crashed.


343
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:18,096
And that's it.


344
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:19,026
I've just sent some crash


345
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,556
feedback to my team and they'll


346
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,086
know where to start debugging


347
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,356
thanks to the feedback I sent.


348
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,926
So I think I'm done testing


349
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:28,616
Forest Explorer for now, but as


350
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:31,116
you can see, I've been able to


351
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:32,306
send a bunch of valuable


352
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:33,886
feedback in just a few minutes


353
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:34,946
of testing.


354
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:35,866
Isn't that exciting?


355
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:40,576
[ Applause ]


356
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:41,956
These are some really great


357
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:43,006
features and sending feedback


358
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:44,476
through TestFlight has never


359
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:46,676
been easier and as a developer,


360
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:47,886
you don't have to do any extra


361
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:50,046
work to get quality feedback


362
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:50,866
from your testers.


363
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:53,756
So finally, let's talk about


364
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:54,956
managing the feedback in App


365
00:11:54,956 --> 00:11:55,426
Store Connect.


366
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,126
You'll be able to view feedback


367
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,496
submissions shortly after you


368
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:01,426
receive them and you'll have


369
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:03,596
helpful filters where you can


370
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,346
find feedback that's important


371
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:06,976
to you.


372
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:08,316
Each feedback submission will


373
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:10,076
include details about the tester


374
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:12,626
and their device and each


375
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:13,606
feedback will be available to


376
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:15,176
download in a zip file.


377
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,836
And in cases where you want to


378
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,656
stop receiving feedback, you can


379
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,496
disable it too.


380
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:21,976
So let's take a look at these in


381
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:22,616
more detail.


382
00:12:24,056 --> 00:12:25,426
To manage your crash feedback


383
00:12:25,726 --> 00:12:27,186
just select the Crashes tab in


384
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:29,486
TestFlight and from here you'll


385
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:31,766
view detailed information about


386
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:33,116
all the crashes you've received


387
00:12:33,116 --> 00:12:33,916
from your testers.


388
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,636
You can filter crashes by things


389
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,486
like App Version, Build Version


390
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:40,306
or Device Model to help find


391
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:41,606
specific crashes you're looking


392
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:44,596
for, and each piece of feedback


393
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:46,646
contains useful details about


394
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,456
the tester and their device at


395
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:49,726
the time of the crash.


396
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,056
So you'll find things like


397
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:53,686
connection type and free disk


398
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:55,236
space available or even the


399
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:57,296
battery life of the device when


400
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:58,336
the app crashed.


401
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:00,096
And if you need to share


402
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:01,796
feedback with members of your


403
00:13:01,796 --> 00:13:03,076
team outside of App Store


404
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,466
Connect, you can download a zip


405
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:07,766
file too and it'll include


406
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:09,416
everything you see plus the


407
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,896
crash log when the crash


408
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:11,456
happened.


409
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:13,686
Now it's even easier for you to


410
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:14,926
track down what caused your app


411
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:15,586
to crash.


412
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:18,576
So what about the screenshots


413
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:20,166
that your testers send you?


414
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:22,436
Those live in the Screenshots


415
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:23,476
Tab in TestFlight.


416
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:26,346
You'll be able to find a gallery


417
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:28,926
of screenshots feedback that


418
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,086
your testers have submitted.


419
00:13:31,336 --> 00:13:32,746
Just like in crashes you can


420
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,466
filter screenshots by some


421
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:35,466
helpful filters.


422
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:37,526
For example, you may want to


423
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,826
look for some feedback from


424
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:40,436
testers using different devices


425
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:41,576
than the ones you normally build


426
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:41,886
with.


427
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:45,166
So you can select the device


428
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:47,226
like the iPhone SE, for example.


429
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:50,066
And now filtered you can


430
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,096
discover any issues on smaller


431
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:52,596
screens.


432
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:54,166
So here we see a couple of


433
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,406
screenshots testers have sent


434
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:56,746
about Forest Explorer.


435
00:13:57,846 --> 00:13:58,966
Let's take a look at one more


436
00:13:58,966 --> 00:13:59,556
detail.


437
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:02,466
This tester is reporting a major


438
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,156
layout issue similar to the one


439
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:05,086
we saw earlier.


440
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:09,156
Screenshot feedbacks contain the


441
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:10,776
same helpful details that you'll


442
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:11,926
find in crash feedback.


443
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:13,896
So you'll find things like


444
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,946
screen resolution, device model


445
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:18,026
or iOS version of the device.


446
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:20,046
So paired with screenshots


447
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:21,486
you'll be able to better


448
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,056
troubleshoot the testers


449
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:23,506
feedback.


450
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:26,816
You can also download a zip file


451
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,586
too and it'll include all the


452
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:29,516
screenshots you see in


453
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:32,196
TestFlight plus the details that


454
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:33,156
are in App Store Connect.


455
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:37,636
If at any point you want to stop


456
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:39,636
collecting feedback, you can


457
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:41,306
disable it at the tester group


458
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:41,756
level.


459
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,976
This means that your testers


460
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:45,396
will no longer see the


461
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:47,406
onboarding screen or be able to


462
00:14:47,406 --> 00:14:49,026
send you feedback from directly


463
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:50,606
within your app, but you can


464
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:52,146
re-enable this at any time.


465
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:55,266
So these are some of the ways


466
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:57,026
you can manage feedback that you


467
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:58,696
receive through TestFlight and


468
00:14:58,696 --> 00:14:59,296
App Store Connect.


469
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,526
With all these improvements,


470
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,546
you'll be able to receive more


471
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:05,446
effective feedback at any point


472
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,506
during the testing phase and


473
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,666
testers can start sending you


474
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,356
feedback today.


475
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:13,106
Anyone running iOS 13 will be


476
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:14,416
able to use all of these new


477
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,546
features in TestFlight.


478
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:18,686
We're really excited about


479
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:21,206
TestFlight feedback, and we want


480
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:22,976
to start receiving feedback from


481
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:23,516
you too.


482
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:26,766
So today we're announcing the


483
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,476
TestFlight Beta Program.


484
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:30,486
This means that you can get


485
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:32,106
early versions of TestFlight for


486
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:34,256
iOS, test the latest features


487
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,666
and give us feedback.


488
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:38,036
You can sign up for the beta on


489
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:39,876
a Developer Downloads Page.


490
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:41,776
We're excited to receive


491
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:43,306
feedback and help improve


492
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:44,656
TestFlight even more.


493
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:46,626
Thank you so much, and I'll give


494
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:47,676
the stage back to Tommy.


495
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:54,556
[ Applause ]


496
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:55,886
Thanks, Payam.


497
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,456
Those are great new ways to


498
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,116
receive feedback about your beta


499
00:15:59,116 --> 00:15:59,496
apps.


500
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:01,756
After you've received feedback


501
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,306
and you've iterated on your app,


502
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:05,456
it's time to transition to the


503
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:08,056
App Store, but first something


504
00:16:08,056 --> 00:16:09,956
you'll likely think about is how


505
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:10,686
to price your app.


506
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:13,646
The App Store enables you to


507
00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:16,156
generate sales globally to


508
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:18,556
millions of customers in 155


509
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:19,266
territories.


510
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:22,076
We ensure that you can do


511
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:23,736
business with as many customers


512
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:25,876
as possible by consistently


513
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,256
adding support for new payment


514
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:29,716
methods so customers can pay for


515
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:31,156
your app in whichever method


516
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:31,686
they prefer.


517
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:34,796
And with new support for the


518
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:36,696
Korean won, you can now generate


519
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,706
sales across 45 unique


520
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,316
currencies.


521
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:42,446
Although you can generate sales


522
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:44,246
across all currencies, your


523
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:45,326
business doesn't need to handle


524
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:48,326
payment for all them because we


525
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:50,106
consolidate all of your proceeds


526
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:51,736
into a single payment to your


527
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:52,306
bank account.


528
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:55,106
For those of you who offer


529
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:57,746
subscriptions you have 200


530
00:16:57,746 --> 00:16:58,936
different price tiers to choose


531
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:02,016
from, and we recently released a


532
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:03,436
feature called Subscription


533
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:03,986
Offers.


534
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:06,915
These allow you to offer a


535
00:17:06,915 --> 00:17:08,746
discount or free period of


536
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:11,996
service for subscriptions and


537
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:13,636
you decide which subscribers


538
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:14,846
qualify for the offer.


539
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:18,336
This is a great way to retain


540
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:21,406
existing subscribers or to win


541
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:22,935
back previous subscribers.


542
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:30,026
There's a lot of great ways to


543
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:31,576
utilize subscriptions, but I


544
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:32,726
won't go into detail here


545
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,106
because we have two sessions on


546
00:17:34,106 --> 00:17:35,396
this tomorrow, and I encourage


547
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:39,206
you to check these out.


548
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,546
Now you've nailed down the


549
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:42,216
pricing strategy and next


550
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,236
there's something equally


551
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:45,456
important to think about and


552
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:46,286
that's how your app is


553
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:47,696
represented in the App Store


554
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,106
Product Page.


555
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:51,946
This involves app naming,


556
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:54,786
description and keywords which


557
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:56,396
make it easier for customers to


558
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:59,246
discover your app and when it


559
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,856
comes to reaching as many people


560
00:18:00,856 --> 00:18:03,036
as possible, a key aspect is


561
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:03,886
localization.


562
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:07,306
If we take English as an


563
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:09,456
example, only about 5% of the


564
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,486
world speaks English as a first


565
00:18:11,486 --> 00:18:11,886
language.


566
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:13,866
So when you localize your


567
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:15,246
product page there's a huge


568
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:16,776
opportunity to reach more


569
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:17,106
people.


570
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:20,746
We focus on supporting a lot of


571
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,336
languages, and we recently added


572
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,106
support for more.


573
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,626
To tell you more about these


574
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:26,186
languages and how you localize


575
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:27,596
your product page, I'd like to


576
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:28,486
invite Ethar [phonetic] on


577
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:28,906
stage.

00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:36,606
[ Applause ]


579
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:37,636
>> Thanks Tommy.


580
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:38,796
Salam everyone.


581
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:40,646
My name is Ethar Elsaka [assumed


582
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:42,476
spelling], and I'm an engineer


583
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:43,546
on App Store Connect.


584
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:46,436
Today we will talk about a very


585
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:48,066
exciting feature related to your


586
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:48,896
apps metadata.


587
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:51,686
We believe that localization is


588
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:54,586
the key aspect for making your


589
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:56,396
apps more accessible to the


590
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:57,266
global audience.


591
00:18:57,876 --> 00:18:59,866
We are always working hard to


592
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:01,696
introduce new language support


593
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:04,976
and just this past year we


594
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:06,876
introduced nine new languages


595
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:09,826
bringing the total number of


596
00:19:09,826 --> 00:19:12,276
languages supported by the App


597
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,976
Store to 37 languages.


598
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:19,646
[ Applause ]


599
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:22,286
Actually let me pause here and


600
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,106
give you a pop quiz.


601
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:27,086
Who knows what does aikhtibar


602
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:27,396
[phonetic] mean?


603
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,586
And what about tatbiq?


604
00:19:35,636 --> 00:19:37,606
So here is your first Arabic


605
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:38,036
lesson.


606
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:41,206
Aikhtibar means test and tatbiq


607
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:42,826
means app.


608
00:19:42,826 --> 00:19:44,436
If you wonder why I give you


609
00:19:44,436 --> 00:19:46,446
this Arabic quiz, this is


610
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,016
because Arabic is one of the


611
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:50,666
right to left languages and


612
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:53,076
today I'm very excited to share


613
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:55,346
that for the first time in the


614
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,706
App Store with iOS 13 we are


615
00:19:58,706 --> 00:19:59,966
supporting Arabic and Hebrew.


616
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:06,500
[ Applause ]


617
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:12,026
So now these customers can set


618
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:14,266
their iPhone language to Arabic


619
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:17,456
or Hebrew and enjoy browsing our


620
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:19,286
App Store content in their


621
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,316
preferred language.


622
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:24,496
As you can imagine, this is not


623
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:27,036
a small effort and it requires


624
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:29,316
a rethink of almost every


625
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:30,956
aspect of display and


626
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:33,126
interaction, UI layout,


627
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:35,936
navigation controls, animation


628
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:37,726
and editorial artwork.


629
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:42,766
We believe that the presence of


630
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:45,416
localized app and editorial


631
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,106
content will lead to a deeper


632
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:50,186
and more integrated experience


633
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:53,156
for hundreds of millions of


634
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:57,596
customers on iOS and Mac, from


635
00:20:57,596 --> 00:20:59,466
browse and purchase through App


636
00:20:59,466 --> 00:20:59,786
Launch.


637
00:21:02,236 --> 00:21:04,966
So to let these customers enjoy


638
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:07,426
our apps in their native


639
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:10,726
language, we need to localize


640
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:12,286
ours apps in App Store Connect


641
00:21:13,676 --> 00:21:15,466
and now let me show you how we


642
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:16,000
can do that.


643
00:21:21,616 --> 00:21:24,336
Once I'm at the home page, I


644
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:26,156
will click on my apps, which


645
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:27,836
contains all the apps under the


646
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:30,226
Nature Lab team.


647
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,916
I choose to localize the first


648
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,136
Explorer App to make it easier


649
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:39,526
for my friends and family in


650
00:21:39,526 --> 00:21:40,346
Egypt to use it.


651
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:43,416
I don't know where because we


652
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,836
don't have forest in Egypt but


653
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:45,976
maybe when they come visit.


654
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:49,606
[ Laughter ]


655
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:51,796
Now I need to select the version


656
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:53,676
that I want to localize and


657
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:56,426
since this app has never been


658
00:21:56,426 --> 00:21:58,276
released it has only one


659
00:21:58,276 --> 00:21:58,566
version.


660
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:02,146
Let me add Arabic language from


661
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:04,906
the drop-down menu on the right


662
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:08,996
and now I'm ready to localize my


663
00:22:09,736 --> 00:22:09,806
app.


664
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:15,256
I will need the promotional text


665
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:20,106
and since right to left is new


666
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,336
in the App Store Connect, I will


667
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:23,896
give the first Explorer for the


668
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:26,896
Arab people for one year for


669
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:27,156
free.


670
00:22:28,696 --> 00:22:31,256
I also need the description


671
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:34,416
which has detailed information


672
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,096
about the Forest Explorer


673
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:39,336
functionalities and features.


674
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:41,716
I also need to add meaningful


675
00:22:42,476 --> 00:22:45,726
keywords to make my app more


676
00:22:45,726 --> 00:22:46,256
discovered.


677
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:50,666
I can save for now, but I still


678
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,976
need to add the screenshots and


679
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:58,056
the support URL to be able to


680
00:22:58,056 --> 00:22:59,466
submit my app for review.

Now let me show you how the


682
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:05,696
Forest Explorer will look in the

00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,886
Here is how the Forest Explorer


685
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:11,576
will look in the App Store after


686
00:23:11,576 --> 00:23:12,266
releasing it.


687
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:13,376

TestFlight is available in


691
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:28,256
Arabic and Hebrew, which I


692
00:23:28,346 --> 00:23:30,156
believe would provide a good


693
00:23:30,156 --> 00:23:32,606
experience for Arabic and Hebrew

696
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,386
To summarize, we believe that


697
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:43,336
localization is important to


698
00:23:43,336 --> 00:23:44,936

>> Thank you, Ethar.


715
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:28,936
Localizing your product page is


716
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:30,136
a great way to improve


717
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,416
discoverability and now you can


718
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,076
do that for more languages than


719
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:34,686
ever before.


720
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:38,366
Now you've built and iterated on


721
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:40,076
your app, you've set a pricing


722
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:42,066
strategy and you've localized


723
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:42,826
your product page.


724
00:24:44,036 --> 00:24:45,786
The final step is submitting for


725
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:46,156
review.


726
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:48,716
To make sure that goes as smooth


727
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:50,056
as possible we have some


728
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:52,086
guidelines to keep in mind.


729
00:24:53,096 --> 00:24:54,966
The first one, of course, is


730
00:24:55,086 --> 00:24:56,826
please test your app on a device


731
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:58,346
before submitting it.


732
00:24:59,176 --> 00:25:01,066
Ensure you fill out all app


733
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,466
information and metadata.


734
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:06,086
Keep your contact info up to


735
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:08,046
date so we can reach you if


736
00:25:08,046 --> 00:25:08,896
there are any issues.


737
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:12,116
And if your app requires a


738
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:13,896
login, well, that's something


739
00:25:13,896 --> 00:25:15,056
we're going to need in order to


740
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:15,796
review your app.


741
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:18,166
So, please add credentials for a


742
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:18,756
demo account to the review


743
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:18,906

744
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:19,746
Also explain any non-obvious


745
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:20,556
features and in-app purchases in


746
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:20,976
the review notes.


747
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:24,846
I also want to share some


748
00:25:24,946 --> 00:25:26,936
frequent feedback that we give


749
00:25:28,806 --> 00:25:35,496
developers during app review.


750
00:25:35,646 --> 00:25:37,496
Provide accurate screenshots


751
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,076
that show your app in use and


752
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:42,046
make sure the UI corresponds to


753
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:43,826
the correct device type.


754
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:48,686
Only ask for login credentials


755
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:50,316
when it's necessary to core


756
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:50,986
functionality.


757
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:53,556
Apps cannot require personal


758
00:25:53,556 --> 00:25:57,826
info in order to function.


759
00:25:57,896 --> 00:25:59,416
When requesting access to user


760
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:00,976
data, you need to provide


761
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,786
purpose strings that clearly


762
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:04,646
describe how your app will use


763
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:06,986
the data.


764
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:08,406
Finally, if you offer


765
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:09,846
subscriptions, make sure they're


766
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:11,386
straight forward and very easy


767
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:12,046
to understand.


768
00:26:12,686 --> 00:26:16,006
Now that your app has been


769
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:17,926
reviewed you're ready for the


770
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:21,136
App Store and after your app has


771
00:26:21,136 --> 00:26:22,326
spent some time on the store,


772
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,166
you'll start to receive customer


773
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,436
ratings and reviews.


774
00:26:26,006 --> 00:26:29,266
A great way to see and respond


775
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:30,696
to reviews is with App Store


776
00:26:30,696 --> 00:26:32,056
Connect for iOS.


777
00:26:32,596 --> 00:26:35,056
You can also enable


778
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:36,376
notifications for customer


779
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:37,976
reviews so you can see


780
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,046
immediately when your app


781
00:26:39,046 --> 00:26:40,296
receives a new review.


782
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:44,416
It's also important to mention


783
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,346
that App Store Connect for iOS


784
00:26:46,556 --> 00:26:48,786
is now a localized app with


785
00:26:48,786 --> 00:26:51,936
support for 14 languages so you


786
00:26:51,936 --> 00:26:53,646
can see that localization is an


787
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,336
important area of focus for all


788
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:57,026
the tools available to you and


789
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:57,986
your team.


790
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:02,486
In addition to customer reviews,


791
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:04,026
you have another important tool


792
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:05,636
that can help you decide where


793
00:27:05,636 --> 00:27:06,466
to place your development


794
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:09,216
efforts and that's analytics.


795
00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:12,396
With App Analytics you get a


796
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:13,956
wealth of information into how


797
00:27:13,956 --> 00:27:15,966
your app is performing on the


798
00:27:16,506 --> 00:27:17,786
App Store.


799
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:19,576
We recently added support for a


800
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:21,636
new platform and that's Mac OS.


801
00:27:21,636 --> 00:27:24,736
So you can access powerful


802
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:26,126
insight into how your app


803
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:27,776
performs on the Mac App Store.


804
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:32,196
Some of the metrics available


805
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:33,386
for Mac will include


806
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:35,346
Impressions, which is the number


807
00:27:35,346 --> 00:27:36,876
of times your app icon has been


808
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:37,576
viewed in the store.


809
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:41,116
Product Page Views is the number


810
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:42,266
of times your product page has


811
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,306
been viewed.


812
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:46,076
App Units shows how many times


813
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:47,256
your app was downloaded from the


814
00:27:47,256 --> 00:27:47,566
store.


815
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:52,246
And Sales will capture the total


816
00:27:52,246 --> 00:27:54,426
amount billed through purchases


817
00:27:54,426 --> 00:27:55,596
and in-app purchases.


818
00:27:57,836 --> 00:27:59,546
We're also introducing a


819
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:01,496
completely new metric for iOS


820
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:04,086
Apps called App Deletions.


821
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:06,866
this will allow you to see the


822
00:28:06,866 --> 00:28:08,356
number of times your app is


823
00:28:08,356 --> 00:28:09,916
uninstalled from customer's


824
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:10,426
devices.


825
00:28:10,996 --> 00:28:14,286
You might use this to correlate


826
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:16,636
deletions with an issue in a


827
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:19,586
recent version of your app.


828
00:28:19,856 --> 00:28:21,706
Or another interesting view is


829
00:28:21,706 --> 00:28:23,886
Deletions by Source Type which


830
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:25,526
shows if a given source is


831
00:28:25,526 --> 00:28:27,136
better able to retain customers


832
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:29,856
or what source is resulting in


833
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:30,746
the most deletions.


834
00:28:33,616 --> 00:28:35,036
There's one more exciting


835
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:37,206
announcement about Sales Data.


836
00:28:37,856 --> 00:28:39,776
This is an entirely new time


837
00:28:39,776 --> 00:28:41,716
range and level of granularity


838
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:45,176
for your sales data, the 24-Hour


839
00:28:45,176 --> 00:28:45,746
Dashboard.


840
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:49,416
This gives you an hour by hour


841
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,576
view into the last 24 hours of


842
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:52,526
sales performance.


843
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:55,176
[ Applause ]


844
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:55,736
That's right.


845

[ Applause ]


846
00:28:58,256 --> 00:28:59,766
You no longer have to wait until


847
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:01,346
the next business day to view


848
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:02,026
your sales data.


849
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:04,096
Let's take a look at the new


850
00:29:04,096 --> 00:29:04,596
dashboard.


851
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:08,046
Here we're looking at a sales


852
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,366
overview within Sales and


853
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:11,296
Trends, and we see sales data


854
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,126
for the last 7 days.


855
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,516
If you filter this view, you can


856
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:17,156
narrow it down to a handful of


857
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,756
specific in-app purchases.


858
00:29:19,446 --> 00:29:20,876
At the bottom of the list we see


859
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:22,526
a new in-app purchase that is


860
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:23,276
just released today.


861
00:29:23,276 --> 00:29:26,336
You see that it doesn't have any


862
00:29:26,336 --> 00:29:27,156
sales data yet.


863
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:29,856
This is one case where you'll


864
00:29:29,856 --> 00:29:31,226
want to use the 24-Hour


865
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:31,746
Dashboard.


866
00:29:32,286 --> 00:29:34,936
So if you click on the calendar


867
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:36,946
picker, you see a new option for


868
00:29:36,946 --> 00:29:38,036
Last 24 Hours.


869
00:29:39,086 --> 00:29:39,876
That will take you to the


870
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:43,026
24-Hour Graph.


871
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:45,006
Now you can see sales data on an


872
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:46,916
hourly basis and you can track


873
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,406
the success of your brand new


874
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:50,186
in-app purchase as it rolls out


875
00:29:50,186 --> 00:29:50,916
to customers.


876
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:53,486
You can see how this is a


877
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:55,066
powerful new way to view your


878
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:55,726
sales data.


879
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:00,056
Within the App Lifecycle that


880
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:02,836
brings us back to Xcode where we


881
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:03,896
can take everything we've


882
00:30:03,896 --> 00:30:05,296
learned so far and continue


883
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:07,296
creating great apps.


884
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:10,766
We have some labs tomorrow at 9


885
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:12,876
and 3, where you can come ask us


886
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:14,216
questions about anything we've


887
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:15,386
talked about.


888
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:18,296
As always, I can't wait to see


889
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:19,386
what you do with these new


890
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:20,176
capabilities.


891
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:21,846
I hope all of you enjoy the rest


892
00:30:21,846 --> 00:30:23,646
of your time here at WWDC.


893
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:24,786
Thank you.
