[ Applause and Cheering ]


3
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:18,706
>> Hello. My name is Ashley


4
00:00:18,706 --> 00:00:20,346
Carroll, and I'm a consulting


5
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:21,796
engineer from New York focused


6
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:22,626
on app development.


7
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:24,926
I spend my time working with our


8
00:00:24,926 --> 00:00:26,556
largest business, government,


9
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:28,306
and education customers, helping


10
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:30,536
them build and distribute great


11
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:31,536
apps for their employees.


12
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,336
Welcome to App Distribution From


13
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:35,206
Ad Hoc to Eenterprise.


14
00:00:35,906 --> 00:00:37,326
So who here in the room today


15
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:38,576
has had to distribute an app


16
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:39,046
before?


17
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,556
Just a few hands, right.


18
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:42,736
You're in the right place.


19
00:00:42,736 --> 00:00:44,116
So, pretty much everyone has had


20
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:46,056
to do this, and whether you're


21
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:48,106
building apps for the App Store


22
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:50,036
or focusing on building


23
00:00:50,036 --> 00:00:52,116
customized private apps for


24
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:53,576
business or enterprise, you


25
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:54,466
should learn something today.


26
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:57,686
I want to begin by taking a step


27
00:00:57,736 --> 00:00:59,106
back from app distribution and


28
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:00,866
talk about the life cycle of an


29
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:01,836
app from its earliest


30
00:01:01,836 --> 00:01:02,456
beginnings.


31
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:04,355
Most of us probably know this


32
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:06,146
part of the process inside and


33
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:06,316
out.


34
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,326
It all starts with an idea for a


35
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:09,506
problem that you want to solve.


36
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:11,406
You figure out what to build.


37
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,236
You create a great app, and it


38
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:14,356
makes it into the hands of your


39
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:17,106
users, most often through the


40
00:01:17,706 --> 00:01:18,496
App Store.


41
00:01:18,726 --> 00:01:20,606
Today, we'll be focusing on that


42
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:23,156
last bit, how users actually get


43
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:25,106
your app onto their devices.


44
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:28,296
It seems simple, and for lots of


45
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,826
apps on the store, it is.


46
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:31,486
But there's actually a number of


47
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:32,606
different ways that you can


48
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:33,986
distribute an app.


49
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:36,506
And that depends on who your


50
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:37,866
customer is.


51
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:40,556
This is all about finding the


52
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:42,186
right way to reach your users.


53
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:43,886
Your users could be the general


54
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:45,756
public or business and education


55
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:46,286
customers.


56
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:48,036
Depending on who your app is


57
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:49,786
for, there are different ways to


58
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:50,396
distribute it.


59
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:52,426
There are four distribution


60
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:53,136
methods that we're going to


61
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:53,526
cover today.


62
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:57,756
Ad hoc, App Store, in-house, and


63
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:58,356
custom apps.


64
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:00,386
How do you determine which path


65
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:02,626
is the most appropriate for you?


66
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:05,206
This depends on a number of


67
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:07,186
factors, and some questions you


68
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:09,136
might ask along the way include


69
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:10,866
who's the audience for this app.


70
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:13,436
Who's going to maintain the


71
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:13,976
source code?


72
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:16,156
Are you building the app for you


73
00:02:16,156 --> 00:02:17,176
or for someone else?


74
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:19,076
Is someone buying this app for


75
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:20,256
their employees or students to


76
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:20,566
use?


77
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:23,536
All of this comes down to asking


78
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:25,626
who, and we can focus that on


79
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:27,446
who was using the app and who is


80
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:27,936
buying the app.


81
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:33,876
Knowing that the customer and


82
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:35,496
the user are not always the same


83
00:02:35,496 --> 00:02:37,296
person or entity is critical to


84
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:38,756
mastering the different ways


85
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:40,086
that apps can be distributed and


86
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:41,456
figuring out where your app


87
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,006
fits.


88
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:43,886
If you can identify your


89
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:45,386
audience, it becomes a lot


90
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:46,636
easier to pick the right


91
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:47,786
distribution mechanism.


92
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:50,176
Most often, an individual is the


93
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:51,606
both the customer and the user.


94
00:02:52,226 --> 00:02:53,256
They download your app from the


95
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,006
App Store on their own device


96
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:56,066
and then use it themselves.


97
00:02:57,256 --> 00:02:58,696
Ad hoc distribution lets you


98
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:00,226
distribute to a limited number


99
00:03:00,626 --> 00:03:02,586
of devices that you choose for


100
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:04,726
testing, and the App Store lets


101
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,676
you distribute apps to the


102
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:06,436
general public.


103
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,646
Now, sometimes when dealing with


104
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:10,816
the business and education


105
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,186
market, the customer is actually


106
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:14,876
an organization, and they're


107
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,706
purchasing apps on behalf of a


108
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:18,646
group of users who will use


109
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,346
those apps on either devices


110
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:21,936
that that organization provides


111
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:24,216
to them or on their own devices.


112
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:28,576
So there are two different ways


113
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:29,916
that you can distribute apps in


114
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,366
this scenario, in house and


115
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:33,256
custom apps, and those both let


116
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,926
you distribute apps privately to


117
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:36,626
organizations.


118
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:40,396
Your app might have different


119
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:41,746
reasons to use all of these


120
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:42,756
distribution methods at


121
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,436
different times in its lifetime


122
00:03:44,776 --> 00:03:46,156
or simply live in one of them,


123
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:47,736
and different distribution


124
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:49,466
mechanisms are associated with


125
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:51,316
different types of memberships


126
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:52,686
in the Apple developer programs.


127
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:55,686
We're going to walk through each


128
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:57,146
of these distribution methods


129
00:03:57,146 --> 00:03:57,476
today.


130
00:03:58,296 --> 00:04:00,466
The expectations around each and


131
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:01,886
everything that you need to know


132
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,246
to figure out where your app


133
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:05,936
fits.


134
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:07,416
We'll do this by following an


135
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,896
app on a distribution journey


136
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,716
from its very beginnings as a


137
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:12,136
prototype, through the App


138
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:13,906
Store, and through being


139
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,536
customized for a business to be


140
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:17,305
distributed privately in a few


141
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:17,995
different ways.


142
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:21,305
That app is LunchControl.


143
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:23,646
LunchControl is an app for


144
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:24,906
collaborative food ordering, and


145
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,396
when we're talking about


146
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,306
LunchControl, I want you to


147
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:30,076
imagine yourself as the


148
00:04:30,076 --> 00:04:30,926
developer for this app.


149
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:33,076
We'll begin with how


150
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:34,606
LunchControl came to be.


151
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:37,586
This whole journey starts with


152
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:38,686
ordering lunch at the office.


153
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:40,826
Everyone loves to get takeout,


154
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:43,156
but the process for ordering and


155
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:45,386
for a big group of people is


156
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,556
daunting and time consuming.


157
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:47,966
You have to figure out what


158
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,896
everyone wants to eat and go


159
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:50,826
through each of the orders to


160
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:52,386
make a consolidated list.


161
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:54,576
So, make sure you remember that


162
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:55,796
Trevor doesn't like tomatoes,


163
00:04:56,316 --> 00:04:58,016
whatever your boss' usual is,


164
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:00,816
and that the new guy, Rod was


165
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:02,726
it, said he wants a turkey club.


166
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,236
Does this sound familiar to


167
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:04,636
anyone?


168
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:06,936
It takes way too long, so it's


169
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:09,106
almost not worth ordering, and


170
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:10,166
it really sounds like a great


171
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,886
problem to solve with an app.


172
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:13,146
So you give it a try, and you


173
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,186
come up with a prototype.


174
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:16,796
To build your prototype, you've


175
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,546
downloaded Xcode, started


176
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:20,076
exploring the SDK, and you've


177
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:22,546
logged in using your Apple ID.


178
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:23,836
I'm sure most of you know how to


179
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:24,976
get started because you've


180
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:26,496
probably already published apps


181
00:05:26,546 --> 00:05:27,986
to the store, but we're going to


182
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:29,436
review this part of the process


183
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:31,626
quickly, just so that everyone's


184
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:32,896
on the same page, and you really


185
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:34,346
get a full picture of app


186
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:36,126
distribution from start to


187
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:37,386
finish, and hopefully you'll


188
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:39,416
learn something new along the


189
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:40,496
way.


190
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:41,556
This is your prototype.


191
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:43,456
You can select items from the


192
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:44,826
menu and create a group order.


193
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:47,246
All of the items are nicely


194
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,686
summarized, and it even breaks


195
00:05:48,686 --> 00:05:49,806
up the cost per person.


196
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:51,486
But how would you actually get


197
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:52,916
this prototype running on your


198
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:53,496
devices?


199
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,126
You can sign into Xcode with


200
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:57,776
your Apple ID and leverage the


201
00:05:57,776 --> 00:05:59,146
free account that comes with it,


202
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:00,566
called the Personal Team.


203
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:02,936
This enables you to explore the


204
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,366
SDK and test apps on your


205
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:04,926
device.


206
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:06,986
You can only deploy a limited


207
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:08,556
number of apps to a few devices,


208
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:10,476
and they expire after a few


209
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:12,326
days, so this isn't a real


210
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:14,006
distribution method.


211
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:16,946
Here's what you see in Xcode


212
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:17,856
once you're logged in with a


213
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:18,706
personal team.


214
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,656
You build and run your app.


215
00:06:20,656 --> 00:06:21,766
Xcode installs it on your


216
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,076
device, but in order for it to


217
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,666
be able to launch, you'll need


218
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,696
to trust your developer


219
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:27,136
certificate on your device.


220
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,526
This is what that process looks


221
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:29,786
like.


222
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:31,406
You can trust the developer


223
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:32,506
certificate by going into


224
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:35,166
settings, general, profiles, and


225
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,066
device management.


226
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:40,686
Here are a few best practices to


227
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:42,266
keep in mind for personal teams.


228
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:45,056
These accounts are really meant


229
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:45,686
for learning.


230
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:47,806
The assumption is that you're


231
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:50,626
going to be deploying to devices


232
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:53,206
that you own, and this isn't for


233
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:54,896
distribution beyond your own


234
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:55,546
devices.


235
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:58,266
Some capabilities like CloudKit,


236
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:00,796
Siri, or APNS aren't available,


237
00:07:01,276 --> 00:07:02,426
and there's no way to publish


238
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:03,456
apps to the store with this


239
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,416
program or debate a testing with


240
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,166
other users.


241
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:09,246
The goal for LunchControl is to


242
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:10,686
go beyond this learning stage.


243
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:12,906
So, let's talk about the first


244
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:13,996
way that you can distribute


245
00:07:13,996 --> 00:07:14,626
LunchControl.


246
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,096
Ad hoc distribution can be


247
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:18,526
utilized to distribute apps for


248
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:19,026
testing.


249
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:23,116
Up until this point, you've been


250
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:24,466
walking around to different


251
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:25,726
people's desks to take their


252
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:27,646
orders and mostly just testing


253
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:28,986
the app in the simulator and on


254
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:29,606
your own device.


255
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,406
You're really ready to have a


256
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:33,236
few friends try it out and get


257
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:34,216
feedback and see if you've got


258
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:36,286
something special, and you also


259
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:37,776
think that integrating with Siri


260
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:39,036
and push notifications would


261
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:40,466
make the experience even better,


262
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:43,106
which aren't available with


263
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:43,926
personal teams.


264
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,416
Membership in the Apple


265
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,076
Developer Program is required in


266
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,306
order to distribute an app to


267
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:49,666
others.


268
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:51,926
So, this is the point where if


269
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:53,726
you don't already have an


270
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:54,836
account, most developers would


271
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:56,736
sign up, either as a company or


272
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,726
an individual, and once you're


273
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:00,596
signed up, you're ready to start


274
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:04,286
distributing to others.


275
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:05,556
When you leverage ad hoc


276
00:08:05,556 --> 00:08:07,376
distribution, a limited number


277
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:08,736
of users can install your app


278
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,446
directly from their devices for


279
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:10,946
testing.


280
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:13,176
The process requires that you


281
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,676
register their device from the


282
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:16,326
developer website, and there are


283
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:17,626
a limited number of devices that


284
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:18,766
you can register for both


285
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:19,966
development and testing.


286
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:23,176
That's 100 devices per product


287
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,136
family per year.


288
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:27,396
For your average user,


289
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:29,396
registering a device involves


290
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:30,626
connecting it to a Mac and


291
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:32,126
getting the device identifier,


292
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:33,946
either from the finder's sidebar


293
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:35,936
or retrieving it from Xcode,


294
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,015
which means that you as a


295
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,236
developer would need physical


296
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:39,436
possession of their device.


297
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:42,806
You then take that identifier


298
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:43,956
and add it to the Apple


299
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,716
developer website, and once you


300
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:47,016
have their device registered,


301
00:08:47,496 --> 00:08:48,946
you're ready to create a build


302
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,176
and install it for them.


303
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:52,356
There are several different


304
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:53,756
alternatives for installing ad


305
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:54,866
hoc builds for testers.


306
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:56,616
You can tether the device to


307
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:58,656
your Mac and install with Xcode


308
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:00,286
or Apple configurator, which is


309
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:01,486
available on the Mac App Store,


310
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:03,166
or you can host the app


311
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,546
somewhere and enable


312
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:05,596
over-the-air installation.


313
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,216
This is a manual way of


314
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,026
achieving a limited distribution


315
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:11,036
to a small group.


316
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,646
This program is designed to let


317
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:17,356
you deploy to registered devices


318
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,446
for the purpose of testing.


319
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:21,216
It's not a long-term or scalable


320
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:23,126
distribution solution, and the


321
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,596
provisioning profiles used to


322
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,316
sign these apps expire yearly,


323
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:28,196
so eventually the apps will stop


324
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:30,066
working or need to be re-signed.


325
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:32,916
For larger teams, it's really


326
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:33,886
important to take note of the


327
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:34,586
device limits.


328
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:36,586
It can be hard to develop for


329
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:38,406
new products if you run out of


330
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:39,986
devices, which is why you have


331
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,096
to be careful when using


332
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:43,176
development devices for testers.


333
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,346
These device limits are reset


334
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:47,266
once per year, and if you're


335
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,716
curious about when your device


336
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:50,076
counts are going to be reset for


337
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:51,206
your account, you can go to the


338
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,296
member page on the developer


339
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:54,136
website and look at the reset


340
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:54,376
date.


341
00:09:54,896 --> 00:09:58,976
Ad hoc distribution gave us the


342
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:00,236
ability to test with a few


343
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:00,726
users.


344
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:03,446
You quickly realize that ad hoc


345
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:04,956
distribution isn't scalable as


346
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:05,986
the number of people who want to


347
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:07,096
test the app grows.


348
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:08,906
So, let's talk about the App


349
00:10:08,946 --> 00:10:09,216
Store.


350
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,426
The App Store offers a much


351
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:13,796
better way to do beta testing


352
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:15,016
for a large group of users.


353
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,436
User interest in LunchControl is


354
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:18,916
growing, and you want to expand


355
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,086
your audience to include more


356
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:20,706
testers.


357
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,566
TestFlight makes it really easy


358
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,146
for both developers and users to


359
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:28,526
try out apps, and installation


360
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:29,766
and updates are simple.


361
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:31,586
You could scale up to 10,000


362
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:32,046
testers.


363
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:33,946
The builds last for three


364
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:35,786
months, and for a user,


365
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,526
installing an app is a familiar


366
00:10:37,526 --> 00:10:38,516
and simple process.


367
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:40,956
TestFlight beta builds for


368
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:42,596
external testers do go through


369
00:10:42,596 --> 00:10:43,146
app review.


370
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:44,796
So, you need to make sure that


371
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:45,906
you're following the App Store


372
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:46,936
review guidelines before


373
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:48,656
submitting, and the app needs to


374
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:50,066
be stable and ready for a


375
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,046
broader audience to test.


376
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,276
However, if you're making a


377
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:55,016
build available to only members


378
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:56,546
of your App Store connect team,


379
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:58,406
review isn't required.


380
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:00,896
And TestFlight is only available


381
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:01,956
to members of the Apple


382
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:02,876
Developer Program.


383
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:06,726
TestFlight is built right into


384
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:07,486
App Store Connect.


385
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:09,506
For those of you who are only


386
00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:10,766
familiar with the Apple


387
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,576
Developer Enterprise Program and


388
00:11:12,576 --> 00:11:13,836
have probably never used App


389
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:15,396
Store Connect before, this is


390
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:16,016
what it looks like.


391
00:11:16,716 --> 00:11:18,446
App Store Connect enables you to


392
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:20,086
easily upload, submit, and


393
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:21,936
manage your apps on the App


394
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:22,286
Store.


395
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,166
All of your TestFlight builds


396
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,966
are available to see here, and


397
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:27,366
you can invite testers to test


398
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:28,736
your app.


399
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:29,846
Testers can install your app


400
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:31,456
from the TesFlight app on their


401
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,076
devices.


402
00:11:32,556 --> 00:11:35,606
Once you invite a tester in


403
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:37,086
TestFlight, they will receive an


404
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:38,596
email invitation to beta test


405
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:39,816
your app.


406
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:41,266
They can review all of the


407
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,786
testing details that you provide


408
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,506
and install the app to start


409
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:47,686
testing right away.


410
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:49,096
Once you're satisfied with the


411
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:50,686
stability of your built, the


412
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:52,516
next step is submitting to the


413
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:53,936
App Store.


414
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:55,886
For LunchControl, you've made


415
00:11:55,886 --> 00:11:57,696
some updates, added features


416
00:11:57,696 --> 00:11:59,016
based on feedback from your beta


417
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:00,836
testers, and really iterated on


418
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:01,376
your design.


419
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:03,156
You're ready to list the app for


420
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,906
sale, and you've even updated


421
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:08,536
your app icon.


422
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:10,236
You've done the hard work to get


423
00:12:10,236 --> 00:12:11,436
your app ready for submission.


424
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:14,546
Let's consider who the user and


425
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:15,686
who the customer is here.


426
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:17,946
Both are the general public,


427
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:19,656
which makes this app appropriate


428
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:21,076
for the public app store.


429
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:23,806
Any individual can download and


430
00:12:23,806 --> 00:12:25,446
use your app, and the person who


431
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:26,926
is buying it is also the person


432
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:28,106
who's using it.


433
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:30,956
Here are a few things you should


434
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:32,326
know about how App Store


435
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:33,266
distribution works.


436
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:35,876
Both individuals and


437
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:37,396
organizations can sign up for


438
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:38,886
the Apple Developer Program to


439
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:40,096
distribute to the App Store.


440
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:42,526
Apps are available to the


441
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:44,006
general public based on the


442
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:45,056
markets that you choose to


443
00:12:45,106 --> 00:12:47,216
support, and the apps are hosted


444
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,126
and reviewed by Apple.


445
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,356
This means that developers are


446
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,276
expected to know and follow the


447
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:55,846
App Store review guidelines.


448
00:12:56,746 --> 00:12:58,546
It's also expected that you keep


449
00:12:58,546 --> 00:12:58,866
current.


450
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:00,636
This means supporting new


451
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:02,216
hardware and screen sizes,


452
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:04,586
modern APIs, and new features,


453
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:05,766
like all of the exciting things


454
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:06,716
that we've announced this week.


455
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:10,056
And just to reiterate, the App


456
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,826
Store is appropriate for apps


457
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:13,496
that are for the general public,


458
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:14,816
which means that if you're


459
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:15,616
building an app for the


460
00:13:15,616 --> 00:13:17,846
employees of a specific company


461
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:19,936
to use, the public App Store is


462
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:21,356
probably not the most


463
00:13:21,356 --> 00:13:22,446
appropriate place for it.


464
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:25,036
Let's talk about a few more


465
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:26,636
scenarios that developers might


466
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:30,836
run into in the App Store.


467
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:32,676
First, let's talk about the


468
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:34,116
ability for a customer to


469
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:35,966
purchase your app in bulk for a


470
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:36,706
group of users.


471
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:38,656
There are programs in place that


472
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:41,186
enable you to do this.


473
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:42,916
For LunchControl, a bunch of


474
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:43,946
your friends are teachers at a


475
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:45,546
local school, and their school


476
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:47,056
wants to purchase the app in


477
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:48,466
bulk for all of the faculty to


478
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:48,856
use.


479
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,626
As a developer, if you want to


480
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:53,196
offer them a discount, you need


481
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:54,166
to make sure that this is


482
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,296
enabled in App Store Connect.


483
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:58,556
In this case, your user is still


484
00:13:58,556 --> 00:13:59,326
the general public.


485
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:00,716
So a group of teachers who would


486
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,416
be using your App Store app, but


487
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,586
the customer that's doing the


488
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:04,826
purchasing is actually the


489
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,106
school that they're working for.


490
00:14:07,436 --> 00:14:09,556
Customers use Apple Business


491
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:11,336
Manager or Apple School Manager


492
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:12,366
to purchase apps like


493
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:13,946
LunchControl from the App Store


494
00:14:13,946 --> 00:14:15,696
in bulk and distribute them to


495
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:16,276
their users.


496
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:20,006
To verify that an education


497
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:22,006
customer can purchase your app


498
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,596
at a discount, you would take a


499
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,526
look at the pricing and


500
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:25,986
availability section in App


501
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:26,546
Store Connect.


502
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:29,746
The default availability option


503
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:32,006
for an app is available at a


504
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:33,866
reduced price for educational


505
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:34,596
institutions.


506
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:36,866
If the educational institution


507
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:38,766
purchases 20 or more licenses,


508
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:40,106
and you have this enabled for


509
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:40,376
them.


510
00:14:40,706 --> 00:14:41,966
They'll receive a 50 percent


511
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:44,056
discount, and Apple School


512
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:45,716
Manager is required for them to


513
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:46,456
make this purchase.


514
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:53,526
Next, I want to discuss proper


515
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,316
versioning for an app and how to


516
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,606
handle adding additional


517
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,136
features.


518
00:14:58,556 --> 00:14:59,796
As LunchControl grows in


519
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:01,796
popularity, more and more


520
00:15:01,796 --> 00:15:03,616
feature requests are coming in,


521
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,016
and more organizations start to


522
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:07,066
become interested in leverage


523
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:07,326
the app.


524
00:15:08,546 --> 00:15:10,756
Some users or organizations may


525
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:12,786
ask you to add features that may


526
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,016
not make sense for your entire


527
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:16,226
audience, but you need to be


528
00:15:16,226 --> 00:15:17,426
careful about versioning your


529
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,866
app in the app store


530
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:19,596
appropriately.


531
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,016
As you start to expand your


532
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:23,446
customer base and consider


533
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:24,696
offering multiple versions of


534
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:26,416
your app on the store to various


535
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,506
clients or even variations of


536
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:30,766
your app for different types of


537
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:33,546
users, like if having an admin


538
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:34,836
and a regular version made sense


539
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,586
for you, you want to handle


540
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:37,866
versioning and your app store


541
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:38,906
presence appropriately.


542
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:42,216
This is what could happen if


543
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:43,386
LunchControl doesn't manage


544
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:44,256
their App Store presence


545
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:44,806
properly.


546
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:46,796
This is actually a real example


547
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:48,586
from the App Store, just using


548
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:50,096
the names from Liquid Oxygen


549
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:51,796
Company and LunchControl.


550
00:15:52,436 --> 00:15:53,356
Don't do this.


551
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:55,206
When a user searches the App


552
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:57,076
Store for a given name, this is


553
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:58,146
what they might see if you


554
00:15:58,146 --> 00:15:59,256
version your app this way.


555
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,196
They have no idea which app to


556
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:02,726
pick, and if they pick the wrong


557
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:04,146
one, they might not be able to


558
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:06,126
log in or use it and might not


559
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:07,496
behave in a way that's expected.


560
00:16:07,956 --> 00:16:09,156
This is a really frustrating


561
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:11,096
experience for a user, and it's


562
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:12,976
easily overcome by managing your


563
00:16:12,976 --> 00:16:14,876
versions better in software and


564
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,236
moving your customer base


565
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,596
forward as you make changes to


566
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:19,426
your app and your product.


567
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:21,316
What developers should do


568
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:23,036
instead is consolidate app


569
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,936
versions as much as possible.


570
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:27,666
Ideally, it's one app, just like


571
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,436
you see here on the left.


572
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:30,416
This does require more


573
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,066
development work, but in the end


574
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:33,196
it's a much better customer


575
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:35,816
experience, and if you as a


576
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:37,546
developer start getting requests


577
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,146
for lots of different customized


578
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:40,796
versions of your app, it might


579
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:42,436
be a good time to talk about how


580
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:43,776
you could deliver those versions


581
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:45,576
privately using custom apps,


582
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:47,436
which we'll get into in a few


583
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:47,806
minutes.


584
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:51,576
The final App Store scenario I


585
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:53,546
want to cover is building an App


586
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,246
Store app for someone else.


587
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:58,186
Your company, Liquid Oxygen,


588
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:00,396
LLC, might be approached by a


589
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:01,936
customer to build their own


590
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:02,676
public facing app.


591
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:04,996
In this case, we're going to


592
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:07,096
talk about Liquid Oxygen being


593
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:08,236
approached by a restaurant


594
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,406
chain, Taco Bar, to create their


595
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,756
App Store app for them.


596
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:15,346
Taco Bar loves what you've done


597
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:16,896
with LunchControl and really


598
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:17,876
wants you to build them an app


599
00:17:18,056 --> 00:17:19,195
where customers could place


600
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:20,925
orders, find the Taco Bar


601
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:23,366
locations near them, and pay for


602
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:23,786
their food.


603
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:25,675
They currently don't have an App


604
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:27,195
Store presence, so this would be


605
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:29,796
their flagship app, and you, as


606
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:31,096
a developer, don't want to give


607
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:32,386
Taco Bar your intellectual


608
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:32,906
property.


609
00:17:33,606 --> 00:17:35,676
In this scenario, the user of


610
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:37,176
your app is still the general


611
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:38,866
public, and the customer is


612
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:39,956
actually Taco Bar.


613
00:17:40,636 --> 00:17:41,916
You would be building an app for


614
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,996
Taco Bar for their customers


615
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:46,866
while still maintaining control


616
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,266
of your intellectual property


617
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:50,836
and running Liquid Oxygen, LLC.


618
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,146
This is a brand-new app that


619
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:54,926
will have a separate bundle ID


620
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:56,916
and will exist on the App Store


621
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,226
alongside LunchControl.


622
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:00,826
This is not simply publishing


623
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:02,356
the same app under a different


624
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:02,996
customer name.


625
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:04,316
It's a new and distinct


626
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:04,986
experience.


627
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:08,416
So, how would Liquid Oxygen work


628
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,026
with Taco Bar as a third-party


629
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:11,526
developer when building an App


630
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:12,416
Store app for them?


631
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:13,836
What's the best way for them to


632
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:14,526
work together?


633
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:18,226
Taco Bar is hiring Liquid Oxygen


634
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:19,666
to build an app and submit it to


635
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,286
the store under their developer


636
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:21,616
account.


637
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:24,186
The developer has to join Taco


638
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,616
Bar's developer program and


639
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:27,246
provide a build of the app for


640
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:29,076
Taco Bar to submit to the store.


641
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:30,866
This is what that workflow


642
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:31,506
should look like.


643
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:34,406
The two developer roles that


644
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:35,956
Taco Bar should assign to Liquid


645
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:38,866
Oxygen are Developer and


646
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:39,426
Marketing.


647
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:41,616
This would allow them to upload


648
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:43,186
bills and provide marketing


649
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:44,336
metadata like the app's


650
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:45,886
description and screen shots.


651
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:48,586
The admin role should remain


652
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,736
internal to Taco Bar.


653
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:53,156
This enables Taco Bar to control


654
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:54,606
TestFlight distribution,


655
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:57,556
pricing, submission, and go live


656
00:18:57,556 --> 00:18:58,266
on the App Store.


657
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:00,916
The app manager role should also


658
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:01,646
remain internal.


659
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,946
Here's what it looks like to add


660
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:06,456
and manage users in App Store


661
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:06,776
Connect.


662
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:09,366
Users with the admin and app


663
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:11,476
manager roles can create and


664
00:19:11,476 --> 00:19:13,546
edit users and also restrict a


665
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:15,936
user's access to specific apps


666
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:16,556
in the account.


667
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,256
Make sure to limit third-party


668
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:21,346
developer access to only those


669
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:22,546
apps that they're working on.


670
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:25,816
But note, user access cannot be


671
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,586
restricted to specific apps on


672
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:28,546
the developer site.


673
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:31,606
Users will have access to all of


674
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:33,396
the bundle IDs on the developer


675
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:33,656
site.


676
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,436
You can see here that Tracy is


677
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,286
the developer, and she has


678
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:40,456
access to the Taco Bar app only.


679
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:43,376
And if LunchControl and Liquid


680
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,996
Oxygen, LLC, were no longer to


681
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:47,396
have a relationship with Taco


682
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,766
Bar, the customer could always


683
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:50,036
remove them as a third-party


684
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:51,156
developer later on.


685
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:55,076
If you're developing an app for


686
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:57,606
a business, that business is the


687
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:59,246
only one allowed to submit to


688
00:19:59,246 --> 00:19:59,816
the App Store.


689
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,066
That means that apps must be


690
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:03,586
submitted under client accounts,


691
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:06,156
and customers of Taco Bar are


692
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:07,526
going to expect to be


693
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:09,166
downloading an app from Taco


694
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,976
Bar, Ltd., not from Liquid


695
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,246
Oxygen, LLC.


696
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,126
For more information on this,


697
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:15,356
you can review to App Store


698
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:17,956
review guidelines section 5.2.


699
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:20,796
Powerful roles like admin and


700
00:20:20,796 --> 00:20:22,206
app manager should be limited


701
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:24,396
for third-party developers, and


702
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:25,856
customers should also limit app


703
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:28,266
access to only the apps that


704
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:29,986
they'll be working on, and you


705
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:31,176
should also follow the best


706
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:32,456
practices for app versioning


707
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:33,236
that we discussed.


708
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:36,346
That concludes our discussion


709
00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:37,756
about the different scenarios


710
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:38,616
where you would distribute a


711
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:40,926
public-facing app through the


712
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:42,446
App Store.


713
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:43,506
For the remainder of the


714
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:45,106
session, we're going to talk


715
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:46,626
about two ways to distribute


716
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,426
apps that are customized for a


717
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:50,416
business, intended to be used


718
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:52,636
privately and internally by that


719
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:53,076
business.


720
00:20:53,746 --> 00:20:55,056
The first one we'll talk about


721
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:56,576
is in-house distribution.


722
00:20:57,646 --> 00:20:58,926
Let's check back in on


723
00:20:58,926 --> 00:20:59,536
LunchControl.


724
00:20:59,906 --> 00:21:02,636
Exciting things are happening,


725
00:21:02,706 --> 00:21:04,666
and Acme Company has approached


726
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,656
you to build them a custom


727
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,096
version of LunchControl for


728
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:09,416
their corporate cafeteria and


729
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,246
catering services so that their


730
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:12,606
employees can order food and


731
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,886
have the same great experience


732
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:14,736
that you offer in your app.


733
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:17,046
This would mean incorporating


734
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:18,236
their back-end system into the


735
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,216
app and building a totally


736
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:21,376
customized version for them.


737
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:24,776
In this case, Acme Company is


738
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:25,816
going to be the customer


739
00:21:26,216 --> 00:21:27,846
purchasing a custom app for a


740
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:29,576
group of users who happen to be


741
00:21:29,576 --> 00:21:30,366
their employees.


742
00:21:31,076 --> 00:21:32,856
We'll call it Acme Co. Café.


743
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:35,346
Knowing that the audience for


744
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:37,246
this app isn't public, it's the


745
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:38,866
employees of a company, it's


746
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:40,766
apparent that a public app store


747
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,026
isn't appropriate for this use


748
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:42,376
case.


749
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:44,626
When we think about apps for


750
00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:46,096
internal use, there are two


751
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,426
distribution methods that come


752
00:21:47,426 --> 00:21:50,076
to mind, in-house and custom


753
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:51,126
apps.


754
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:54,166
In a previous world, Acme


755
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,726
Company would probably have an


756
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:57,086
Apple Developer Enterprise


757
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:58,686
Program account and would


758
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:00,346
utilize in-house distribution to


759
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:00,956
deploy this app.


760
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:04,306
For a very long time, this was


761
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:05,526
the only way to do it.


762
00:22:06,456 --> 00:22:08,326
But recently, we've enabled the


763
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:09,986
ability for these types of apps


764
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:11,926
to be hosted on the App Store's


765
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:13,706
infrastructure via custom apps,


766
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:15,586
and there are a host of benefits


767
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:16,176
to doing so.


768
00:22:17,376 --> 00:22:18,476
While the Apple Developer


769
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:20,796
Enterprise Program still exists,


770
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:22,476
it's no longer the standard


771
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:23,856
mechanism for distributing


772
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:25,026
private internal apps.


773
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:27,176
There are some exceptions where


774
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:28,906
it still may be appropriate, but


775
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,256
for the vast majority of those


776
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:31,826
building private internal apps,


777
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:33,776
custom apps is going to be the


778
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:34,416
way forward.


779
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:38,516
In-house distribution, we'll


780
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:40,156
just cover it so that you know


781
00:22:40,156 --> 00:22:41,346
how it works if you do run into


782
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:41,516
it.


783
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:43,166
So, in-house distribution


784
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,836
enables you to control the


785
00:22:44,836 --> 00:22:47,056
entire distribution process and


786
00:22:47,056 --> 00:22:48,026
host the app yourself.


787
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:50,226
It requires membership into the


788
00:22:50,226 --> 00:22:51,376
Apple Developer Enterprise


789
00:22:51,456 --> 00:22:53,236
Program, but there are strict


790
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:54,696
eligibility requirements to get


791
00:22:54,696 --> 00:22:56,826
into that program, and it really


792
00:22:56,826 --> 00:22:58,276
is meant for those cases that


793
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,616
really can't be solved by custom


794
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:00,576
app distribution.


795
00:23:01,306 --> 00:23:02,696
Regions where Apple business


796
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:04,836
manager doesn't work, use cases


797
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:05,616
for state and federal


798
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:07,406
government, or use cases where


799
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:08,736
there are other intellectual


800
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:10,586
property issues could still


801
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:11,486
qualify for in-house


802
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:12,226
distribution.


803
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:15,386
Organizations utilizing in-house


804
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:17,336
distribution should own and


805
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:18,746
maintain the source code so that


806
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:20,016
they can do their own build to


807
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:20,976
maintain the project.


808
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:22,846
Distribution is handled


809
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:24,316
completely outside of the App


810
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:27,376
Store by the organization and is


811
00:23:27,376 --> 00:23:28,916
usually done by MDM.


812
00:23:29,816 --> 00:23:32,936
If you do find yourself in a


813
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:34,116
situation where you're leverage


814
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:35,766
in-house distribution, there are


815
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:36,806
a few things that you should be


816
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:37,306
aware of.


817
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:40,166
First and foremost, the apps


818
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,246
that you deploy using in-house


819
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:44,706
distribution must only go to


820
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:46,576
your employees and cannot be


821
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:47,736
made available to others.


822
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,226
Apps are signed by the


823
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:52,036
organization with a distribution


824
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:53,416
certificate, and that


825
00:23:53,596 --> 00:23:54,706
certificate needs to be


826
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:55,086
protected.


827
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:57,906
If it were to be compromised or


828
00:23:57,906 --> 00:23:59,806
revoked for any reason, all of


829
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,156
the apps that you deployed with


830
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:02,436
that certificate would stop


831
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:04,546
working immediately, and they


832
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:06,306
would need to be re-signed and


833
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:07,016
redeployed.


834
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,586
As you might imagine, that could


835
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:13,066
be catastrophic for a business.


836
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:14,666
Additionally, certificates will


837
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,036
expire every three years, and


838
00:24:16,476 --> 00:24:19,006
the provisioning profiles expire


839
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:19,506
annually.


840
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:20,756
So you need to manage that


841
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:22,506
certificate lifecycle and plan


842
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:23,826
for frequent releases of your


843
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:25,396
app that are aligned with it.


844
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:28,236
Beta testing and hosting of the


845
00:24:28,236 --> 00:24:29,656
apps needs to be handled by the


846
00:24:29,656 --> 00:24:31,596
organization and MDM, and


847
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:33,576
there's no TestFlight access for


848
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:34,306
enterprise accounts.


849
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:36,956
Apps are also going to need


850
00:24:36,986 --> 00:24:38,376
periodic access to the internet,


851
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:40,846
which makes it very difficult to


852
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,706
deploy apps in air gap networks.


853
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:46,696
Based on what we just talked


854
00:24:46,696 --> 00:24:48,506
about, in-house distribution


855
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:49,966
isn't going to be a good fit for


856
00:24:50,126 --> 00:24:50,316
Acme.


857
00:24:51,506 --> 00:24:53,466
Let's move onto Custom Apps.


858
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:54,826
This is the new way forward.


859
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:58,006
This scenario could work one of


860
00:24:58,076 --> 00:24:58,496
two ways.


861
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:01,316
The developer could simply offer


862
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:02,536
the app for sale to them via


863
00:25:02,756 --> 00:25:04,616
Custom Apps under their own


864
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:06,086
account, which would protect


865
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:07,326
their intellectual property.


866
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:09,176
This could be described as


867
00:25:09,226 --> 00:25:10,286
business to business, and this


868
00:25:10,286 --> 00:25:11,336
is actually the way that Custom


869
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,136
Apps used to work.


870
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:14,546
Alternatively, the developer


871
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,726
could negotiate with Acme


872
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:16,876
Company and provide them source


873
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:18,436
code, and they would handle the


874
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:19,516
submission of the Custom App


875
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:21,606
themselves under their own Acme


876
00:25:21,606 --> 00:25:23,386
account, which we could describe


877
00:25:23,386 --> 00:25:24,406
as business to self.


878
00:25:25,336 --> 00:25:26,996
Either way, Custom Apps is the


879
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:27,756
right solution.


880
00:25:28,336 --> 00:25:31,386
How does Custom App distribution


881
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:31,646
work?


882
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:34,326
Custom Apps are part of the


883
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,046
Apple Developer Program and are


884
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:38,196
hosted by Apple in Apple


885
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:39,026
Business Manager.


886
00:25:40,146 --> 00:25:41,896
Custom Apps used to be available


887
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:43,276
only to developers selling an


888
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:45,266
app to another organization, but


889
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:46,606
you can now use it to distribute


890
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:48,146
internally to your own employees


891
00:25:48,586 --> 00:25:49,876
just like you would leverage


892
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:51,126
in-house distribution.


893
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:53,286
This make it much easier to


894
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:54,076
distribute apps to your


895
00:25:54,076 --> 00:25:56,976
employees, and Custom Apps works


896
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,586
for distributing to employees,


897
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:01,456
partners, clients, franchisees,


898
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:02,246
or affiliates.


899
00:26:03,316 --> 00:26:05,016
Customers can also distribute


900
00:26:05,016 --> 00:26:07,186
licenses via MDM or leverage


901
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:08,696
redemption codes.


902
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:11,066
For those of you who are used to


903
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:12,306
the Apple Developer Enterprise


904
00:26:12,346 --> 00:26:14,126
Program, Custom Apps offers a


905
00:26:14,126 --> 00:26:14,786
lot of benefits.


906
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:17,136
You'll only need one program to


907
00:26:17,136 --> 00:26:18,556
manage both your App Store and


908
00:26:18,556 --> 00:26:20,086
your internal apps.


909
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:22,046
The apps won't expire, so you


910
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:22,866
don't need to worry about


911
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:24,726
distribution certs being revoked


912
00:26:24,726 --> 00:26:25,386
or expiring.


913
00:26:26,776 --> 00:26:28,596
While with in-house distribution


914
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:29,666
you could only distribute to


915
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:31,636
employees, Custom Apps actually


916
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:32,706
allows you to reach a broader


917
00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:34,046
audience, including business


918
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:34,676
affiliates.


919
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:37,456
It's also easier to work with


920
00:26:37,456 --> 00:26:38,736
third-party developers because


921
00:26:38,736 --> 00:26:40,516
you can get and distribute an


922
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,276
app from them without having


923
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:43,576
access to the source code, and


924
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:44,936
there's no re-signing of


925
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:45,896
binaries involved.


926
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:48,366
You can also take advantage of


927
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:50,036
the App Store's auto update


928
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:51,726
infrastructure, features like


929
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,806
caching and app thinning as well


930
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:55,586
as the TestFlight and App Store


931
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:57,876
Connect tools.


932
00:26:58,046 --> 00:26:59,316
Here's how you would actually go


933
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:00,536
about submitting a Custom App.


934
00:27:01,656 --> 00:27:03,246
First, you would confirm that


935
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,636
your account is properly set up


936
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:05,776
to support Custom Apps.


937
00:27:06,436 --> 00:27:07,846
Both app agreements need to be


938
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:09,566
active, and you need to provide


939
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:11,196
banking and tax information.


940
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:13,686
You can leverage roles to define


941
00:27:13,686 --> 00:27:15,226
proper access for the project


942
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:17,036
team once you have the app set


943
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:17,906
up.


944
00:27:19,076 --> 00:27:20,786
A developer would create a new


945
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:22,316
app identifier in the member


946
00:27:22,316 --> 00:27:23,716
center of the developer website


947
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:25,926
and also a new app record in App


948
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:26,506
Store Connect.


949
00:27:27,786 --> 00:27:29,416
Anytime that you want to list a


950
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:31,216
custom app for sale, you need to


951
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,376
create a new app ID and a new


952
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:34,016
app record.


953
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:36,246
The same bundle identifier


954
00:27:36,246 --> 00:27:38,176
cannot be available in both the


955
00:27:38,236 --> 00:27:40,596
public App Store and privately


956
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:41,296
as a custom app.


957
00:27:41,906 --> 00:27:43,226
They're totally separate apps


958
00:27:43,546 --> 00:27:45,436
with separate bundle InDesign.


959
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:48,386
Next, you would upload a build


960
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:49,896
and attach it to the working


961
00:27:49,896 --> 00:27:53,946
version in App Store Connect.


962
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:55,156
Beta testing would be done with


963
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:55,676
TestFlight.


964
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:58,286
When Beta Testing is complete,


965
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:00,506
all of the app metadata and


966
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:01,836
finalized marketing material


967
00:28:01,836 --> 00:28:03,656
should be verified and added.


968
00:28:03,656 --> 00:28:08,286
You would then list the app for


969
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,156
sale as a custom app in the


970
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,616
pricing and availability


971
00:28:11,616 --> 00:28:12,086
section.


972
00:28:13,396 --> 00:28:15,096
Note, once an app is submitted


973
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:17,036
for review as either a custom


974
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:19,026
app or a public app, you can't


975
00:28:19,026 --> 00:28:20,596
go back and change the audience


976
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,666
from public to private for vice


977
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:23,596
versa later on.


978
00:28:24,276 --> 00:28:25,896
To list the app for sale as a


979
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:27,076
custom app for business, you


980
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:29,556
need to provide the customer's


981
00:28:29,556 --> 00:28:31,786
DEP ID and organization name.


982
00:28:32,356 --> 00:28:35,636
The DEP ID is a unique


983
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:36,996
identifier given to the


984
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:38,706
organization when they enroll in


985
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:39,836
Apple Business Manager.


986
00:28:42,076 --> 00:28:44,206
Finally, you would submit the


987
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:45,016
app for review.


988
00:28:46,426 --> 00:28:47,536
Once it's approved and


989
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:49,636
available, you customer can


990
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:53,646
purchase and distribute the app.


991
00:28:53,886 --> 00:28:55,416
Purchasing is done through Apple


992
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:56,246
Business Manager.


993
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:58,336
The customer would enroll at


994
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,436
business.apple.com, and with


995
00:29:00,436 --> 00:29:02,156
this program, they can buy App


996
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:03,836
Store apps, custom apps and


997
00:29:03,836 --> 00:29:05,626
books in bulk, and deploy to


998
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:06,746
their devices and users.


999
00:29:07,486 --> 00:29:08,836
They can also do app license


1000
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:09,406
management.


1001
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:11,566
Note that this needs to be set


1002
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:13,006
up in advance of you listing the


1003
00:29:13,006 --> 00:29:14,246
app for sale as a custom app


1004
00:29:14,776 --> 00:29:16,236
because you need that DEP ID and


1005
00:29:16,236 --> 00:29:18,556
organization name to distribute


1006
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:20,226
the app to them.


1007
00:29:20,386 --> 00:29:21,536
And Custom Apps will also be


1008
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,836
available for Apple School


1009
00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:23,936
Manager this fall.


1010
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:27,646
This is what Apple Business


1011
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:28,516
Manager looks like.


1012
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:30,766
Your customer will see the app


1013
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:32,046
that you are listing for sale


1014
00:29:32,046 --> 00:29:35,056
for them under the Custom Apps


1015
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:36,026
section.


1016
00:29:36,156 --> 00:29:37,556
Let's review what this process


1017
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:39,326
looks like end-to-end for both


1018
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:40,626
the customer and the developer.


1019
00:29:41,556 --> 00:29:43,276
The customer first provides you


1020
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:45,096
with their organization name and


1021
00:29:45,096 --> 00:29:46,306
DEP ID from Apple Business


1022
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:46,806
Manager.


1023
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:49,806
Once you have that, when you set


1024
00:29:49,806 --> 00:29:51,026
up the App in App Store Connect,


1025
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:52,966
in the pricing and availability


1026
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:54,756
section, you select to make it


1027
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:56,876
available privately as a Custom


1028
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:59,196
App for business and specify


1029
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:00,846
that DEP ID and organization


1030
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:00,976
name.


1031
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:03,846
Once the app is submitted and


1032
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,586
approved, the customer can then


1033
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:07,276
go and purchase licenses of it


1034
00:30:07,536 --> 00:30:08,706
from Apple Business Manager.


1035
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:12,586
If for some reason you aren't


1036
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:14,796
able to submit a custom app or


1037
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,486
your customer isn't able to see


1038
00:30:16,486 --> 00:30:17,936
an app that you've assigned to


1039
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:19,726
them, here are a few places that


1040
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:20,726
you can troubleshoot.


1041
00:30:21,576 --> 00:30:23,136
First, on the developer side,


1042
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:25,246
make sure both the free and paid


1043
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:27,376
agreements are complete as well


1044
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:28,236
as all of your banking


1045
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:28,966
information.


1046
00:30:29,856 --> 00:30:31,406
If the customer isn't able to


1047
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:33,056
see the app, make sure that


1048
00:30:33,056 --> 00:30:34,236
Custom Apps are enabled for


1049
00:30:34,236 --> 00:30:36,146
their account under settings and


1050
00:30:36,146 --> 00:30:37,656
enrollment info in Apple


1051
00:30:37,656 --> 00:30:38,556
Business Manager.


1052
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:40,986
It also may take a few minutes


1053
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:43,016
for the app to become visible in


1054
00:30:43,056 --> 00:30:44,696
Apple Business Manager, so just


1055
00:30:44,696 --> 00:30:45,746
give it a little bit of time,


1056
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:48,286
and you can also consult the App


1057
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:49,686
Store Connect help page for more


1058
00:30:49,686 --> 00:30:50,336
information.


1059
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:54,806
Here are a few things to keep in


1060
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:56,926
mind about Custom Apps.


1061
00:30:56,926 --> 00:30:58,356
Customers need to have an Apple


1062
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,466
Business Manager account to


1063
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:00,006
purchase your app.


1064
00:31:01,296 --> 00:31:02,806
Apps have to support the


1065
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:03,906
countries that they will be


1066
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:04,756
distributed in.


1067
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:07,996
By default, an app is set up to


1068
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:09,616
support all territories in App


1069
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:11,556
Store Connect, and you shouldn't


1070
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:12,616
change this unless you really


1071
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:13,086
need to.


1072
00:31:13,966 --> 00:31:15,326
It's expected that if you're


1073
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:16,796
utilizing redemption codes for


1074
00:31:16,796 --> 00:31:18,776
distribution that they won't be


1075
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,216
made publicly available, and


1076
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:21,706
you'll instead make sure they


1077
00:31:21,706 --> 00:31:23,076
make it into the hands of your


1078
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:24,056
specific users.


1079
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:27,466
This is a new app that needs to


1080
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:29,626
go through app review, and the


1081
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:30,716
review team is going to need to


1082
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:31,766
be able to access the full


1083
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,886
functionality of the app.


1084
00:31:33,886 --> 00:31:36,206
And once submitted, apps can't


1085
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:37,876
be moved between public and


1086
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:38,976
private availability.


1087
00:31:42,096 --> 00:31:43,746
That concludes Custom Apps.


1088
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,916
We've covered the four


1089
00:31:46,136 --> 00:31:47,366
distribution methods that you


1090
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,856
have to choose from, and the


1091
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:51,156
easiest way to decide which is


1092
00:31:51,156 --> 00:31:52,626
right for you is to think about


1093
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:54,816
the audience for your app is


1094
00:31:54,886 --> 00:31:56,186
public or private.


1095
00:31:56,186 --> 00:31:58,706
Ad Hoc lets you distribute to a


1096
00:31:58,706 --> 00:32:00,966
limited private audience for


1097
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:01,486
testing.


1098
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:03,066
The App Store lets you


1099
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:04,226
distribute apps to the general


1100
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:06,796
public, and In-House and Custom


1101
00:32:06,796 --> 00:32:08,346
App distribution let you


1102
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:09,766
distribute apps privately.


1103
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:14,006
Let's review the distribution


1104
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:15,166
scenarios that we talked about


1105
00:32:15,256 --> 00:32:15,576
today.


1106
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:19,196
What if the app is for the


1107
00:32:19,196 --> 00:32:19,836
general public?


1108
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:21,946
If the app is for the general


1109
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,846
public, it belongs on the App


1110
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:26,756
Store.


1111
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:27,986
What if you don't want to give


1112
00:32:27,986 --> 00:32:29,296
up your intellectual property to


1113
00:32:29,296 --> 00:32:29,926
an enterprise.


1114
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:31,646
If you don't want to give up


1115
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,246
intellectual property, you can


1116
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:34,676
leverage Custom Apps to deliver


1117
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:37,266
them a private, completed app.


1118
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:39,036
And if you're writing an app for


1119
00:32:39,036 --> 00:32:40,326
the company where the audience


1120
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,826
is the general public, you can


1121
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,266
also deliver them a binary to


1122
00:32:43,376 --> 00:32:45,036
upload to their App Store


1123
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:46,426
Connect account.


1124
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:49,536
What if your customer doesn't


1125
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:50,806
have an MDM solution?


1126
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:53,426
The Custom Apps program along


1127
00:32:53,426 --> 00:32:55,346
with MDM can be used to deliver


1128
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:57,506
apps to customers who don't have


1129
00:32:57,586 --> 00:32:58,066
MDM.


1130
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:03,356
What if you're being paid as a


1131
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,806
consultant to build an app for a


1132
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:05,236
company?


1133
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:07,586
So you can work in both the App


1134
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:08,826
Store and the Custom Apps


1135
00:33:08,826 --> 00:33:11,476
program to, as a third-party


1136
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:12,656
developer, to deliver an app to


1137
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:13,216
someone else.


1138
00:33:14,156 --> 00:33:15,486
What if Apple Business Manager


1139
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:17,106
isn't available for my customer?


1140
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:18,886
So, if Apple Business Manager


1141
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:20,506
isn't available, your customer


1142
00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:21,786
should be able to leverage


1143
00:33:22,026 --> 00:33:23,516
in-house distribution providing


1144
00:33:23,516 --> 00:33:24,946
that they're building an app for


1145
00:33:24,946 --> 00:33:25,676
their employees.


1146
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,396
And what if the app is employee


1147
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:28,876
facing?

1152
00:33:38,156 --> 00:33:39,726

1153
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:42,346

1156
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:48,046
To conclude this presentation, I


1157
00:33:48,046 --> 00:33:49,366
want to leave you with a quote


1158
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:49,936
from a colleague.


1159
00:33:51,376 --> 00:33:52,846
"Apps are like cannonballs.


1160
00:33:53,586 --> 00:33:54,486
It's better to know where


1161
00:33:54,486 --> 00:33:55,806
they're going before they


1162
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:56,206
deploy."


1163
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,436
Apple wants you to be successful


1164
00:33:59,436 --> 00:34:00,536
and scale your app in the


1165
00:34:00,536 --> 00:34:02,296
smartest possible way, which


1166
00:34:02,296 --> 00:34:04,336
means thinking carefully about


1167
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:05,636
the user and the customer,


1168
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:07,216
managing your versions


1169
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:09,206
appropriately, and knowing and


1170
00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:11,396
understanding the guidelines or


1171
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:12,525
our developer programs.


1172
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:14,676
If you understand how this works


1173
00:34:14,676 --> 00:34:16,505
up front, you can pick the right


1174
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:18,036
distribution mechanism for your


1175
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:19,916
app and deploy it to your users


1176
00:34:20,255 --> 00:34:21,315
without any friction.
