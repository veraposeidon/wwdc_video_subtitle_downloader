[ Applause ]


3
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:20,546
>> Good morning.


4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,266
Great to see you.


5
00:00:22,376 --> 00:00:24,016
I hope you're all having an


6
00:00:24,016 --> 00:00:25,156
awesome WWDC.


7
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,696
We're super excited to be here


8
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:29,156
today to chat with you about


9
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:30,836
Building AR Experiences with


10
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:31,686
Reality Composer.


11
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:34,186
I'm Michelle and with me are my


12
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:36,286
colleagues, Pau and Abhi.


13
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:37,886
And today we're going to cover


14
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:39,876
what Reality Composer is and how


15
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:41,346
it can help you create an AR


16
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:41,876
app.


17
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:44,236
After this session, you'll know


18
00:00:44,236 --> 00:00:45,406
what's provided with Reality


19
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:47,406
Composer, how to set up your


20
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,106
experiences in it, and then how


21
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:50,716
to take in-- take what you've


22
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:53,366
created in Composer into your


23
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:55,956
app in Xcode.


24
00:00:56,116 --> 00:00:58,126
So, first, what is Reality


25
00:00:58,126 --> 00:00:58,626
Composer?


26
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:00,766
As you've heard earlier this


27
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:02,786
week, Reality Composer is a


28
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:05,446
tool, an app, to help iOS


29
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,586
developers get started in


30
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:09,546
working with 3D and AR.


31
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:12,886
Some of you have already begun


32
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:14,886
and it's been really, really


33
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:17,006
amazing to see what you've all


34
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:19,136
been making, posting, and


35
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:20,796
tagging with Reality Composer.


36
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:23,986
So, please keep doing it.


37
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:26,306
If you're not familiar with 3D,


38
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:28,616
the first time you ever open a


39
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:30,896
3D app can be pretty daunting


40
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:32,496
and it can be kind of time


41
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:35,036
consuming to even get started in


42
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:35,276
AR.


43
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:38,416
But with Reality Composer, it's


44
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:41,186
really easy to just pre-vis and


45
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,926
lay out your experiences using


46
00:01:43,926 --> 00:01:45,316
the built-in content library.


47
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,936
Or, if you prefer, you can use


48
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:49,236
your own USDZs.


49
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:52,016
And if you're not familiar, USDZ


50
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:54,456
is just a 3D file format that's


51
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:56,146
supported in Reality Composer.


52
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:58,926
Once you've got the experience


53
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:00,426
laid out, you can add simple


54
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:02,586
interactions and animations with


55
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:04,426
the behavior system before you


56
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:06,076
even commit to writing any code.


57
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:07,646
So, it really speeds up the


58
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:09,336
iteration time on the experience


59
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:09,816
itself.


60
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:12,066
And then finally, everything


61
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,116
that you've made in Reality


62
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:14,606
Composer you can take directly


63
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:17,736
into your app in Xcode.


64
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,656
And so much about building for


65
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:23,376
augmented reality is in seeing


66
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:25,376
how the experience feels in


67
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:27,476
physical space, looking at it on


68
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:28,936
the intended device and seeing


69
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,816
how your audience might see that


70
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:31,446
experience.


71
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:33,616
So, Reality Composer is


72
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:37,466
available on macOS, iPhone and


73
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,386
iPad, and you can edit on iOS so


74
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:41,826
that you can develop on your


75
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:44,216
regular dev machine and then


76
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:46,806
edit on iOS in order to continue


77
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:48,096
working on the exact same


78
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:50,406
project on iPad or iPhone.


79
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:53,716
Alternately, you can also just


80
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,536
start the project on your iOS


81
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:57,686
devices and take it the other


82
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:57,856
way.


83
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:04,386
So, today I'm going to take you


84
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:05,696
through building scenes.


85
00:03:05,956 --> 00:03:07,726
Pau will cover adding behaviors


86
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:08,666
and using physics.


87
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,106
And then Abhi's going to take


88
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:13,266
you through building an app.


89
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:17,536
So, for building scenes, first,


90
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:18,316
what's a scene?


91
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:20,746
So, as you may have heard in the


92
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:23,206
introduction to RealityKit and


93
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:25,246
Reality Composer talk, a Reality


94
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,986
Composer scene is essentially a


95
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:29,126
collection of entities and it


96
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,486
contains an anchor, objects,


97
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:34,506
behaviors, and a physics world.


98
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:37,776
Every scene has exactly one


99
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,296
anchor, and when you start a


100
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:41,156
project or when you start a


101
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:42,996
scene, any scene, you'll be


102
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:44,836
asked what kind of scene, what


103
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:46,046
kind of experience are you


104
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:46,486
building.


105
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:48,576
If you're building something for


106
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:51,956
a room, a stage, or a tabletop,


107
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:53,466
you'll choose the horizontal


108
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:53,766
anchor.


109
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:56,246
If you want it to be on a wall,


110
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:57,216
pick vertical.


111
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:00,546
If you're augmenting a book or


112
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:03,326
some packaging, a brochure, or a


113
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,666
movie poster, choose the image


114
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,076
anchor.


115
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:08,506
And for selfie effects like


116
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:11,446
glasses or hats, choose the face


117
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:11,776
anchor.


118
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:14,616
Projects can have multiple


119
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:16,745
scenes but I think you'll find


120
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:17,805
when you're first starting out,


121
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:19,276
one or two scenes is usually


122
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:19,805
sufficient.


123
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:22,906
Okay, so in this case, let's


124
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:24,346
assume that you've picked the


125
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:25,296
horizontal anchor.


126
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,596
And so here we are.


127
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:29,896
The content is our focus in


128
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:30,636
Reality Composer.


129
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:33,236
So, it's laid out exactly as you


130
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:35,556
would see it in AR in the Main


131
00:04:35,556 --> 00:04:37,476
View Port or the workspace.


132
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,736
And this pane on the right here


133
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,116
shows you the properties of


134
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,406
whatever you selected and shows


135
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:46,116
you options for configuring that


136
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,106
entity, be it the object itself,


137
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:50,656
like this text that's selected


138
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:50,926
here.


139
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,476
You can see that it's selected


140
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:53,426
because of the ring.


141
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:57,176
You can select the object, or a


142
00:04:57,176 --> 00:04:57,596
scene.


143
00:04:57,856 --> 00:05:00,256
I could show you more slides,


144
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:02,836
but why don't we check out


145
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,886
Composer together on iPad.


146
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:07,046
Oh, I want you to remember this


147
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:07,526
scene, though.


148
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:08,456
Because we're going to be


149
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:10,296
building up this little tutorial


150
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:11,806
over the course of the session


151
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:12,186
together.


152
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:15,316
It's Seasons and Solar System


153
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:15,706
lesson.


154
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:19,946
We'll build up in AR.


155
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:23,676
Okay, so for our demo, I'm going


156
00:05:23,676 --> 00:05:25,556
to show you three quite


157
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,816
different RC projects today.


158
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:30,026
The first is a little primer.


159
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:34,426
And it's going to show you kind


160
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:35,736
of just five really basic


161
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,366
examples of things you could


162
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:38,546
create in Reality Composer


163
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,876
probably just in a couple of


164
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:40,316
minutes.


165
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:44,186
The second is a much more richer


166
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:46,696
and more complex experience, a


167
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:47,886
full experience, of what you


168
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:49,156
could create just in Reality


169
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:51,366
Composer alone if you didn't


170
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:52,636
want to write code at all.


171
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:53,816
So, this is great if you're not


172
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:55,406
a developer or you're just kind


173
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:56,506
of starting out and you want to


174
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,246
just try out the experience


175
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:00,926
before you fully commit to it


176
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:02,946
when you make your app.


177
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,776
And finally, we're going to


178
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:06,826
build that Seasons scene that we


179
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:07,536
saw together.


180
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:11,186
Okay, so here is the primer in


181
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:11,976
Reality Composer.


182
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:14,606
And I'm going to take us into


183
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:17,326
AR, because that was how we


184
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:18,146
intended to see it.


185
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:20,086
Okay, so these are the five


186
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:21,426
examples I mentioned, and let's


187
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:23,986
press play so that we kind of


188
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:25,826
see the interactions.


189
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:28,536
So, when we started, we're just,


190
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:29,126
oh, hi everyone.


191
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,236
When we just started, the spiral


192
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:32,976

193
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:35,316
And here, if I get close in the


194
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:37,106
second example, I can make this

196
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:42,886

199
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,076
It's kind of a fun sound.


200
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:47,866
And then someone had asked if


201
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,636
I'm an animator and I have my


202
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:52,266
own models, I have my own


203
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,676
animations, can I bring them


204
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:55,566
into Reality Composer?


205
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:57,856
And yes, you can.


206
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,746
And you can trigger them on user


207
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:00,806
interactions like a tap.


208
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,496
And if you're not an animator,


209
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:04,546
you can use prebuilt emphasis


210
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:06,416
animations on any object in the


211
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:06,856

212
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:08,546
Here we've applied them to some


213
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,936
pretty basic shapes but you can


214
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:11,236
apply them, you know, to this


215
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,416

216
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:16,266
So, that's the Scene in AR.

[ Applause ]


218
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,716
Next, I'm going to show you this


219
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:26,546
more complex experience, richer


220
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,176
experience.


221
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:28,986
Oh, and you're probably


222
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:30,036
wondering how I'm moving the


223
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:31,676
content around the scene and


224
00:07:31,676 --> 00:07:32,466
moving the camera.


225
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,616
So, for panning, all I'm doing


226
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:37,856
is taking two fingers, moving


227
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:39,656
them across like this so I can


228
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,406
see the content exactly as I


229
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:41,726
want.


230
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:43,906
If you were watching State of


231
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:45,506
the Union on Tuesday, this


232
00:07:45,646 --> 00:07:47,286

233
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:47,396
you.


234
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:48,846

236
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:50,706
So, if you imagine you're


237
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:52,406
making, like, a museum


238
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:56,006
installation or a tourism center


239
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:57,806

240
00:07:57,806 --> 00:07:59,426
that we kind of envisioned here.


241
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:02,036
So, let's look at this here in


242
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:06,056

243
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:06,896

So, you should hear some waves.


246

And now we're being prompted to


247
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:18,306
tap on the helicopter, so let's


248
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:18,606
do that.

[ Helicopter blades thumping ]


250
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:24,136
You can see we were also asked


251
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,886
to tap a location to learn more.


252
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:28,166
So, I'm going to do that tap on


253
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,516
these markers now, and you can


254
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:31,766
see I'm getting more information


255
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:33,336
about each location as I tap.


256
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,936
The other ones fade off.

And so I'm just going to take


259
00:08:45,296 --> 00:08:46,816
apart what we did to build up


260
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:47,546
this scene.


261
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:52,266
So, there's actually not much


262
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:55,226
custom content in this scene


263
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:55,586

267
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,016
You can see here we imported


268
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:02,506
them.


269
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:04,476
You can import more if you want.


270
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:07,136
The rest are just built in from


271
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:08,606
the content library that comes

00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:09,306
with Reality Composer.


273
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:10,386
You can see we have a lot of


274
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:12,076
stuff here.


275
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,736
Text, basic shapes.


276
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:14,746
And that's kind of what you're


277
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:16,416
seeing in this scene.


278
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,806

shapes.


280
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:22,156
We group them to create two

283
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:27,816
The other question we get asked


284
00:09:27,886 --> 00:09:31,526
a lot is I work mostly in 2D and


285
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:33,696
so I have a lot of photos and,


286
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:35,906
you know, company graphics.


287
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:37,556
Can I use them in Reality


288
00:09:37,556 --> 00:09:37,936

289
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:39,766
And the answer is yes, of course


290
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:40,936
you can!


291
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:42,346
You can bring them into the

293
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:48,496

294
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:49,766
Content Library that we just


295
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:51,926
saw.


296
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,556
Finally, you're probably


297
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:55,756
wondering how did we create


298
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:57,326
those little interactions.


299
00:09:57,686 --> 00:09:59,596
So, if we go to Behaviors by


300
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,066
clicking on this Behaviors


301
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:04,326
button in the top right, you can


302
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:05,496
see the Behaviors we used to


303
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:07,936
create the flow of that sequence


304
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:09,606
and those interactions.


305
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:12,116
So, we're billboarding things to


306
00:10:12,116 --> 00:10:13,376
look, you might've noticed as I


307
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:15,146
moved around the scene, those


308
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:17,346
items looked at me.


309
00:10:17,556 --> 00:10:18,926
So, we're using the Look At


310
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:21,346
actions here to make everything


311
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:22,206
look at the camera.


312
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:24,866
At the beginning, you saw just


313
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:28,006
the island, and everything else


314
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:28,626
was hidden.


315
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:29,596
So, you can see that we hid


316
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,126
everything else and then we


317
00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:32,766
showed them to you in sequence.


318
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:34,926
So, we waited for 0.2 seconds,


319
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:37,276
and then first we showed the


320
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:38,386
helicopter text.


321
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,526
Then we showed the helicopter


322
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:42,016
itself and its tap to start.


323
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,826
And then we faded the markers in


324
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:45,996
from below, so that's what this


325
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:47,336
move from below is doing and I


326
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:48,766
can preview that to you now just


327
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,356
by pressing play on the card.


328
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:55,336
I'm going to show you also a


329
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:56,216
little secret.


330
00:10:57,536 --> 00:11:00,066
These birds, you might've


331
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:00,946
noticed--


332
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:07,346
I'm just going to look at them


333
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:07,646
here.


334
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,226
So, we asked them to orbit the


335
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:11,466
island as a group.


336
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:14,646
And they're not really birds at


337
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:15,106
all.


338
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,886
They're just primitives that


339
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,336
we're using, or just basic


340
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:22,346
shapes that we've put two move


341
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:24,876
cards on to flap their wings.


342
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:26,396
So instead of investing time in


343
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:27,936
creating birds, all we did was


344
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:29,236
we took a couple shapes and put


345
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:32,426
two action cards on them to make


346
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:33,136
an animation.


347
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,126
And if you've tried to animate


348
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:36,516
something in 3D before, you know


349
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:38,446
how time consuming a simple


350
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:39,916
thing like this can be, and this


351
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:41,286
takes just a couple of seconds.


352
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:46,916
So, that's an example of a full


353
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,786
experience that you can make in


354
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:51,066

355
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:51,596
code at all.


356
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:53,656
And the really great part about


357
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:55,246
this is that once you have this


358
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:57,456
Reality file, you can just share


359
00:11:57,456 --> 00:11:59,986
it with anyone and preview it in


360
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,686
AR QuickLook, and the experience


361
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:03,046
will be exactly as you've done


362
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:03,636
it in Composer.


363
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:05,926

365
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:14,516
So, finally let's build up the


366
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,496

367
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:16,896
together.


368
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,456

371
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:25,276
So for this I'll just block in

00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:27,996
the scene with some placeholder

00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:51,486
So, let's grab this arrow to


383
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:52,326
move the Earth over.


384
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:56,636
And then next I need also a


385
00:12:56,636 --> 00:12:57,286
Moon.


386
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,276
So, let's duplicate this guy one


387
00:12:59,276 --> 00:12:59,976
more time.


388
00:13:00,686 --> 00:13:02,056
Bring it over to about here.


389
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:04,926
And then I can kind of grab


390
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:06,516
anywhere in this ring to move it


391
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:07,466
up in this plane.


392
00:13:08,056 --> 00:13:09,176
So let's move it over.


393
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:10,086
Okay, great.


394
00:13:10,086 --> 00:13:12,776
And now I want to scale the Moon


395
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:13,806
down a little bit.


396
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:15,236
So I'm just going to grab the


397
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:17,186
ring and move inwards to scale


398
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:17,926
it.


399
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:20,656
There we go.


400
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:22,956
Move it a little closer.


401
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:24,886
Okay, so I have these three


402
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:25,546
celestial bodies.


403
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:27,406
Let's scale the Sun up.


404
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:28,516
So I'll grab the ring again.


405
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:30,176
Just grab it to scale.


406
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:32,286
Scale the Sun.


407
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:35,896
So we've got our three items


408
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:36,126
there.


409
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:40,366
Next I'm going to add some text.


410
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:41,666
So I go to the content library


411
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,026
again.


412
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:43,596
Let's grab the text.


413
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:46,526
And it's a little bit below


414
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,836
where I want it to be, so I'm


415
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:49,496
just going to grab this green


416
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,366
arrow and drag it up.


417
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:52,926
And you can see it pop up to the


418
00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:53,956
ground plane.


419
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:56,536
And it's doing that because I


420
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:57,546
have snapping turned on.


421
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,466
So, if you look in the left


422
00:13:58,466 --> 00:13:59,276
corner, we have this little


423
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:00,846
magnet, and I can turn snapping


424
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:02,256
off if I want to move stuff


425
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:03,586
freely, but actually I just want


426
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:04,986
to pull this blue arrow to bring


427
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:05,456
it forward.


428
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,686
And I want it to be about half a


429
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:13,106
meter or so from the Sun.


430
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:16,396
And I'm going to open the pane


431
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:17,886
that we saw on the right to


432
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:19,156
change up the text.


433
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:21,316
So, let's just make it say


434
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:21,776
autumn.


435
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:26,646
It's super easy to just add


436
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:28,716
these elements in Composer.


437
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:32,096
So, finally, I think that's


438
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,156
pretty much where I want it to


439
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:34,496
be.


440
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:35,506
So, all I'm doing to move the


441
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,126
camera around is using my finger


442
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:37,956
and touching the screen.


443
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:44,096
Next I'm going to add an arrow.


444
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:47,946
And it's not pointing the right


445
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:49,706
direction I want it to be, kind


446
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:50,346
of rotated.


447
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,276
So, I'm going to move the camera


448
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:54,986
so I can see the green ring


449
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:57,266
which is sitting on the ground


450
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:57,536
plane.


451
00:14:57,826 --> 00:15:00,136
This ring rotates with the


452
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:01,386
camera as I move, so I can


453
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:03,186
always be working in the plane


454
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:04,766
that I want to be working in.


455
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:07,116
If I don't want to move the


456
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,496
camera to have to do that, I can


457
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:10,696
just tap on the arrow and that


458
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:11,936
will lock into the corresponding


459
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:12,086
area.


460
00:15:12,086 --> 00:15:12,856
You can see the ring got a


461
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:13,696
little fatter there.


462
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:16,636
So I'm just going to rotate the


463
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:18,356
area and it's snapping to 15


464
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:19,116
degree increments.


465
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:20,006
Again, because I have that


466
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:21,046
snapping turned on.


467
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:23,076
But if I didn't want to have it


468
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:24,396
snap, I could move it freely.


469
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,856
So here I'm dragging it and it's


470
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:28,726
moving always in the horizontal


471
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:30,056
plane for this green ring here.


472
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:31,966
But I actually do want it to


473
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:34,416
snap between the Sun, sphere,


474
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,586
and the autumn text.


475
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:36,576
So, I'm going to turn snapping


476
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:36,826
on.


477
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:39,066
You can see it snapping into


478
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:39,306
place.


479
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:41,626
So, it's just super useful,


480
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:42,186
super easy.


481
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:46,086
Then I want to modify this arrow


482
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:46,646
a little bit.


483
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:50,186
So, I can go ahead and click the


484
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:52,466
icon next to snapping to modify


485
00:15:52,926 --> 00:15:52,993
it.


486
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:54,906
I'm just going to zoom this in a


487
00:15:54,906 --> 00:15:56,026
little so we can see better.


488
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:58,376
And I can grab this handle.


489
00:15:58,806 --> 00:15:59,406
Drag it.


490
00:16:00,736 --> 00:16:02,356
I'm also just going to make this


491
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,926
just a touch smaller, a little


492
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:05,376
flatter.


493
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:09,196
Okay. And then I'm going to move


494
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:12,276
it just a little bit more.


495
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:13,656
Okay, so now everything is kind


496
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,086
of blocked out, and we did that


497
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:15,936
in just a couple minutes.


498
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:19,316
I actually want to replace these


499
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,046
celestial bodies because they're


500
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,356
all pretty indistinct right now


501
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:24,386
and I want to import some custom


502
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:24,966
USDZs.


503
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,266
And since I already have them


504
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,416
placed exactly where I want, I'm


505
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,246
going to do a replace.


506
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:32,206
So I just tap on this object.


507
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:33,726
I get this edit menu.


508
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:34,816
Hit replace.


509
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:40,946
And I'm going to import the Sun,


510
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:43,886
and it'll just replace.


511
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:45,386
And you can see it's the same


512
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:47,226
scale and it's exactly in the


513
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:48,336
right position that I wanted.


514
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:52,906
I can do the same with the


515
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:53,256
Earth.


516
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,946
So let's do that really quick.


517
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,976
There it is.


518
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:01,746
And the Moon, I'm just going to


519
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:04,766
customize it a little bit here


520
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:06,925
with some, let's see, I want the


521
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:07,986
map material.


522
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:09,386
And I can make the Moon, like,


523
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:10,886
any color that I want, but I


524
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:12,665
think I'm just going to pick


525
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:14,866
grey for the sake of safety.


526
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:18,826
And if I want to see any of


527
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:19,925
these items a little better, I


528
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,976
can just double tap on them to


529
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:22,766
frame the object.


530
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:24,046
It's a really easy way to get


531
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:24,906
around the scene.


532
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:27,106
Or if I want to see the scene,


533
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,696
pull back, I can double tap on


534
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:31,576
anywhere in the grid to see the


535
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:31,936
scene.


536
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:33,396
Those shortcuts are here too.


537
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:36,766
Frame scene or frame selected.


538
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:42,066
Okay, so we're just about ready,


539
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:43,666
I think, to add Behaviors.


540
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:45,236
I could add all of the other


541
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:46,526
elements but for the sake of


542
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:49,126
time we won't do all of that


543
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:49,326
now.


544
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:50,846
There's a few tips I want to


545
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:52,766
leave you with before we finish


546
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:55,666
this part of the demo.


547
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,156
That replace that you saw?


548
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,436
If we had Behaviors applied to


549
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:00,816
this already like we were doing


550
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:03,146
any animations on, like, let's


551
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:05,446
say the Sun, if I replaced it,


552
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:07,046
those Behaviors would stay.


553
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:08,566
So, it's a huge time saver if


554
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:09,766
you're just like swapping in new


555
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:12,186
versions of content.


556
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:13,196
It's really powerful.


557
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:15,386
And then also we mentioned


558
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:16,516
having multiple scenes.


559
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:18,096
You can access them here with


560
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,316
the Scene Selector in the top


561
00:18:19,356 --> 00:18:19,836
left.


562
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,446
And so if you wanted to add any


563
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:24,776
more scenes, you just add them


564
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:25,330
here.


565
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:29,206
If you are working with these


566
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:31,266
entities in Xcode, you're going


567
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:32,206
to want to name them.


568
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:33,556
And you'll see more about this


569
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:34,666
later on in the session.


570
00:18:35,136 --> 00:18:36,416
And you can do that when you


571
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,126
open the pane.


572
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:38,326
There's a configure panel and


573
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,436
you can just name the entity


574
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:39,766
here.


575
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:43,656
I'm going to name it Sun.


576
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,716
Finally, if there's something


577
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:46,316
you didn't want to do, like


578
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:49,226
let's say I moved the Earth and


579
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:50,126
I didn't want to do that.


580
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:51,906
I can undo that action.


581
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:56,806
I can also long press and redo


582
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:59,696
and it'll tell me, like, what


583
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:02,996
the undo that I, what the undo


584
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:08,226
is that I'm about to invoke.


585
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:09,456
Okay.


586
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:10,896
Finally, some folks have asked


587
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:12,026
what's the easiest way for me to


588
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,636
share my RC projects?


589
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:15,866
And you can airdrop them between


590
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:16,486
your devices.


591
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:18,326
Or like we talked about earlier,


592
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,266
you can use the edit on iOS to


593
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:21,746
go easily between your


594
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,716
development machine and your iOS


595
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:24,000
devices.


596
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:26,856
Okay.


597
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:30,616
So, that's our scene now, ready


598
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,006
for Behaviors.


599
00:19:33,096 --> 00:19:35,216
So, you just saw how to build


600
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,226
scenes in Reality Composer.


601
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,566
So, we took you through how to


602
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:41,476
lay stuff out quickly using the


603
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:42,476
content library.


604
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:44,426
We also showed you how to bring


605
00:19:44,806 --> 00:19:47,966
in your own custom USDZs.


606
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:49,306
And now we're going to move on


607
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:51,896
to adding interactions and


608
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:52,436
behaviors.


609
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:53,796
So, to take you through all


610
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:55,186
that, let's welcome my


611
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:55,686
colleague, Pau.


612
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:59,436
[ Applause ]


613
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:02,336
>> Thank you, Michelle.


614
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:07,666
So, now that we know how to


615
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,526
bring content to the scene, it's


616
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:11,576
time to bring all this content


617
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:11,926
to life.


618
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:15,346
So, you might want to play some


619
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:16,776
music when the user taps on an


620
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:18,836
object, or maybe show some text


621
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:20,466
when the user gets close to an


622
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:20,776
object.


623
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:22,906
Or maybe you just want to play


624
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:24,136
some USD animation.


625
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:26,206
And so in order to do that and


626
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:27,966
more, we need to take advantage


627
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:29,026
of Behaviors in Reality


628
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:29,476
Composer.


629
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:31,296
So, let's get started.


630
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:34,396
As we've seen before, a scene in


631
00:20:34,396 --> 00:20:35,656
Reality Composer contains an


632
00:20:35,656 --> 00:20:38,326
anchor, objects, behaviors, and


633
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:38,946
the physics world.


634
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,426
Behaviors are always scene


635
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:41,766
scope.


636
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:42,956
That means that you can only


637
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:44,676
target objects within the same


638
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:45,000
scene.


639
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:48,666
So, let's take a closer look at


640
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,536
what the behavior is.


641
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:52,326
A behavior is composed by two


642
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:54,196
items, the trigger and the


643
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:54,856
action sequence.


644
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:56,516
The trigger, as the name


645
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,546
suggests, is simply the criteria


646
00:20:58,546 --> 00:20:59,646
for the action sequence to


647
00:20:59,646 --> 00:20:59,956
begin.


648
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:02,276
So, let's say we have a scene


649
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:03,786
with a model of a record player.


650
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,696
And when the user taps on it, we


651
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:07,706
want to play some music and spin


652
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:08,386
at the same time.


653
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,936
Well, in order to do that, you


654
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,766
just need to create the new


655
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:14,776
behavior, use a tap trigger, and


656
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:15,996
then create an action sequence


657
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:17,976
comprised of a music action and


658
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:19,500
the spin action.


659
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:21,866
So, the first thing when


660
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:23,376
creating a new behavior is to


661
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:26,266
pick what trigger will begin the


662
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:26,906
action sequence.


663
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,336
Reality Composer comes with five


664
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:30,366
different triggers that you can


665
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:30,666
use.


666
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:34,426
With the start trigger, the


667
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,886
action sequence will begin as


668
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:37,116
soon as the scene is loaded.


669
00:21:37,116 --> 00:21:40,706
With the tap trigger, the action


670
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:42,566
sequence will begin once the


671
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:44,616
user taps on an object that you


672
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:44,896
define.


673
00:21:45,526 --> 00:21:48,226
With a proximity trigger, you


674
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:49,736
define a threshold distance from


675
00:21:49,736 --> 00:21:50,816
the object to the camera.


676
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:53,186
Once the camera is close enough


677
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,376
to the object, the action


678
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:55,206
sequence will begin.


679
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:58,756
With collision trigger, you


680
00:21:58,756 --> 00:22:00,656
define two objects, and once


681
00:22:00,706 --> 00:22:02,966
those two objects collide, the


682
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:04,176
action sequence will begin.


683
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:06,186
And the last trigger is the


684
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:07,146
notification trigger.


685
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,466
This trigger is what allows you


686
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:10,736
to begin action sequences


687
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:12,156
programmatically from your app


688
00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:13,876
and we'll take a look at this


689
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,116
trigger in the last section of


690
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:16,000
this talk.


691
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,376
So, now let's move into action


692
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:19,906
sequences.


693
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:23,096
There are three main ways that


694
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:24,816
you can modify the execution of


695
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:25,606
action sequences.


696
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,626
Those are groups, loops, and


697
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:29,856
exclusive action sequences.


698
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,096
So, let's start with groups.


699
00:22:33,096 --> 00:22:35,056
By default, in Reality Composer,


700
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:36,596
groups play sequentially.


701
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:38,476
So, the actions go one after the


702
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:38,816
other.


703
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:40,916
But you can combine multiple


704
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,106
actions if you want to play them


705
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:42,576
in parallel.


706
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:44,546
So, in this example, action two


707
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:45,926
and three will play together


708
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:47,896
right after action one finishes.


709
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:50,366
And action four will only begin


710
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:52,586
once all the action in the group


711
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:53,476
are over.


712
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:57,046
Action sequences can also be


713
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:57,306
looped.


714
00:22:57,996 --> 00:22:59,286
So let's say you want to have


715
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,016
some music in your scene and you


716
00:23:01,016 --> 00:23:02,566
want that music to loop forever.


717
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:04,226
Well, you just need to create


718
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:06,476
the behavior with music action


719
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:08,066
in the action sequence and mark


720
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,276
that action sequence to be


721
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:09,486
looped.


722
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:13,136
And the last part is the


723
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:14,376
exclusive action sequences.


724
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:16,606
In Reality Composer, you can


725
00:23:16,606 --> 00:23:19,346
mark an action sequence to be


726
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:20,296
exclusive.


727
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:21,776
Only one exclusive action


728
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,276
sequences will play at any one


729
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:23,586
time.


730
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:26,336
That means once an exclusive


731
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:28,666
action sequence starts or any


732
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,786
other running exclusive action


733
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:30,786
sequences will stop.


734
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:33,286
And action sequences that are


735
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,046
nonexclusive, they will play,


736
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,876
like, together with other


737
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:38,026
exclusive and nonexclusive


738
00:23:38,026 --> 00:23:38,696
action sequences.


739
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:41,146
And that's pretty much all you


740
00:23:41,146 --> 00:23:42,946
need to know about action


741
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:43,476
sequences.


742
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:44,966
So now let's take a look at some


743
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,236
of the actions available to you


744
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:47,496
in Reality Composer.


745
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:52,326
With the visibility actions, you


746
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:54,256
can bring objects in and out of


747
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,006
your scene using animations.


748
00:23:56,746 --> 00:23:59,286
So, we support multiple type of


749
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:00,566
animations, and you can use


750
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,396
basic things like fade in-fade


751
00:24:02,396 --> 00:24:02,646
out.


752
00:24:03,556 --> 00:24:04,946
But you can also use more


753
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:07,166
playful animations like scale up


754
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,796
and then scale down.


755
00:24:12,856 --> 00:24:15,266
Reality Composer also supports


756
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:18,396
animating objects in place with


757
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:19,826
the emphasis similar to the show


758
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:21,486
height, you can animate the


759
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:22,916
object with different motion


760
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,256
types and animation styles.


761
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,246
So, you can use BasicPop, but


762
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:30,186
you can also use a more playful


763
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:31,186
pop animation.


764
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:35,016
You can also spin or orbit your


765
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:38,246
object around other objects and


766
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:39,866
if you're using a USD asset in


767
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,476
your file, you can use their


768
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:42,586
transform and skeletal


769
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:43,056
animation.


770
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:48,156
Now, with the move actions, you


771
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:50,456
can translate, scale, and rotate


772
00:24:50,586 --> 00:24:51,516
an object in the same.


773
00:24:51,716 --> 00:24:53,986
With the Move By, the movement


774
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:55,616
will be relative to where the


775
00:24:55,616 --> 00:24:56,306
object is right now.


776
00:24:56,306 --> 00:24:58,366
Like in this example, where the


777
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,786
object always goes two units


778
00:25:00,786 --> 00:25:01,926
forward and one left.


779
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:04,436
And with the Move To, you can


780
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,516
always move an object to a


781
00:25:06,516 --> 00:25:07,806
specified location in the scene.


782
00:25:08,546 --> 00:25:10,226
Like here, where the object is


783
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:11,696
going back to the origin of the


784
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:11,966
scene.


785
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:17,006
With the Look At, you can make


786
00:25:17,006 --> 00:25:18,326
an object always face the


787
00:25:18,326 --> 00:25:18,706
camera.


788
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:20,966
Like in this example, where the


789
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:22,566
horse will always face the


790
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:23,396
user's device.


791
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:29,196
Now that we have all the


792
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:31,466
animation actions, it's time to


793
00:25:31,466 --> 00:25:32,946
bring some sound to your


794
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:33,516
experience.


795
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:35,256
In Reality Composer, there's


796
00:25:35,396 --> 00:25:36,496
three actions that you can use


797
00:25:36,496 --> 00:25:37,716
to bring some audio to your


798
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:38,466
scene.


799
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:40,986
With Play Sound, the audio will


800
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:42,076
originate from the object


801
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:42,426
itself.


802
00:25:42,926 --> 00:25:44,276
Like here, where the horse is


803
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,066
doing a horse sound.


804
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:48,446
With Play Ambient, the sound


805
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:49,766
will be scene-oriented.


806
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:53,746
And with Play Music, the audio


807
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:54,746
will play without any


808
00:25:54,746 --> 00:25:55,476
transformations.


809
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:58,986
So now let's take a quick demo,


810
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,556
and let's take a quick look at


811
00:26:00,556 --> 00:26:02,346
how to bring some behaviors to


812
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:04,176
the scene Michelle was building


813
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:04,506
before.


814
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,346
Here we have a more complete


815
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:10,046
scene compared to what Michelle


816
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:10,496
was building.


817
00:26:10,496 --> 00:26:12,566
So, we have the Moon, the Earth,


818
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:14,406
the Sun, and we have some text


819
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,526
and some sunrays showing the


820
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:17,326
different seasons.


821
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,176
So, let's bring up the behavior


822
00:26:20,176 --> 00:26:21,646
final by clicking on the


823
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:22,986
behaviors button on the top


824
00:26:22,986 --> 00:26:23,496
right corner.


825
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:27,006
And as you see here, there's


826
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:28,366
already some behaviors.


827
00:26:28,746 --> 00:26:30,866
So let's hit play and see what


828
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:32,826
is going on in this scene.


829
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,466
So, you see here, there's no


830
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:37,576
movement for the Moon, the


831
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:38,286
Earth, or the Sun.


832
00:26:38,926 --> 00:26:40,356
But the different rays and


833
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:42,446
seasons, text, are appearing in


834
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:43,246
a sequential order.


835
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:45,416
So, let's go ahead and create


836
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:48,056
the new behavior for 20 minutes


837
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:49,516
the different Moon, Earth, and


838
00:26:49,516 --> 00:26:50,396
Sun objects.


839
00:26:50,866 --> 00:26:52,556
So for that, let's start by


840
00:26:52,556 --> 00:26:53,826
bringing a new behavior.


841
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:56,546
We hit plus, and then here we


842
00:26:56,546 --> 00:26:58,126
can see all the available


843
00:26:58,276 --> 00:27:00,696
presets that we can pick from.


844
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:02,456
But for this demo, we're going


845
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,606
to start with a custom trigger.


846
00:27:03,606 --> 00:27:07,576
Now the first thing is to pick


847
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:10,146
what trigger we want to use to


848
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:11,556
begin the action sequence.


849
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:12,646
And because we want to start


850
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:14,376
animating these objects when the


851
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,666
scene is loaded, we can bring up


852
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:18,806
the library and choose the scene


853
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:19,546
start.


854
00:27:20,836 --> 00:27:22,626
Great. Now it's time to start


855
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:23,576
with the action sequence.


856
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,296
For this action sequence, we


857
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:28,286
want the Earth to orbit around


858
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:29,876
the Sun, and then the Moon to


859
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:30,986
orbit around the Earth.


860
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,356
And at the same time, we want to


861
00:27:32,356 --> 00:27:33,816
spin the Earth and the Sun.


862
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:35,796
So let's start with the orbits.


863
00:27:37,596 --> 00:27:39,406
So we can bring the action


864
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:41,696
library and then select orbit as


865
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,506
the first action.


866
00:27:42,506 --> 00:27:44,286
The first thing when creating a


867
00:27:44,286 --> 00:27:45,936
new action is to define what


868
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,476
targets are the targets of the


869
00:27:48,476 --> 00:27:48,836
action.


870
00:27:49,046 --> 00:27:50,316
So in this case, the affected


871
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:52,346
object is going to be the Earth,


872
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:54,696
and the center is going to be


873
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:55,366
the Sun.


874
00:27:56,856 --> 00:27:57,346
Great.


875
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:59,186
We have all the properties like


876
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:01,426
duration, revolutions, align to


877
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,146
path, and orbit direction.


878
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:04,856
And for the direction, we want


879
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:06,086
to use counter-clockwise.


880
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:09,666
So, now, we can easily preview


881
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:11,086
this action by just hitting play


882
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:13,656
on the play button in the action


883
00:28:13,656 --> 00:28:13,876
card.


884
00:28:15,136 --> 00:28:16,666
That was a bit fast.


885
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:18,386
So, let's change the duration to


886
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:21,436
something more suited for this


887
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:21,756
scene.


888
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:23,636
Let's start with 20 seconds.


889
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:26,796
You can change duration and try


890
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,126
again.


891
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,466
And yeah, I think that duration


892
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:30,046
looks right.


893
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,616
Now, let's bring the second


894
00:28:32,616 --> 00:28:32,876
orbit.


895
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:36,706
So, we can bring again the


896
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:38,416
library and select orbit.


897
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:40,646
Now, the affected object is


898
00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:42,806
going to be the Moon and the


899
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,446
center will be the Earth.


900
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:47,896
The duration, we want it to be


901
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:48,746
the same as before.


902
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:51,316
And for the revolutions, because


903
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:52,126
we are not trying to be


904
00:28:52,126 --> 00:28:53,326
physically accurate, we just


905
00:28:53,326 --> 00:28:54,426
want to have something that


906
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:56,356
looks nice in the scene, we're


907
00:28:56,356 --> 00:28:58,146
going to use four.


908
00:28:58,296 --> 00:28:59,356
I think four is a good number.


909
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:01,216
And now because the Moon is


910
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:02,496
tidally locked with the Earth,


911
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,846
we want the Moon to be aligned


912
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:05,346
to the orbit.


913
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:07,666
So, we have to select align to


914
00:29:07,696 --> 00:29:07,986
path.


915
00:29:08,656 --> 00:29:10,306
And now the direction will be


916
00:29:10,306 --> 00:29:11,436
also counter clockwise.


917
00:29:12,276 --> 00:29:14,636
So, let's give that a try and


918
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,586
yeah, this animation looks


919
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:17,166
right.


920
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,756
So now that we have the orbits


921
00:29:19,756 --> 00:29:22,176
out of our way, let's begin with


922
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:22,896
the spin actions.


923
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:25,526
So for that, we bring another


924
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:28,556
spin action and let's start with


925
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:29,006
the Sun.


926
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:31,386
Same direction as before.


927
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:32,666
So, 20 seconds.


928
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:34,826
And for iterations, I think four


929
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:35,986
will be a good number.


930
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:40,016
And same direction, so counter


931
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:40,406
clockwise.


932
00:29:41,286 --> 00:29:43,776
If we hit play, we see that


933
00:29:43,776 --> 00:29:45,126
that's a good speed for the


934
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:45,456
spin.


935
00:29:46,366 --> 00:29:48,686
Right. So, now, let's bring the


936
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:51,116
last action in the sequence


937
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:52,376
which is the spin for the Earth.


938
00:29:53,676 --> 00:29:55,286
So, we create another spin.


939
00:29:55,656 --> 00:29:56,546
We select the Earth.


940
00:29:57,356 --> 00:29:58,296
Same duration.


941
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:01,026
And because we want to have a


942
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:02,526
higher number of iterations


943
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:04,956
compared to the Sun, let's use


944
00:30:05,576 --> 00:30:07,206
10 for this example.


945
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:09,356
And direction, again, counter


946
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:09,726
clockwise.


947
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:12,776
Let's give that a try and yeah,


948
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:13,316
that looks right.


949
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:16,306
So now our action sequence is


950
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:17,246
completely laid out.


951
00:30:17,486 --> 00:30:19,736
So, let's try to play the whole


952
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:20,366
action sequence.


953
00:30:20,546 --> 00:30:21,636
And we can do that by just


954
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:23,836
pressing play on the play button


955
00:30:23,836 --> 00:30:25,286
in the Action Sequence header.


956
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,646
And what we see here is that


957
00:30:28,646 --> 00:30:29,816
only the Earth is moving.


958
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,156
And that's because the action


959
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:32,796
sequence is playing all the


960
00:30:32,796 --> 00:30:34,176
actions sequentially, one after


961
00:30:34,176 --> 00:30:34,606
the other.


962
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:36,546
What we want to do here though


963
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:39,006
is to make all these actions


964
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:39,816
running parallel.


965
00:30:40,056 --> 00:30:41,636
And for that we can use drag and


966
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:43,126
drop and drag the different


967
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:44,336
cards on top of each other.


968
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,446
And just by doing that, we


969
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,076
create a group with the four


970
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:49,496
actions.


971
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:52,456
And now let's just go ahead and


972
00:30:52,456 --> 00:30:52,606
try [applause].


973
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:54,976
Thanks.


974
00:30:55,266 --> 00:30:57,266
[ Applause ]


975
00:30:57,516 --> 00:30:58,726
So, now, let's go ahead and hit


976
00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:01,336
play and see how all the


977
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:02,306
behaviors play together.


978
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:04,496
And what we can see here is that


979
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,146
now all the orbit and spin


980
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:07,606
actions play together at the


981
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:09,106
same time as the text, and the


982
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:11,546
rays appear in the scene when


983
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,476
the Earth is passing by.


984
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:19,706
[ Applause ]


985
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:22,156
Okay. Let's go back to the


986
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:22,223
keynote.


987
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:24,786
So, that's how it easy it is to


988
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:26,566
bring some interactions and


989
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:28,186
behaviors to your scenes in


990
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:28,916
Reality Composer.


991
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:31,626
Now, let's move onto physics.


992
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:34,536
And so in order to create


993
00:31:34,536 --> 00:31:36,056
amazing and immersive AR


994
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:37,856
experiences, you need your


995
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:39,816
objects to feed right into the


996
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:40,436
real world.


997
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,216
You need your objects to move


998
00:31:42,216 --> 00:31:43,026
like real objects.


999
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,016
And for that, we need to take


1000
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:46,636
advantage o this powerful


1001
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:48,316
physics engine available to you


1002
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:49,226
in Reality Composer.


1003
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:51,986
So, let's take a look at it.


1004
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,276
This is an example of a scene


1005
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:55,306
that you can build in Reality


1006
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:56,636
Composer using physics.


1007
00:31:57,346 --> 00:31:57,946
I use it here.


1008
00:31:58,286 --> 00:31:59,686
The sphere is falling because of


1009
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:01,226
gravity, then it's colliding


1010
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:01,766
with the pins.


1011
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:04,606
And right at the end, once it


1012
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:05,896
bounces with the green box,


1013
00:32:06,376 --> 00:32:08,436
it's, we show this, like, winner


1014
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:08,806
text.


1015
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:11,326
So, let's see how we can build


1016
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:11,976
this kind of scene.


1017
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,896
There's three different ways


1018
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:16,006
that you can influence the


1019
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:17,586
physics simulation in your


1020
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:17,916
scene.


1021
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:20,736
A variety of materials will


1022
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,306
define how your objects interact


1023
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:23,536
with the scene and with other


1024
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:24,026
objects.


1025
00:32:25,336 --> 00:32:26,376
With the force action and the


1026
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:28,866
gravity, you can determine how


1027
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,176
the forces will play into your


1028
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:30,466
world.


1029
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:32,856
And with the collision trigger


1030
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:34,826
and the collision shapes, you


1031
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:36,196
can define how the collision


1032
00:32:36,196 --> 00:32:37,986
mechanics will work in your


1033
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:38,806
physics simulation.


1034
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:41,476
So, let's start with materials.


1035
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:44,036
In Reality Composer, there's six


1036
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:45,186
different materials that you can


1037
00:32:45,186 --> 00:32:45,496
use.


1038
00:32:46,596 --> 00:32:48,216
You have to define the materials


1039
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,496
for the scene and for the


1040
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:50,026
objects.


1041
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,756
So, let's say you use material


1042
00:32:52,856 --> 00:32:53,456
for your object.


1043
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:55,326
Use ice as the material of your


1044
00:32:55,326 --> 00:32:55,536
object.


1045
00:32:55,976 --> 00:32:57,446
This will make your object slide


1046
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:58,036
through the scene.


1047
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:00,956
If you use rubber instead, your


1048
00:33:00,956 --> 00:33:03,356
object will be much more bouncy.


1049
00:33:03,896 --> 00:33:08,746
Now, let's move onto forces.


1050
00:33:10,206 --> 00:33:11,716
All your scene will have gravity


1051
00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:14,346
enabled by default and the value


1052
00:33:14,346 --> 00:33:15,356
will be set to the Earth's


1053
00:33:15,356 --> 00:33:15,736
gravity.


1054
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:17,346
But you can change that to any


1055
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:17,966
value you want.


1056
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:22,066
With the force action, you can


1057
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,186
give your object an initial


1058
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:23,676
impulse.


1059
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:26,276
You define a direction, how much


1060
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:27,716
velocity you want to give to the


1061
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:27,966
object.


1062
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:29,406
And you can build these kinds of


1063
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:30,896
behaviors where you can add the


1064
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:32,966
force once the user taps on the


1065
00:33:33,426 --> 00:33:33,686
object.


1066
00:33:35,676 --> 00:33:37,426
And now that your objects have


1067
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:39,426
materials and can be affected by


1068
00:33:39,496 --> 00:33:42,106
forces, it's time to make them


1069
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:42,886
collide with each other.


1070
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:45,516
So, by default, in Reality


1071
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:47,746
Composer, all the objects don't


1072
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:49,066
participate in the physics


1073
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:49,556
simulation.


1074
00:33:50,046 --> 00:33:51,426
If you want your objects to


1075
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:52,986
collide with other objects, you


1076
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:55,206
have to set the collide option.


1077
00:33:55,656 --> 00:33:57,886
If you want your objects to be


1078
00:33:57,886 --> 00:33:59,516
moved by the physics simulation,


1079
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:01,586
you need to set the simulate


1080
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:01,936
option.


1081
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:04,496
So, here you can see how default


1082
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:06,596
collides and simulate options


1083
00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:08,786
affect the objects in the scene.


1084
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:15,275
[ Applause ]


1085
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,235
So, the collision mechanics are


1086
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:18,886
determined by the shapes of the


1087
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:19,636
object in a scene.


1088
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:21,516
In Reality Composer, there's


1089
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:23,166
three different shapes that you


1090
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:23,556
can use.


1091
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:25,956
And those are box, sphere, and


1092
00:34:25,956 --> 00:34:26,335
capsule.


1093
00:34:27,476 --> 00:34:28,936
Those shapes will determine how


1094
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:30,815
your object moves in the scene


1095
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:32,346
and how it collides with other


1096
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:34,916
objects and the anchor.


1097
00:34:37,295 --> 00:34:39,116
And with the collide trigger,


1098
00:34:39,356 --> 00:34:40,266
you can build these kinds of


1099
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:42,606
behaviors where here we have a


1100
00:34:42,656 --> 00:34:44,666
collide trigger with the sphere


1101
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,335
and the box.


1102
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,386
And that way we can detect when


1103
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:49,096
the user is winning this game


1104
00:34:49,326 --> 00:34:50,565
and show the winner text.


1105
00:34:54,716 --> 00:34:56,456
And that's pretty much all we


1106
00:34:56,456 --> 00:34:57,666
have to say about physics in


1107
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:58,396
Reality Composer.


1108
00:34:59,326 --> 00:35:00,696
So now I would like to hand it


1109
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:02,276
over to my colleague, Abhi, to


1110
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:03,676
talk you through how to build


1111
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:04,956
apps using Reality Composer.


1112
00:35:05,096 --> 00:35:06,976
Abhi?


1113
00:35:07,516 --> 00:35:10,766
[ Applause ]


1114
00:35:11,266 --> 00:35:11,946
>> Hi everyone.


1115
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:12,586
My name is Abhi.


1116
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:13,816
I'm super excited to be here


1117
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:14,236
today.


1118
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:15,406
So, earlier in the session, we


1119
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:17,296
saw how with Reality Composer we


1120
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:18,736
can create amazing 3D


1121
00:35:18,736 --> 00:35:20,426
experiences and then bring it to


1122
00:35:20,426 --> 00:35:21,636
life with behaviors.


1123
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,096
Now, let's see how we can take


1124
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:24,746
those AR experiences and


1125
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:27,616
integrate them into our app.


1126
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,956
So to get started, we provide


1127
00:35:28,956 --> 00:35:29,586
three different ways.


1128
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:32,056
The first is create a new


1129
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:34,386
RealityKit AR or Game template


1130
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:35,036
right in Xcode.


1131
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:37,516
Then second is to create a new


1132
00:35:37,516 --> 00:35:39,166
project from Reality Composer.


1133
00:35:39,796 --> 00:35:41,076
And the third is to export a


1134
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:42,926
Reality file from Reality


1135
00:35:42,926 --> 00:35:44,356
Composer and then include it


1136
00:35:44,356 --> 00:35:45,586
inside your app.


1137
00:35:46,596 --> 00:35:47,936
To get started, let's start


1138
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:49,416
about the two essential files,


1139
00:35:49,506 --> 00:35:51,346
the Reality Composer project and


1140
00:35:51,346 --> 00:35:52,096
the Reality file.


1141
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:53,806
And we'll get started by talking


1142
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:54,736
about the Reality Composer


1143
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:55,156
project.


1144
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,296
So, this is the project file for


1145
00:35:58,296 --> 00:35:59,056
Reality Composer.


1146
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:01,036
It's included automatically


1147
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:03,606
inside of RealityKit AR and Game


1148
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:04,156
templates.


1149
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:06,506
It's previewable right inside of


1150
00:36:06,506 --> 00:36:07,586
Xcode; we have Xcode


1151
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:08,186
integration.


1152
00:36:08,846 --> 00:36:10,656
And Xcode automatically exports


1153
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:12,486
your Reality Composer project as


1154
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:14,026
a Reality file during the build


1155
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:16,426
step of Xcode.


1156
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:18,026
So, here we can see our Reality


1157
00:36:18,026 --> 00:36:18,886
Composer project.


1158
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:20,596
In Xcode 11, we're able to


1159
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:21,906
preview it and we're able to


1160
00:36:21,906 --> 00:36:23,176
preview each of our scenes as


1161
00:36:23,176 --> 00:36:23,476
well.


1162
00:36:23,476 --> 00:36:25,266
And in the upper right-hand


1163
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,356
corner, we can see an Open in


1164
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:27,816
Reality Composer button, and


1165
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:28,636
this will launch Reality


1166
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:30,236
Composer right from Xcode.


1167
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:33,736
As I mentioned earlier, if you


1168
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:35,326
have a Reality Composer project


1169
00:36:35,396 --> 00:36:37,216
in your Xcode application during


1170
00:36:37,216 --> 00:36:38,966
the build step, we automatically


1171
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:40,776
generate a Reality file for you.


1172
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:42,456
And it's included inside of your


1173
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:44,066
application, just like any other


1174
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:44,526
resource.


1175
00:36:44,526 --> 00:36:46,046
You can access it exactly the


1176
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:46,516
same way.


1177
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,556
So, what is a Reality file?


1178
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:50,906
This is a central object for how


1179
00:36:50,906 --> 00:36:52,746
you will use your application


1180
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:53,576
and work with your AR


1181
00:36:53,576 --> 00:36:54,046
experience.


1182
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:55,656
It contains all the data


1183
00:36:55,656 --> 00:36:57,796
required for rendering and


1184
00:36:57,796 --> 00:36:59,586
simulation, and it's optimized


1185
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:00,326
for RealityKit.


1186
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:01,986
Like I said earlier, it's


1187
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,646
exported from Reality Composer


1188
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:05,556
or it's automatically exported


1189
00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:07,286
by Xcode during the build step


1190
00:37:07,286 --> 00:37:07,936
of your project.


1191
00:37:08,346 --> 00:37:10,946
You can use a Reality file


1192
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:12,236
either by referencing it


1193
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:14,316
directly in your application or


1194
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,636
previewing it in AR Quick Look,


1195
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:17,406
and we encourage you guys to go


1196
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:18,536
check out the Advances in AR


1197
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,486
Quick Look session tomorrow to


1198
00:37:20,546 --> 00:37:21,926
learn more about that.


1199
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:24,726
Diving a little bit deeper, what


1200
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:25,886
is a Reality file?


1201
00:37:26,386 --> 00:37:27,526
So because this is a file


1202
00:37:27,526 --> 00:37:29,016
exported from Reality Composer,


1203
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:30,956
it'll contain each of the scenes


1204
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:32,476
that you've created in Reality


1205
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:33,146
Composer.


1206
00:37:33,146 --> 00:37:34,196
For example, we have two scenes


1207
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:36,646
here, and it also contains every


1208
00:37:36,646 --> 00:37:38,376
object that you've created in


1209
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:39,076
the application.


1210
00:37:39,076 --> 00:37:41,656
When we think about a scene in a


1211
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:43,186
Reality file, we consider a


1212
00:37:43,186 --> 00:37:44,966
scene an anchor, an anchor


1213
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:46,066
entity, specifically.


1214
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:47,796
So, this contains for example


1215
00:37:47,796 --> 00:37:48,746
the horizontal anchor


1216
00:37:48,746 --> 00:37:50,436
information that you set up in


1217
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:51,186
Reality Composer.


1218
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,396
So, we thought one of the


1219
00:37:57,396 --> 00:37:59,396
biggest difficulties in working


1220
00:37:59,396 --> 00:38:01,806
with Reality files was being


1221
00:38:01,806 --> 00:38:02,916
able to access things with


1222
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:03,486
strings.


1223
00:38:03,486 --> 00:38:05,426
And we both have the Reality


1224
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:07,316
Composer project and Xcode.


1225
00:38:07,726 --> 00:38:09,326
So, we wanted to introduce a way


1226
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:11,016
to make this very easy to work


1227
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:12,296
with, almost like just an


1228
00:38:12,296 --> 00:38:12,716
object.


1229
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:14,326
And so we decided to do that


1230
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:15,916
with code generation in Xcode.


1231
00:38:16,756 --> 00:38:18,266
What code generation will do is


1232
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:19,646
analyze the structure of your


1233
00:38:19,646 --> 00:38:21,726
Reality Composer project and


1234
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:22,966
generate an object, a real


1235
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:24,286
object that you can use inside


1236
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:24,996
of your application.


1237
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,966
So for example here, we have our


1238
00:38:26,966 --> 00:38:28,796
Solar System Reality Composer


1239
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:30,596
project, and we automatically


1240
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:32,316
generate a Solar System object


1241
00:38:32,316 --> 00:38:34,466
that you can use in your app.


1242
00:38:39,976 --> 00:38:41,516
So, the code generated for you


1243
00:38:41,516 --> 00:38:43,416
is an application-specific API


1244
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:46,206
for your scenes, for your named


1245
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:47,636
entities that Michelle mentioned


1246
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:50,796
earlier, for notify actions, and


1247
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:51,826
for notification triggers.


1248
00:38:51,956 --> 00:38:52,976
And we'll get to the second,


1249
00:38:52,976 --> 00:38:54,956
those last two items later in


1250
00:38:55,856 --> 00:38:57,066
the session.


1251
00:38:57,226 --> 00:38:58,396
The first step to get started


1252
00:38:58,396 --> 00:38:59,696
with code generation and working


1253
00:38:59,696 --> 00:39:01,286
with your AR experience is to


1254
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:02,566
give names to everything you


1255
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:04,266
care about and one axis in code


1256
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:05,756
right in Reality Composer.


1257
00:39:06,086 --> 00:39:07,126
And you can do that here in the


1258
00:39:07,196 --> 00:39:08,936
Settings pane under Configure.


1259
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:10,296
So for example here we've given


1260
00:39:10,296 --> 00:39:13,036
the Sun, our Sun USDZ that we


1261
00:39:13,036 --> 00:39:14,676
imported, the name Sun.


1262
00:39:14,756 --> 00:39:16,236
And we'll use this name to


1263
00:39:16,236 --> 00:39:17,086
access it in code.


1264
00:39:17,726 --> 00:39:20,086
So, how does our Reality


1265
00:39:20,086 --> 00:39:21,656
Composer project get converted


1266
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:24,126
into an object that we can use?


1267
00:39:24,756 --> 00:39:26,396
At the top level, our Reality


1268
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:28,516
Composer project becomes, for


1269
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:30,166
example, solarsystem.swift.


1270
00:39:30,926 --> 00:39:33,146
Our scene becomes an entity that


1271
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:33,806
has anchoring.


1272
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,046
And this is really important,


1273
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:35,996
because it means when you load


1274
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:37,166
it, you can add it right into


1275
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,426
your scene's anchors.


1276
00:39:39,426 --> 00:39:40,986
Additionally, any objects you


1277
00:39:40,986 --> 00:39:42,416
set up get converted into


1278
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:42,826
entities.


1279
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:44,296
These are real RealityKit


1280
00:39:44,296 --> 00:39:45,306
entities that you can use.


1281
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:46,366
You can work with exactly the


1282
00:39:46,366 --> 00:39:46,896
same way.


1283
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:50,216
In addition, we also provide two


1284
00:39:50,216 --> 00:39:51,186
different ways to load your


1285
00:39:51,186 --> 00:39:51,756
scene.


1286
00:39:51,946 --> 00:39:53,716
One that is synchronous and one


1287
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:54,676
that is asynchronous.


1288
00:39:55,246 --> 00:39:58,626
So, taking a look at loading a


1289
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:00,876
Reality file synchronously, here


1290
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:02,826
we have our solar system as our


1291
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:04,336
example again and we'd like to


1292
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:05,566
load the seasonsChapter.


1293
00:40:05,566 --> 00:40:07,556
And we can do that with a single


1294
00:40:07,556 --> 00:40:07,896
line of code.


1295
00:40:07,896 --> 00:40:10,826
So, we can say solarsystem.load


1296
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:11,536
seasons chapter.


1297
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:13,046
And we'll get returned an anchor


1298
00:40:13,046 --> 00:40:14,196
that we can then add into our


1299
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:14,586
view.


1300
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:15,536
It's super simple.


1301
00:40:17,296 --> 00:40:19,316
Next, if we want to load our


1302
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,806
seasonschapter asynchronously or


1303
00:40:20,806 --> 00:40:22,746
any scene, we can use for


1304
00:40:22,746 --> 00:40:24,896
example the solarsystem.load


1305
00:40:24,896 --> 00:40:26,736
seasons chapter async, and we'll


1306
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:27,726
get a result object.


1307
00:40:27,836 --> 00:40:29,206
And we can handle the success


1308
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:29,476
case.


1309
00:40:29,956 --> 00:40:30,696
We'll get the anchor.


1310
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:32,716
Or we can handle the failure


1311
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:34,166
case, and display the error to


1312
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:34,556
the user.


1313
00:40:35,116 --> 00:40:37,566
In addition, if we want to


1314
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:38,876
access the named entities in our


1315
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:41,056
scene, we can do so as easily as


1316
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:44,036
calling for example seasons.sun,


1317
00:40:44,036 --> 00:40:45,136
.earth, and .moon.


1318
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:46,576
And this will give us access to


1319
00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:47,846
the entity that we named in


1320
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:48,596
Reality Composer.


1321
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:49,996
It's just like working with any


1322
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:50,556
other object.


1323
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:53,466
So, putting it all together with


1324
00:40:53,466 --> 00:40:55,236
code generation in Xcode and


1325
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:57,286
Reality Composer, we can load


1326
00:40:57,286 --> 00:40:58,356
our AR experience in our


1327
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:00,146
application with just two lines


1328
00:41:00,146 --> 00:41:00,506
of code.


1329
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:03,186
The first is loading our chapter


1330
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:05,046
or loading our scene, and the


1331
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,916
second is adding it right into


1332
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:07,426
our view.


1333
00:41:07,586 --> 00:41:09,886
It's super easy.


1334
00:41:10,516 --> 00:41:15,416
[ Applause ]


1335
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:17,886
So, that's code generation in


1336
00:41:17,886 --> 00:41:18,356
Xcode.


1337
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,196
We also provide a way to access


1338
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:21,046
your Reality file.


1339
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:22,356
For example, in cases where


1340
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:23,736
you're downloading content off


1341
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:24,966
of a server and you want to


1342
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:25,746
display that in your


1343
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:28,036
application, to do that, we have


1344
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:29,256
RealityKit API.


1345
00:41:29,896 --> 00:41:31,286
So, to load a Reality file


1346
00:41:31,286 --> 00:41:33,136
synchronously, you first need to


1347
00:41:33,136 --> 00:41:34,906
get the URL just like any other


1348
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:35,946
resource in your application


1349
00:41:35,946 --> 00:41:36,206
bundle.


1350
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:40,706
And next, using the entity.load


1351
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,586
anchor method, passing the URL


1352
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:44,146
of the resource, and the name of


1353
00:41:44,146 --> 00:41:45,016
the scene that you'd like to


1354
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:46,626
load, and this will give you


1355
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:47,926
back an anchor that you can use.


1356
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:49,716
Optionally, you can also use


1357
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,506
entity.load which will load the


1358
00:41:51,506 --> 00:41:53,216
entity tree without the anchor


1359
00:41:53,216 --> 00:41:53,716
information.


1360
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:56,496
To load your Reality file


1361
00:41:56,496 --> 00:41:57,806
asynchronously, there's also a


1362
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:58,986
way to do that.


1363
00:41:58,986 --> 00:41:59,966
So the first step is exactly the


1364
00:41:59,966 --> 00:42:00,286
same.


1365
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:02,806
Just get the URL resource of the


1366
00:42:02,806 --> 00:42:03,166
resource.


1367
00:42:04,256 --> 00:42:06,276
Use entity.load anchor async,


1368
00:42:06,436 --> 00:42:07,976
passing in the URL and the name


1369
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:08,766
of the scene that you'd like to


1370
00:42:08,766 --> 00:42:09,126
load.


1371
00:42:09,606 --> 00:42:10,556
This will give you a load


1372
00:42:10,556 --> 00:42:11,076
request.


1373
00:42:11,076 --> 00:42:12,886
And using the new combined


1374
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:14,726
framework, we can receive a


1375
00:42:14,726 --> 00:42:16,396
completion and then receive the


1376
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:17,856
value, and the value contains


1377
00:42:17,856 --> 00:42:18,916
the anchor that we'd like to


1378
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:19,086
load.


1379
00:42:19,086 --> 00:42:20,366
So, you can put this right into


1380
00:42:20,366 --> 00:42:21,126
your AR view scene.


1381
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,866
Accessing entities.


1382
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:25,026
You can do this through


1383
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:27,686
anchor.find entity, and then


1384
00:42:27,686 --> 00:42:29,006
passing the name of the object


1385
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:29,916
that you'd like to load.


1386
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:31,906
For example, Sun, Earth, and


1387
00:42:31,906 --> 00:42:32,236
Moon.


1388
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:34,546
So, that's how easy it is with


1389
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:35,806
code generation in Xcode with


1390
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:37,686
the RealityKit to bring your AR


1391
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:38,686
experiences into your


1392
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:39,076
application.


1393
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:42,806
So, next, let's talk about how


1394
00:42:42,806 --> 00:42:44,626
our application can interact


1395
00:42:44,846 --> 00:42:45,786
with our AR content.


1396
00:42:46,086 --> 00:42:47,046
We can create amazing


1397
00:42:47,046 --> 00:42:48,646
experiences right inside of


1398
00:42:48,646 --> 00:42:50,016
Reality Composer, but how do we


1399
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:50,906
actually work with it?


1400
00:42:51,206 --> 00:42:52,936
So, as Pau mentioned earlier, we


1401
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:54,446
have a great built-in set of


1402
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,076
actions already for you, but


1403
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:56,976
there might be actions that you


1404
00:42:56,976 --> 00:42:58,126
want to define yourself.


1405
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:00,336
So to do that, we've created the


1406
00:43:00,336 --> 00:43:01,226
notify action.


1407
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,506
This is an action that you set


1408
00:43:03,506 --> 00:43:04,516
up in Reality Composer.


1409
00:43:05,156 --> 00:43:08,536
It's called alongside your other


1410
00:43:08,536 --> 00:43:10,476
action sequences, exactly in the


1411
00:43:10,476 --> 00:43:11,056
same order.


1412
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:12,296
For example, if it's sequenced,


1413
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:13,486
it'll be called in that


1414
00:43:13,536 --> 00:43:13,966
sequence.


1415
00:43:15,346 --> 00:43:16,566
There's a settable closure in


1416
00:43:16,566 --> 00:43:17,746
your application code, so you


1417
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:19,696
can define the implementation of


1418
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:20,186
this action.


1419
00:43:21,546 --> 00:43:22,716
And just like accessing an


1420
00:43:22,716 --> 00:43:24,026
entity through code generation,


1421
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:26,096
the Notify action is also


1422
00:43:26,096 --> 00:43:29,066
accessible through your object.


1423
00:43:29,856 --> 00:43:31,786
So, in Reality Composer, we can


1424
00:43:31,786 --> 00:43:33,296
set up a notify action here and


1425
00:43:33,656 --> 00:43:36,016
we can give it an identifier.


1426
00:43:36,016 --> 00:43:37,566
This is the identifier we'll use


1427
00:43:37,636 --> 00:43:39,356
in code to reference our notify


1428
00:43:39,356 --> 00:43:40,836
action and provide a custom


1429
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:41,436
implementation.


1430
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:45,496
In the structure of our


1431
00:43:46,036 --> 00:43:48,226
generated object, the actions


1432
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,536
lives alongside your energies


1433
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:50,986
inside of the scene object.


1434
00:43:51,746 --> 00:43:53,106
So here we have actions and a


1435
00:43:53,106 --> 00:43:54,236
property actions.


1436
00:43:55,406 --> 00:43:56,796
Inside of the actions class,


1437
00:43:57,126 --> 00:43:58,216
you'll see multiple notify


1438
00:43:58,216 --> 00:43:59,906
actions that have the name of


1439
00:43:59,906 --> 00:44:01,106
the identifier you've given your


1440
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:01,696
notify action.


1441
00:44:02,086 --> 00:44:03,486
So you can access these as


1442
00:44:03,486 --> 00:44:04,866
simply as the loaded


1443
00:44:04,866 --> 00:44:07,186
anchor.actions and then the name


1444
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:07,916
of the action that you care


1445
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:08,146
about.


1446
00:44:08,566 --> 00:44:09,946
In addition, we also generate an


1447
00:44:09,946 --> 00:44:11,676
all actions array, so you can do


1448
00:44:11,676 --> 00:44:12,616
great things with this, just


1449
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:13,506
like any other collection in


1450
00:44:13,506 --> 00:44:13,856
Swift.


1451
00:44:14,126 --> 00:44:15,086
You can filter over it, you can


1452
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:15,746
iterate over it.


1453
00:44:15,746 --> 00:44:16,956
Anything you can do with an


1454
00:44:16,956 --> 00:44:18,506
array in Swift, you can do with


1455
00:44:18,506 --> 00:44:19,436
this all actions property.


1456
00:44:20,106 --> 00:44:22,306
To actually set the


1457
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:23,626
implementation of a notify


1458
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:25,846
action, you first need to access


1459
00:44:25,846 --> 00:44:26,956
it through your Alert anchor.


1460
00:44:27,356 --> 00:44:28,286
So, for example here,


1461
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:31,716
seasonschapter.actions .display


1462
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:33,826
Earth details, and then provide


1463
00:44:33,826 --> 00:44:34,586
the custom closer.


1464
00:44:34,796 --> 00:44:35,866
So .onaction.


1465
00:44:36,396 --> 00:44:37,526
And the entity that you'll get


1466
00:44:37,526 --> 00:44:38,866
returned inside of this closure


1467
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:40,706
is the target entity you set up


1468
00:44:40,706 --> 00:44:41,546
in Reality Composer.


1469
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,826
On the other side, to actually


1470
00:44:45,826 --> 00:44:47,736
kick off action sequences and


1471
00:44:47,736 --> 00:44:48,676
provide a way to do this as


1472
00:44:48,676 --> 00:44:50,406
well, we have a couple of great


1473
00:44:50,406 --> 00:44:52,166
built-in triggers such as Scene


1474
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,346
Start and Proximity.


1475
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:54,846
But there might be times you


1476
00:44:54,846 --> 00:44:56,636
want to provide custom triggers.


1477
00:44:56,636 --> 00:44:58,156
For example, selecting a segment


1478
00:44:58,156 --> 00:44:59,486
of control or tapping on a


1479
00:44:59,486 --> 00:44:59,726
button.


1480
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:01,436
And for that, we're providing


1481
00:45:01,676 --> 00:45:02,726
the Notification Trigger.


1482
00:45:03,846 --> 00:45:05,286
So Notification Trigger is set


1483
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,456
up in Reality Composer.


1484
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:09,016
It starts an action sequence or


1485
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:10,396
multiple sequences that have the


1486
00:45:10,396 --> 00:45:11,216
same identifier.


1487
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:13,896
It's posted from the runtime of


1488
00:45:13,896 --> 00:45:14,546
your application.


1489
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:16,606
And it's accessible just like a


1490
00:45:16,606 --> 00:45:18,246
Notify Action and acts as your


1491
00:45:18,246 --> 00:45:20,366
entities just by name in your


1492
00:45:20,366 --> 00:45:20,636
code.


1493
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:23,416
You can set up a notification


1494
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:24,806
trigger right inside of your


1495
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:26,816
behavior and here we have given


1496
00:45:26,816 --> 00:45:28,536
it the identifier show gold


1497
00:45:28,536 --> 00:45:28,846
star.


1498
00:45:29,256 --> 00:45:30,466
And we'll use this name in code.


1499
00:45:30,466 --> 00:45:33,916
Just like actions, it lives


1500
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:35,536
right alongside your entities in


1501
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:38,846
the generated code inside of a


1502
00:45:38,846 --> 00:45:41,516
new notifications object class.


1503
00:45:42,976 --> 00:45:44,266
And inside of Notifications,


1504
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:45,546
just like Notify Actions, you'll


1505
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:46,886
have Notification Triggers


1506
00:45:47,246 --> 00:45:48,506
corresponding to the names, the


1507
00:45:48,506 --> 00:45:49,806
identifiers that you've given to


1508
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:51,476
those Notification Triggers in


1509
00:45:51,476 --> 00:45:52,276
Reality Composer.


1510
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:53,856
And just like Notify Actions,


1511
00:45:54,076 --> 00:45:54,986
you have an array that you can


1512
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,396
filter over it or iterate over


1513
00:45:56,396 --> 00:45:56,696
as well.


1514
00:45:57,746 --> 00:45:59,196
That's called all notifications.


1515
00:45:59,726 --> 00:46:02,536
You can post a Notification


1516
00:46:02,536 --> 00:46:04,946
Trigger by calling the post


1517
00:46:04,946 --> 00:46:06,246
method, and this will fire an


1518
00:46:06,286 --> 00:46:07,696
action sequence or sequences


1519
00:46:07,696 --> 00:46:08,436
with the same name.


1520
00:46:09,296 --> 00:46:10,556
And you can also pass in an


1521
00:46:10,556 --> 00:46:11,566
optional override set.


1522
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:13,056
This is really powerful for


1523
00:46:13,056 --> 00:46:14,266
cases where you want to copy an


1524
00:46:14,266 --> 00:46:16,206
entity and dynamically call an


1525
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,066
action sequence on only the new


1526
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:18,476
entity.


1527
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:20,686
The overrides will take as a key


1528
00:46:20,686 --> 00:46:22,006
the name of the original target


1529
00:46:22,006 --> 00:46:23,546
of the action in Reality


1530
00:46:23,546 --> 00:46:25,106
Composer, and then you pass in


1531
00:46:25,106 --> 00:46:25,766
the new target.


1532
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:26,716
So when the action sequence


1533
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:28,846
runs, it only targets the new


1534
00:46:28,846 --> 00:46:29,176
entity.


1535
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:31,806
So, let's pull this all together


1536
00:46:31,806 --> 00:46:34,906
and let's check it out in Xcode.


1537
00:46:35,516 --> 00:46:39,500
[ Applause ]


1538
00:46:47,176 --> 00:46:49,066
So, here I have my application.


1539
00:46:49,066 --> 00:46:50,546
Over the course of the session,


1540
00:46:50,546 --> 00:46:52,156
Pau and Michelle have built up


1541
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:54,286
the Seasons chapter of our Solar


1542
00:46:54,286 --> 00:46:54,986
System lesson.


1543
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:56,536
And here I want to implement a


1544
00:46:56,536 --> 00:46:58,036
second chapter based on the


1545
00:46:58,036 --> 00:46:59,226
sizes of different celestial


1546
00:46:59,226 --> 00:46:59,646
bodies.


1547
00:46:59,966 --> 00:47:01,826
So here we have our Xcode 11,


1548
00:47:01,826 --> 00:47:03,906
just our base application, and


1549
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:04,876
we have already included our


1550
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:05,966
Reality Composer project.


1551
00:47:05,966 --> 00:47:07,646
Again, you can create a new AR


1552
00:47:07,646 --> 00:47:09,266
or Game template or you can drag


1553
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:10,616
a Reality Composer project right


1554
00:47:10,616 --> 00:47:11,756
into Xcode.


1555
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:16,726
We can preview the project right


1556
00:47:16,726 --> 00:47:19,106
in Xcode here and go ahead and


1557
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:20,286
open it in Reality Composer.


1558
00:47:20,926 --> 00:47:25,436
Let's take a quick tour of this


1559
00:47:25,436 --> 00:47:26,696
and the application before


1560
00:47:26,696 --> 00:47:27,356
writing some code.


1561
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,866
So, in our chapter we've set up


1562
00:47:29,866 --> 00:47:31,876
a couple of entities and we've


1563
00:47:31,876 --> 00:47:33,336
given our scene a name and we've


1564
00:47:33,336 --> 00:47:34,886
given different entities that we


1565
00:47:34,886 --> 00:47:35,486
care about a name.


1566
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:36,786
For example this gold star is


1567
00:47:36,786 --> 00:47:37,706
called special star.


1568
00:47:38,026 --> 00:47:39,496
This is the name we'll use in


1569
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:41,206
our code.


1570
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:42,266
Additionally, we've set up a


1571
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:43,196
couple of behaviors.


1572
00:47:43,196 --> 00:47:45,856
So for example, for the Moon, we


1573
00:47:45,856 --> 00:47:46,826
want to know when the Moon is


1574
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:47,926
tapped so we can store some


1575
00:47:47,926 --> 00:47:50,986
application state, and also hide


1576
00:47:51,546 --> 00:47:53,266
all the other text labels and


1577
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:55,166
only display the Moon's labels.


1578
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:56,196
And all of these actions happen


1579
00:47:56,196 --> 00:47:57,246
at the same time because they're


1580
00:47:57,246 --> 00:47:58,000
grouped.


1581
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,256
Additionally, we have a notify


1582
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:01,736
action and we'll use this to


1583
00:48:01,736 --> 00:48:02,756
know when the Moon is tapped


1584
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:03,876
inside of our application.


1585
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:05,816
We've implemented the same


1586
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,336
action sequence for the Earth


1587
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:08,306
and the Sun as well.


1588
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,646
We also have a Look At camera


1589
00:48:10,646 --> 00:48:11,866
action set up when the scene


1590
00:48:11,866 --> 00:48:13,646
starts, so each of our text


1591
00:48:13,646 --> 00:48:15,826
labels will look at the camera


1592
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:16,816
no matter where we're looking.


1593
00:48:17,376 --> 00:48:20,096
And we have a hide on start


1594
00:48:20,096 --> 00:48:22,096
action sequence which will hide


1595
00:48:22,096 --> 00:48:23,316
all the entities that we want to


1596
00:48:23,316 --> 00:48:24,866
view only at specific times.


1597
00:48:24,866 --> 00:48:25,726
For example, the chapter


1598
00:48:25,726 --> 00:48:28,646
completed, text, and the text


1599
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:29,846
labels.


1600
00:48:29,936 --> 00:48:31,046
Additionally, we have some


1601
00:48:31,046 --> 00:48:32,326
action sequences that will be


1602
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,206
triggered in code.


1603
00:48:33,206 --> 00:48:34,896
We'll get to this later in this


1604
00:48:34,896 --> 00:48:36,746
demo, that will scale the


1605
00:48:36,746 --> 00:48:37,726
celestial bodies to their


1606
00:48:37,726 --> 00:48:40,366
relative sizes, scale them back


1607
00:48:40,506 --> 00:48:41,456
to the same size.


1608
00:48:42,366 --> 00:48:44,286
Display the chapter completed


1609
00:48:45,296 --> 00:48:45,756
text.


1610
00:48:46,066 --> 00:48:47,156
Begin the Earth orbit.


1611
00:48:47,416 --> 00:48:48,766
And hide all of the other


1612
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:49,616
celestial bodies.


1613
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:51,396
And we have a cool little


1614
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:53,116
animation fired from a


1615
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:56,056
notification trigger that will


1616
00:48:56,056 --> 00:48:58,066
show the gold star, spin it, and


1617
00:48:58,066 --> 00:48:58,726
give it a bounce.


1618
00:49:00,046 --> 00:49:01,366
So let's jump back to our Xcode


1619
00:49:01,366 --> 00:49:03,746
application now and do a quick


1620
00:49:03,746 --> 00:49:03,946
tour.


1621
00:49:04,106 --> 00:49:05,466
So this application is pretty


1622
00:49:05,466 --> 00:49:05,976
straightforward.


1623
00:49:06,206 --> 00:49:07,516
It's a single view application.


1624
00:49:08,026 --> 00:49:10,356
And at the top level we have an


1625
00:49:10,356 --> 00:49:12,976
AR view, a segmented control to


1626
00:49:12,976 --> 00:49:15,676
switch between size and detail


1627
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,466
view, a lesson completed button,


1628
00:49:18,466 --> 00:49:19,636
so the student can just say I'm


1629
00:49:19,636 --> 00:49:21,676
done with the lesson and view


1630
00:49:21,676 --> 00:49:22,886
the chapter at the end.


1631
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,226
In a detail view, that will show


1632
00:49:25,226 --> 00:49:26,526
more details as we tap on the


1633
00:49:26,526 --> 00:49:29,506
Moon, the Earth, and the Sun.


1634
00:49:29,506 --> 00:49:30,506
Additionally, we have some view


1635
00:49:30,506 --> 00:49:31,906
models that will just drive that


1636
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:33,066
detail view, so it just shows


1637
00:49:33,066 --> 00:49:35,176
some text, and then some basic


1638
00:49:35,176 --> 00:49:36,736
application logic to kick off


1639
00:49:36,736 --> 00:49:37,166
our loading.


1640
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:38,736
And let's look at loading first.


1641
00:49:40,136 --> 00:49:41,356
So down here, the first thing


1642
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:42,896
you'll notice is we're using


1643
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,166
code generation in this project.


1644
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:46,846
So our Reality Composer project


1645
00:49:46,846 --> 00:49:48,086
is automatically converted into


1646
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:49,016
an object that we can use.


1647
00:49:49,016 --> 00:49:50,356
It's a real type, so we can use


1648
00:49:50,356 --> 00:49:52,216
it right here for the size


1649
00:49:52,216 --> 00:49:53,516
chapter property.


1650
00:49:54,506 --> 00:49:55,796
So for example, Solar System


1651
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:57,676
lesson.size chapter is a real


1652
00:49:57,676 --> 00:49:58,486
type that we can use.


1653
00:49:59,036 --> 00:50:02,016
We can go ahead and load our


1654
00:50:02,016 --> 00:50:04,066
scene and let's walk through


1655
00:50:04,216 --> 00:50:04,816
this code as well.


1656
00:50:04,816 --> 00:50:06,186
So what we're doing is loading


1657
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:08,426
the size chapter asynchronously


1658
00:50:08,836 --> 00:50:11,596
and then we're handling, we're


1659
00:50:11,596 --> 00:50:13,266
giving the loaded anchor


1660
00:50:13,546 --> 00:50:14,706
collision shapes so that tap


1661
00:50:14,706 --> 00:50:15,196
triggers work.


1662
00:50:15,196 --> 00:50:16,976
And then we're adding it into


1663
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:17,376
our scene.


1664
00:50:18,086 --> 00:50:19,086
Because we'll be using the size


1665
00:50:19,086 --> 00:50:20,546
chapter later, we're storing it


1666
00:50:20,606 --> 00:50:22,576
in the size chapter property and


1667
00:50:22,576 --> 00:50:23,816
we're setting up notify actions,


1668
00:50:23,816 --> 00:50:24,706
which we'll get to later.


1669
00:50:24,706 --> 00:50:25,806
Right now it's not hooked up.


1670
00:50:26,616 --> 00:50:27,706
So let's go ahead and run this.


1671
00:50:28,086 --> 00:50:29,046
We'll see with just a few lines


1672
00:50:29,046 --> 00:50:30,806
of code we're bringing our


1673
00:50:30,806 --> 00:50:32,596
entire AR experience and it


1674
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:33,896
should work exactly the same way


1675
00:50:33,896 --> 00:50:35,336
it did in Reality Composer.


1676
00:50:35,906 --> 00:50:38,036
So here we go.


1677
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:38,676
We have our scene.


1678
00:50:38,676 --> 00:50:39,556
We see the content.


1679
00:50:39,556 --> 00:50:40,806
For example, chapter completed


1680
00:50:40,806 --> 00:50:42,366
is hidden and when we tap on


1681
00:50:42,366 --> 00:50:43,856
each of our celestial bodies,


1682
00:50:44,266 --> 00:50:45,836
we'll see text automatically


1683
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:47,896
appear and it will face the


1684
00:50:47,896 --> 00:50:49,046
camera no matter where we're


1685
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,696
looking, and same with the Sun.


1686
00:50:52,076 --> 00:50:52,856
So, that looks pretty great.


1687
00:50:52,856 --> 00:50:53,866
With a few lines of code, we


1688
00:50:53,866 --> 00:50:54,966
brought our entire Reality


1689
00:50:54,966 --> 00:50:56,746
Composer project into Xcode.


1690
00:50:56,746 --> 00:50:57,496
It's super simple.


1691
00:50:57,946 --> 00:50:59,186
What I want to do next is


1692
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:00,676
actually fill in this detail


1693
00:51:00,676 --> 00:51:00,856
view.


1694
00:51:00,856 --> 00:51:01,916
You'll notice when I tapped the


1695
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:03,516
Sun, for example, the detail


1696
00:51:03,516 --> 00:51:05,026
view didn't actually get filled


1697
00:51:05,026 --> 00:51:05,196
in.


1698
00:51:05,256 --> 00:51:07,706
So let's jump back to Xcode and


1699
00:51:07,706 --> 00:51:09,626
fill in the notify actions.


1700
00:51:14,836 --> 00:51:17,186
So because our notify actions


1701
00:51:17,186 --> 00:51:18,586
are automatically generated for


1702
00:51:18,586 --> 00:51:20,336
us, we also get an all actions


1703
00:51:20,396 --> 00:51:21,846
array that we can filter over.


1704
00:51:22,096 --> 00:51:23,646
And we're going to filter over


1705
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:25,196
those actions to get only the


1706
00:51:25,196 --> 00:51:26,446
actions we care about which


1707
00:51:26,446 --> 00:51:27,186
begin with display.


1708
00:51:27,766 --> 00:51:31,576
So, let's walk through this


1709
00:51:31,576 --> 00:51:32,000
code.


1710
00:51:33,296 --> 00:51:35,066
Because we set up notify actions


1711
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:36,956
in our size chapter, we can jump


1712
00:51:36,956 --> 00:51:38,666
back to Reality Composer to look


1713
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:40,326
at those.


1714
00:51:40,536 --> 00:51:41,796
For each the Moon, the Earth,


1715
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:44,266
and the Sun, right here, display


1716
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:45,446
Moon details, display Earth


1717
00:51:45,446 --> 00:51:46,706
details, and display Sun


1718
00:51:46,706 --> 00:51:48,306
details, we can access these in


1719
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:48,566
code.


1720
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:49,996
And we want to actually filter


1721
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:51,946
over our notify actions for only


1722
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:53,516
actions that begin with display,


1723
00:51:53,746 --> 00:51:55,016
because we want to set the same


1724
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:56,536
closure for each of them.


1725
00:51:57,846 --> 00:51:59,036
So, jumping back to Xcode,


1726
00:51:59,486 --> 00:52:00,446
that's what we're doing here.


1727
00:52:00,606 --> 00:52:02,506
We're doing size chapter.actions


1728
00:52:02,506 --> 00:52:03,816
.all actions, and we're


1729
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:05,246
filtering over it, getting the


1730
00:52:05,246 --> 00:52:06,836
identifier from the notify


1731
00:52:06,836 --> 00:52:08,836
action object, and checking that


1732
00:52:08,836 --> 00:52:09,766
it starts with display.


1733
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:12,366
Next we're iterating over all of


1734
00:52:12,366 --> 00:52:14,126
the display actions and setting


1735
00:52:14,126 --> 00:52:16,306
the same closure for each using


1736
00:52:16,306 --> 00:52:17,306
the on-action property.


1737
00:52:18,456 --> 00:52:19,776
And we're taking the target of


1738
00:52:19,776 --> 00:52:21,426
our notify action, in this case


1739
00:52:21,426 --> 00:52:22,656
for the Moon it's the Moon, for


1740
00:52:22,656 --> 00:52:24,016
the Sun it's the Sun, and for


1741
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,506
the Earth it's the Earth, and


1742
00:52:26,506 --> 00:52:27,726
using that entity to display


1743
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:28,566
different view models.


1744
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:30,926
So let's run this application


1745
00:52:30,926 --> 00:52:31,096
now.


1746
00:52:31,636 --> 00:52:33,116
And what we like to see is


1747
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:34,176
different view models appear


1748
00:52:34,176 --> 00:52:35,646
when we tap on each of our


1749
00:52:35,646 --> 00:52:37,046
celestial bodies.


1750
00:52:37,876 --> 00:52:38,516
There we go.


1751
00:52:39,516 --> 00:52:41,146
So we have our content, and now


1752
00:52:41,146 --> 00:52:42,826
when we tap on the Moon, because


1753
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,826
we've set up a notify action and


1754
00:52:44,826 --> 00:52:46,376
we're observing those


1755
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:48,276
notifications, we're now seeing


1756
00:52:48,276 --> 00:52:49,646
the Moon detail right at the


1757
00:52:49,646 --> 00:52:50,266
bottom here.


1758
00:52:50,536 --> 00:52:52,056
When we tap on the Earth, we see


1759
00:52:52,056 --> 00:52:53,906
Earth's details, and we tap on


1760
00:52:53,906 --> 00:52:55,586
the Sun, we're seeing the Sun's


1761
00:52:55,586 --> 00:52:55,926
details.


1762
00:52:56,236 --> 00:52:57,146
That looks pretty great.


1763
00:52:58,616 --> 00:52:59,906
We also were keeping some state.


1764
00:52:59,996 --> 00:53:01,786
So, when we tap on all three of


1765
00:53:02,016 --> 00:53:03,256
our Earth, Sun, and Moon


1766
00:53:03,256 --> 00:53:05,296
actions, we're just making sure


1767
00:53:05,296 --> 00:53:06,146
that three different actions


1768
00:53:06,146 --> 00:53:07,626
were called, and we display a


1769
00:53:07,626 --> 00:53:09,086
complete lesson button up here


1770
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:09,866
in the right-hand corner.


1771
00:53:10,926 --> 00:53:12,576
So what we want to do now is


1772
00:53:12,626 --> 00:53:13,886
using Notification Triggers,


1773
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,096
fire off those size relative


1774
00:53:16,096 --> 00:53:18,016
size, and size to same size


1775
00:53:18,016 --> 00:53:19,556
action sequences that we set up


1776
00:53:19,556 --> 00:53:21,046
in Reality Composer using the


1777
00:53:21,046 --> 00:53:22,716
segmented control at the top and


1778
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:23,726
the button in the upper


1779
00:53:23,726 --> 00:53:25,000
right-hand corner.


1780
00:53:30,376 --> 00:53:31,956
So, we can do this with a


1781
00:53:31,956 --> 00:53:33,436
segmented control value change


1782
00:53:33,436 --> 00:53:33,686
method.


1783
00:53:33,686 --> 00:53:34,796
This is an Interface Builder


1784
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,336
method that we've set up and


1785
00:53:36,336 --> 00:53:37,836
hooked up in Interface Builder


1786
00:53:37,836 --> 00:53:38,226
itself.


1787
00:53:42,066 --> 00:53:44,076
And using our Notification


1788
00:53:44,076 --> 00:53:46,216
Action, Triggers, we can fire


1789
00:53:46,216 --> 00:53:47,656
the scale to same size action


1790
00:53:47,656 --> 00:53:49,046
sequence, which we set up in


1791
00:53:49,046 --> 00:53:52,036
Reality Composer down here,


1792
00:53:52,036 --> 00:53:53,726
which will scale each of our


1793
00:53:53,726 --> 00:53:55,146
celestial bodies back to their


1794
00:53:55,146 --> 00:53:56,656
original scale of 100%.


1795
00:53:57,836 --> 00:53:59,396
And when the size segmented


1796
00:53:59,396 --> 00:54:00,486
control is selected, we want to


1797
00:54:00,486 --> 00:54:02,426
scale our Sun to a relative size


1798
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:03,326
to the Earth.


1799
00:54:04,316 --> 00:54:06,486
To do that, we can fire our


1800
00:54:07,056 --> 00:54:09,686
scale to relative sizes action


1801
00:54:09,686 --> 00:54:10,156
sequence.


1802
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,676
And finally when the lesson


1803
00:54:12,676 --> 00:54:14,476
completed button is tapped, this


1804
00:54:14,476 --> 00:54:15,576
is an Interface Builder action


1805
00:54:15,576 --> 00:54:17,386
that we've set up and hooked up,


1806
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,956
we'll fire the chapter completed


1807
00:54:21,286 --> 00:54:22,206
Notification Trigger.


1808
00:54:22,936 --> 00:54:24,536
And what this one does is


1809
00:54:24,536 --> 00:54:25,756
because there are three


1810
00:54:25,756 --> 00:54:27,096
different Notification Triggers


1811
00:54:27,206 --> 00:54:28,506
hooked up in Reality Composer,


1812
00:54:28,876 --> 00:54:30,156
we'll fire all three of these


1813
00:54:30,156 --> 00:54:31,046
action sequences.


1814
00:54:31,456 --> 00:54:32,736
We'll fade out the existing


1815
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:33,196
content.


1816
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:36,276
We'll then begin an orbit of our


1817
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:37,446
little Earth and little Moon.


1818
00:54:38,006 --> 00:54:40,686
And we'll show the chapter


1819
00:54:40,686 --> 00:54:41,756
completed section.


1820
00:54:42,266 --> 00:54:46,346
So, let's run this now and see


1821
00:54:46,346 --> 00:54:46,906
our application.


1822
00:54:50,876 --> 00:54:51,956
All right, so here we have our


1823
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:52,366
content.


1824
00:54:52,926 --> 00:54:54,296
We can tap on the Moon.


1825
00:54:54,296 --> 00:54:55,676
Everything works exactly the


1826
00:54:55,676 --> 00:54:56,826
same as we set up in Reality


1827
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:57,326
Composer.


1828
00:54:57,566 --> 00:54:59,146
And now when we tap the size


1829
00:54:59,146 --> 00:55:00,426
segmented control when looking


1830
00:55:00,426 --> 00:55:01,996
at the Earth and the Sun, we get


1831
00:55:01,996 --> 00:55:03,986
a really good scale of just how


1832
00:55:03,986 --> 00:55:05,756
big the Sun is compared to


1833
00:55:05,756 --> 00:55:05,966
Earth.


1834
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:06,956
It's pretty tiny.


1835
00:55:07,556 --> 00:55:09,466
So, that looks great.


1836
00:55:09,616 --> 00:55:11,596
Let's size it back, and let's


1837
00:55:11,596 --> 00:55:12,346
complete our lesson.


1838
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:13,526
I'm going to tap the lesson


1839
00:55:13,526 --> 00:55:14,666
completed, the complete lesson


1840
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:15,716
button at the top right-hand


1841
00:55:15,716 --> 00:55:16,026
corner.


1842
00:55:16,686 --> 00:55:18,306
And we'll see our content fades


1843
00:55:18,306 --> 00:55:19,836
out, and we see our chapter


1844
00:55:19,836 --> 00:55:22,086
completed along with an orbit


1845
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:23,186
starting for our tiny Sun.


1846
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:24,936
That looks pretty great, and we


1847
00:55:24,936 --> 00:55:26,486
can see how with Notification


1848
00:55:26,486 --> 00:55:28,576
Triggers and Notify Actions, we


1849
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:29,876
can work with our application


1850
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:30,936
and our AR content.


1851
00:55:31,226 --> 00:55:32,276
There's one last thing I want to


1852
00:55:32,276 --> 00:55:32,446
do.


1853
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:33,676
We discussed post with


1854
00:55:33,676 --> 00:55:35,076
overrides, and I want to show


1855
00:55:35,076 --> 00:55:36,146
you how we can use that to


1856
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:37,656
display dynamic content using


1857
00:55:37,656 --> 00:55:38,436
application state.


1858
00:55:39,116 --> 00:55:40,196
So because this is a lesson


1859
00:55:40,196 --> 00:55:41,606
application, we want to display


1860
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:43,146
gold stars based on how well a


1861
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:44,426
student does.


1862
00:55:46,986 --> 00:55:48,476
For this session, I think we all


1863
00:55:48,476 --> 00:55:49,406
did pretty great so I'm just


1864
00:55:49,406 --> 00:55:50,346
going to give us three stars,


1865
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,566
and we can see how we can set


1866
00:55:51,566 --> 00:55:51,956
this up.


1867
00:55:52,546 --> 00:55:53,576
This is a method that we're


1868
00:55:53,576 --> 00:55:55,826
calling inside of our display


1869
00:55:55,826 --> 00:55:58,316
details view up above where


1870
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,176
we're keeping state.


1871
00:55:59,726 --> 00:56:02,896
So this looks like a lot of code


1872
00:56:02,896 --> 00:56:03,986
that I just pasted in, but let's


1873
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:04,506
walk through it.


1874
00:56:05,366 --> 00:56:06,396
So the first thing we're doing


1875
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,496
is accessing our special star


1876
00:56:08,496 --> 00:56:09,756
entity that we set up in Reality


1877
00:56:09,756 --> 00:56:12,056
Composer right here.


1878
00:56:12,276 --> 00:56:15,966
We've given it the name special


1879
00:56:15,966 --> 00:56:17,196
star, so we're now accessing it


1880
00:56:17,566 --> 00:56:18,336
right in Xcode.


1881
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:21,016
Next, we're triggering the show


1882
00:56:21,016 --> 00:56:23,826
gold star action sequence right


1883
00:56:23,826 --> 00:56:25,336
in code, so that will display


1884
00:56:25,336 --> 00:56:26,286
the first gold star.


1885
00:56:26,286 --> 00:56:27,556
But we want to display three.


1886
00:56:28,216 --> 00:56:29,806
So, we can do that by


1887
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,576
dispatching after maybe two and


1888
00:56:31,576 --> 00:56:33,216
a half seconds for this demo,


1889
00:56:33,636 --> 00:56:34,996
and we're going to clone the


1890
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:35,446
star.


1891
00:56:36,456 --> 00:56:37,496
Then we're going to position it


1892
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,926
to the right and up a little


1893
00:56:39,926 --> 00:56:40,236
bit.


1894
00:56:40,996 --> 00:56:41,776
We're going to add it to our


1895
00:56:41,776 --> 00:56:42,296
scene.


1896
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:45,096
And then using post overrides,


1897
00:56:45,096 --> 00:56:46,296
we're passing in the original


1898
00:56:46,296 --> 00:56:47,696
target of the action sequence,


1899
00:56:47,996 --> 00:56:50,006
and then passing in the new


1900
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,556
action, the new target of the


1901
00:56:51,556 --> 00:56:52,696
action, in this case the right


1902
00:56:52,696 --> 00:56:53,056
star.


1903
00:56:53,296 --> 00:56:55,266
And we want to do the same thing


1904
00:56:55,266 --> 00:56:55,986
for the left star.


1905
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:57,036
So, we're copying it again,


1906
00:56:57,556 --> 00:56:58,266
copying the star.


1907
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,476
Positioning it to the left and


1908
00:57:00,476 --> 00:57:02,686
down a little bit, adding it to


1909
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:04,336
our scene, and again, posting


1910
00:57:04,336 --> 00:57:05,756
with overrides, taking the


1911
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,316
original name and passing in the


1912
00:57:07,316 --> 00:57:08,806
left star this time as the


1913
00:57:09,036 --> 00:57:10,576
target of our action sequence.


1914
00:57:11,856 --> 00:57:12,916
So, let's build and run this app


1915
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:13,956
now, and what we'd like to see


1916
00:57:13,956 --> 00:57:15,686
is three gold stars appear, even


1917
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:16,916
though we've only set up one in


1918
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:17,646
our application.


1919
00:57:17,776 --> 00:57:18,876
This is driven entirely by


1920
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:19,656
application logic.


1921
00:57:25,456 --> 00:57:26,786
So here's our scene again.


1922
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:28,476
We can walk through the lesson.


1923
00:57:29,136 --> 00:57:31,376
I think I'm done now, so I'll


1924
00:57:31,976 --> 00:57:33,786
click complete lesson.


1925
00:57:34,236 --> 00:57:35,466
And we see one gold star


1926
00:57:35,466 --> 00:57:36,006
appears.


1927
00:57:36,736 --> 00:57:37,946
We'll see a second gold star


1928
00:57:37,946 --> 00:57:38,466
appears.


1929
00:57:38,946 --> 00:57:40,146
And there's our third star.


1930
00:57:40,146 --> 00:57:41,206
We did a great job, so we got


1931
00:57:41,206 --> 00:57:41,816
three stars here.

1933
00:57:51,436 --> 00:57:53,106
So, that's how easy it is to


1934
00:57:53,106 --> 00:57:54,696
load your AR content into your


1935
00:57:54,696 --> 00:57:56,936
application, begin working with


1936
00:57:56,936 --> 00:57:58,326
it with notify actions to


1937
00:57:58,326 --> 00:57:59,156
provide your custom own


1938
00:57:59,156 --> 00:58:00,616
implementations, and then


1939
00:58:00,616 --> 00:58:02,296
Trigger Action sequences that


1940
00:58:02,296 --> 00:58:03,566
you set up in Reality Composer


1941
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:05,276
using Notification Triggers.


1942
00:58:05,436 --> 00:58:08,336
So, let's take a tour of what we


1943
00:58:08,336 --> 00:58:08,866
learned today.


1944
00:58:09,026 --> 00:58:10,366
We learned with Reality Composer


1945
00:58:10,366 --> 00:58:11,906
we can create amazing AR


1946
00:58:11,906 --> 00:58:14,036
experiences using the built-in


1947
00:58:14,146 --> 00:58:15,766
modular assets, for example the


1948
00:58:15,766 --> 00:58:17,166
sphere or the cube.


1949
00:58:17,506 --> 00:58:18,896
And then we can bring those


1950
00:58:18,896 --> 00:58:20,776
assets to life with behaviors


1951
00:58:21,096 --> 00:58:23,506
and simple interactions.


1952
00:58:24,616 --> 00:58:25,606
Finally, we can bring those


1953
00:58:25,606 --> 00:58:27,536
amazing AR experiences into our


1954
00:58:27,536 --> 00:58:29,146
applications using code


1955
00:58:29,146 --> 00:58:30,546
generation and deep integration


1956
00:58:30,546 --> 00:58:31,056
with Xcode.


1957
00:58:31,256 --> 00:58:32,646
We have already seen some


1958
00:58:32,646 --> 00:58:34,206
amazing stuff being created by


1959
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:36,206
you guys using Reality Composer.


1960
00:58:36,506 --> 00:58:37,916
We encourage you guys to keep


1961
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:38,326
creating.


1962
00:58:38,326 --> 00:58:39,996
We're super excited to see the


1963
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:41,686
amazing AR applications that you


1964
00:58:41,686 --> 00:58:42,246
can create.


1965
00:58:43,126 --> 00:58:44,876
We have some sessions and labs


1966
00:58:44,876 --> 00:58:46,796
available to you guys today and


1967
00:58:46,796 --> 00:58:49,076
tomorrow, and we encourage you


1968
00:58:49,076 --> 00:58:50,046
guys to bring questions, your


1969
00:58:50,046 --> 00:58:51,426
projects, anything else, we're


1970
00:58:51,426 --> 00:58:52,146
happy to help you.


1971
00:58:52,646 --> 00:58:54,956
Have a great rest of your WWDC.


1972
00:58:54,956 --> 00:58:55,976
Thank you.
