00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,086
employees, as well as other


198
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:10,476
companies.


199
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:12,596
And this fall, we're bringing


200
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:16,416
custom apps to ASM, as well.


201
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:17,856
Speaking -- yes, thank you.


202
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:20,876
[ Applause ]


203
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:22,616
And speaking of accounts,


204
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:24,066
earlier this spring, we added


205
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,576
Federated authentication with


206
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,536
Microsoft Azure Active Directory


207
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,756
to ASM, and this fall, we're


208
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:31,456
bringing that feature to ABM.


209
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:32,746
I am -- okay.


210
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,766
[ Applause ]


211
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:35,546
I love you guys.


212
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:36,496
This is a great audience.


213
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:39,356
I'm also very pleased to


214
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:40,896
announce that as of this week,


215
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:43,296
both ABM and ASM are now fully


216
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:45,156
supported on iPad on the


217
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:45,976
shipping iOS.


218
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:48,546
[ Applause and Cheers ]


219
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,026
We love iPad, too.


220
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:52,956
Again, making sure that you can


221
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:55,656
use these services and apps on


222
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,876
all of our platforms.


223
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:59,566
In fact, ABM and ASM have been


224
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:01,336
so successful that we are ending


225
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:02,696
support for their predecessor,


226
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,026
Apple Deployment Programs, at


227
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:04,916
the end of this year.


228
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:06,856
It's time to get on board with


229
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:07,496
ABM and ASM.


230
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:10,126
Because, in fact, you're getting


231
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:12,976
even more benefits now with the


232
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:14,646
same Managed Apple ID you use to


233
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:16,816
sign in to ABM and ASM, you get


234
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:18,506
access to the AppleSeed for IT,


235
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,366
so that you can get all of the


236
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:21,986
new beta software releases, like


237
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:23,376
everything we seeded this week,


238
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:25,446
including documentation and test


239
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:26,916
plans, to help you ensure that


240
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,626
those new software releases will


241
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:30,496
work well in your organization,


242
00:06:30,946 --> 00:06:32,536
and when you find some things


243
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:34,396
you don't particularly like, use


244
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:35,676
Feedback Assistant built into


245
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:38,256
all of our OSs now to file


246
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:39,836
suggestions to us, so that we


247
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:41,436
can associate those with your


248
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:43,076
organization and more accurately


249
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:44,126
track them in engineering.


250
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:47,556
That concludes our update on ABM


251
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:49,246
and ASM, and now I'd like to


252
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:50,766
turn to another great example of


253
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:52,336
how we provide you with the same


254
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:53,706
tools on every platform and


255
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:54,776
allow you to choose the best


256
00:06:54,776 --> 00:06:55,626
devices for you.


257
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,026
And that's Classroom.


258
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:00,786
In March, we released the latest


259
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:03,106
update to Classroom for iPad and


260
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:05,446
Mac, but now it enables teachers


261
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:06,876
to manage student Macs with the


262
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,206
same great feature set that


263
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:09,536
they've grown to love while


264
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:10,836
managing student iPads.


265
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:12,826
On the left, you can see that


266
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:14,076
students can manage their


267
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:15,496
classes with a new classroom


268
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:17,336
pane in system preferences, just


269
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,546
like they do in settings on


270
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:19,486
iPad.


271
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:21,986
And we also brought all of the


272
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:23,716
settings that configure certain


273
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:25,306
classroom behaviors that you


274
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:27,346
have on iOS back to macOS,


275
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,986
including the ones that control


276
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,566
Classroom's Screensview feature.


277
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,476
But we didn't stop there.


278
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:34,956
We also made all of the other


279
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,356
screen viewing features that you


280
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,096
know and love in macOS from


281
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:39,916
screen sharing, screenshot, and


282
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,936
Apple Note desktop respect those


283
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:44,446
restrictions, as well.


284
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:46,656
Earlier this week, we seeded our


285
00:07:46,656 --> 00:07:48,476
fall release of Classroom, which


286
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:49,836
of course, support Dark Mode on


287
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:50,876
iOS 13.


288
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:53,526
And we've and a great new


289
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:54,886
feature that will help teachers


290
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:56,866
regain student attention without


291
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:58,956
needing to lock the device, we


292
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:00,556
call it Hide Apps, and it works


293
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:00,796
like this.


294
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:03,046
When the teacher taps the new


295
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:04,776
Hide button in the toolbar, the


296
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:05,886
student is returned to home


297
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,666
screen on their iPad.


298
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,326
That concludes our Classroom


299
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:10,826
update.


300
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:12,066
Now I'd like to turn to a couple


301
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:12,956
of other announcements that


302
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:14,166
impact device management.


303
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,166
We all saw on Monday the


304
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,456
announcement of desktop-class


305
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:19,536
browsing on iPad.


306
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,206
This may impact your MDM product


307
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,146
if you are using the UserAgent


308
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:25,336
string to distinguish between


309
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:28,056
iPad and Mac to customize your


310
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:29,306
UI or your enrollment flow.


311
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:30,516
You're going to need to stop


312
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:32,535
doing that, because iPad now


313
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:33,366
identifies as Mac.


314
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:36,126
For more about this great new


315
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:37,686
feature for iPad, check out the


316
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:40,916
session from earlier this week.


317
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:42,446
We've also brought a number of


318
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:44,056
great device management features


319
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:47,086
custom to on iOS and macOS to


320
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,296
AppleTV, we now allow


321
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,676
organizations to control when


322
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:53,586
software updates appear in the


323
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:55,666
tvOS UI and allow you to


324
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,376
configure date and time


325
00:08:57,376 --> 00:08:58,086
automatically.


326
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:00,246
Hopefully, you're all using


327
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:01,256
content caching in your


328
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:02,996
organization, and now tvOS


329
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:04,716
screensavers are also cashed,


330
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,256
saving you a lot of bandwidth.


331
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:09,356
[ Applause ]


332
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:11,606
That concludes our first section


333
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:12,776
of content, and now I'd like to


334
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:14,426
turn to some features that help


335
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:15,686
us strike that right balance


336
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:18,026
between security, privacy, and


337
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:18,756
manageability.


338
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:21,636
And the first one is a really


339
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:23,496
big deal that Craig highlighted


340
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,026
in the keynote on Monday, I'd


341
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,396
like to ask Bob Whiteman to come


342
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:27,876
on stage and tell you all about


343
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:28,626
user enrollment.


344

[ Applause ]


345
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,536
>> Hi, I'm Bob Whiteman, Senior


346
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:39,186
Device Management Engineer at


347
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:39,856
Apple.


348
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:41,226
Until now, there have been two


349
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:42,806
ways to manage iOS devices.


350
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:44,856
Device enrollments provide many


351
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:45,836
device-wide management


352
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,656
capabilities, and for


353
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:49,046
institutionally owned devices


354
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,756
that are supervised, automated


355
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,706
device enrollment provides all


356
00:09:52,706 --> 00:09:53,526
of the device management


357
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,596
capabilities as well as


358
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:56,686
automated set up.


359
00:09:57,886 --> 00:09:59,096
When users bring their personal


360
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:01,066
devices to work or school, they


361
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,756
don't really want the admin to


362
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:04,736
manage the entire device, and


363
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,386
BYOD admins don't really want to


364
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:07,836
manage the entire device either.


365
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:09,146
They just want to provide the


366
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:11,066
apps, data, and configuration


367
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:12,656
that users need in order to be


368
00:10:12,656 --> 00:10:13,216
productive.


369
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:15,606
Today, I'm presenting a new way


370
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:17,556
to manage BYOD devices called


371
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:18,656
User Enrollments.


372
00:10:19,506 --> 00:10:23,306
This is a new MDM enrollment


373
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:25,346
option that provides a better


374
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:26,476
balance for BYOD.


375
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,236
It protects the privacy of


376
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:29,786
personal data, while still


377
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:31,056
securing corporate data.


378
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:33,716
When users and admins achieve


379
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,126
this better balance, there is


380
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:36,896
greater acceptance of BYOD


381
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:38,936
programs, and more productive


382
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:39,436
users.


383
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:40,946
Everyone wins.


384
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:43,096
User enrollments are built on


385
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:43,956
three pillars.


386
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:46,036
The first is a Managed Apple ID,


387
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:47,796
alongside the Personal Apple ID.


388
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:50,076
The second is cryptographic


389
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:52,676
separation of personal and work


390
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,866
data, and the third is a limited


391
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:56,546
set of device-wide management


392
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:57,356
capabilities.


393
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:01,586
A Managed Apple ID is required


394
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:02,586
for user enrollment.


395
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:04,256
This is the anchor for the


396
00:11:04,256 --> 00:11:06,246
user's work identity on the


397
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:06,796
device.


398
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:08,626
Now this is not a multiuser


399
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,056
system.


400
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:10,736
It's a multi- persona system.


401
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,256
It's the same user wearing


402
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,106
different hats.


403
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:15,756
The admin creates the Managed


404
00:11:15,756 --> 00:11:17,746
Apple ID in Apple School Manager


405
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:19,136
or Apple Business Manager, and


406
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:21,096
the user must sign into the


407
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,646
Managed Apple ID during the


408
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:23,886
enrollment process.


409
00:11:24,876 --> 00:11:26,416
Federated off means that this


410
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,816
works very well for the user,


411
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:28,886
since they are challenged for


412
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:29,936
credentials that they already


413
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:31,296
know from the organization.


414
00:11:32,086 --> 00:11:33,436
And when the enrollment ends,


415
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:35,656
the Managed Apple ID is removed


416
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:38,376
from the device.


417
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:40,386
Managed Apps and Accounts use


418
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:41,896
the Managed Apple ID's iCloud


419
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:44,206
account and Personal Apps and


420
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:45,886
Accounts use the personal Apple


421
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:47,436
ID's iCloud account, if there is


422
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:48,236
one signed in.


423
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:50,866
Third-party apps are always


424
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:52,496
entirely either managed or


425
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:53,106
unmanaged.


426
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:54,476
They can't change mode, and you


427
00:11:54,476 --> 00:11:56,056
can't run them in both modes at


428
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:56,706
the same time.


429
00:11:57,756 --> 00:11:59,426
Some of the built-in apps like


430
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:01,576
Notes, our account based, which


431
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:02,686
means they can handle both


432
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,456
managed accounts and unmanaged


433
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,056
accounts, and these apps will


434
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:07,646
use the appropriate Apple ID,


435
00:12:07,646 --> 00:12:08,846
depending on which account they


436
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:11,986
are operating on at the time.


437
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:13,416
The next pillar is data


438
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,026
separation.


439
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:16,476
When the enrollment starts, iOS


440
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:18,906
creates a managed APFS volume,


441
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:20,106
and it uses separate


442
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,506
cryptographic keys for this.


443
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:23,906
When enrollment ends, iOS


444
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:25,476
destroys the cryptographic keys


445
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:26,366
and the volume.


446
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:27,656
So, the data is gone.


447
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:29,596
Now it's always been the case


448
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:31,286
that iOS removes managed data


449
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:32,256
when enrollment ends


450
00:12:32,256 --> 00:12:32,986
appropriately.


451
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:34,916
So, this is a cryptographic


452
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,196
backstop to make sure that the


453
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:38,106
data is provably gone, just in


454
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:39,226
case something goes wrong during


455
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,386
the unenrollment process.


456
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,956
The managed APFS volume contains


457
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:45,686
the managed versions of all of


458
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:46,416
these items.


459
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:48,856
App containers are any local


460
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:50,776
data stored by third-party apps.


461
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:53,636
The Notes app stores local data


462
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:55,436
for managed Notes accounts on


463
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:57,616
the managed APFS volume and for


464
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:59,336
personal notes accounts on the


465
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:01,656
personal or system APFS volume.


466
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:05,166
When iOS creates this managed


467
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,476
APFS volume, it also creates a


468
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:08,476
managed keychain.


469
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:10,936
This stores any secure items


470
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:12,536
that are saved by third-party


471
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:13,806
apps like passwords and


472
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,986
certificates, and it also stores


473
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:17,566
the authentication credentials


474
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:19,306
for managed accounts.


475
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:22,206
Mail attachments and full email


476
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,156
bodies are stored on the managed


477
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:27,326
APFS partition, although there


478
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:28,876
is a central database for mail


479
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:30,206
that lives on the system


480
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:31,606
partition that contains some


481
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:33,616
metadata and five-line previews.


482
00:13:34,036 --> 00:13:35,216
Rest assured, this data is


483
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:36,436
removed when the enrollment


484
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:36,846
ends.


485
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:42,526
Once the data is separated, the


486
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:44,606
management of this data must be


487
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:45,606
separated, as well.


488
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,396
User enrollments have a few


489
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:49,026
limited capabilities for


490
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:50,516
managing the entire device, but


491
00:13:50,516 --> 00:13:52,016
they have no capabilities for


492
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,726
managing personal apps and data.


493
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:56,736
User enrollment management is


494
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:58,726
based upon a modified version of


495
00:13:58,726 --> 00:13:59,916
the MDM protocol.


496
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,786
And it starts the same way as


497
00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:03,956
device enrollments, with the


498
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:05,486
enrollment profile.


499
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:10,866
The Managed Apple ID key is what


500
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:12,326
signifies this as a user


501
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:12,856
enrollment.


502
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,396
And the value of this is the


503
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,026
user name of the managed Apple


504
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,796
ID that the user must sign into.


505
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:20,516
There's also a payload


506
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:21,606
organization key.


507
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:22,846
This is an existing key for


508
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:24,166
device enrollments, but becomes


509
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:26,006
particularly useful for user


510
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:26,896
enrollments, because this


511
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:28,556
identifies the managed accounts


512
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:29,216
on the device.


513
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:31,576
It will appear in Settings and


514
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:32,656
in the Notes app and some other


515
00:14:32,656 --> 00:14:33,196
places.


516
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:35,286
And also note that there's no


517
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:36,776
access rights key here.


518
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:38,856
Device enrollments use access


519
00:14:38,856 --> 00:14:39,926
rights to gate certain


520
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,846
management capabilities for


521
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:43,206
device enrollments, but these


522
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:44,456
simply don't apply to the user


523
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:44,876
enrollments.


524
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:45,936
So, they're not specified.


525
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:49,806
There's more differences between


526
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,996
the device enrollment protocol


527
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:52,236
and the user enrollment protocol


528
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:52,946
than I go to can go through


529
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,086
here, but I will cover the most


530
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:54,816
important points.


531
00:14:55,576 --> 00:14:57,426
First of all, profile service


532
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:59,186
profiles and user enrollments do


533
00:14:59,186 --> 00:14:59,766
not mix.


534
00:14:59,886 --> 00:15:01,456
You cannot use them to enroll,


535
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,016
and you can install one via a


536
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:03,806
user enrollment.


537
00:15:05,576 --> 00:15:07,536
Device enrollments use the UDID


538
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,096
as the primary identifier of the


539
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:10,526
device that is communicating.


540
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:13,706
User enrollments do not provide


541
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:15,476
UDID or any other persistent


542
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:17,086
identifier to the MDM server.


543
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:18,586
This includes serial number,


544
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,536
IMEI, MEID.


545
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:22,976
Instead, when enrollment starts,


546
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:25,216
iOS creates and enrollment ID,


547
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,136
and this is communicated to the


548
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:28,916
MDM server in all MDM


549
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:29,736
communications.


550
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:32,656
The MDM server can use this as


551
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:34,096
its primary identifier for the


552
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:34,616
enrollment.


553
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:37,026
And when the enrollment ends,


554
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,616
iOS destroys this enrollment ID.


555
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:40,886
So, if the same device enrolls


556
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:42,506
again, it will get a different


557
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:43,466
enrollment ID.


558
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:45,756
There's something similar for


559
00:15:45,756 --> 00:15:46,466
ActiveSync.


560
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:49,746
When a user enrollment installs


561
00:15:49,746 --> 00:15:51,496
an exchange account, that goes


562
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:53,016
into a user enrollment mode.


563
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:57,676
It uses a EAS device identifier


564
00:15:57,896 --> 00:15:59,136
that was generated at the start


565
00:15:59,136 --> 00:15:59,986
of the enrollment, and it


566
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:01,616
communicates it both to the


567
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,426
exchange server and to the MDM


568
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:04,946
server in the device information


569
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:06,096
query, so, they can use that to


570
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:07,416
correlate as they usually do.


571
00:16:08,006 --> 00:16:09,266
And again, this is destroyed


572
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:10,316
when the enrollment ends.


573
00:16:11,786 --> 00:16:13,906
And the token update command


574
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,876
does not include the unlock


575
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:16,326
token.


576
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:17,916
This means that the MDM server


577
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,236
cannot clear the device


578
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:19,826
passcode.


579
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:24,436
One of the top reasons why users


580
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:26,826
reject BYOD programs is because


581
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:27,776
they are concerned that the


582
00:16:27,776 --> 00:16:29,486
admin may erase the entire


583
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:30,616
device, and they will lose their


584
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:31,836
personal data on their own


585
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:32,296
device.


586
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:34,016
User enrollments do not the


587
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:35,706
support Erase Device command.


588
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:40,086
[ Applause ]


589
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:42,586
And there's a similar thing for


590
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:43,306
ActiveSync.


591
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,316
If the exchange account is in


592
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:46,746
user enrollment mode, the


593
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:48,236
exchange server cannot send the


594
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:49,226
RemoteWipe command.


595
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:51,796
Instead, the MDM server can end


596
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:54,046
the enrollment, and the exchange


597
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,636
server can send the Account-only


598
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:57,276
RemoteWipe, which only remove


599
00:16:57,276 --> 00:16:59,186
managed data in leave personal


600
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:01,176
data untouched.


601
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:03,836
Some queries will only return


602
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:05,296
the managed results.


603
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:07,016
So, for instance, the MDM server


604
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:08,646
cannot find out what personal


605
00:17:08,816 --> 00:17:09,786
apps are installed on the


606
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:10,256
device.


607
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:12,266
This is one place where we've


608
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:13,665
added a new feature for device


609
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,256
enrollments.


610
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,486
They have a new managed-only key


611
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:18,346
that filters the results in the


612
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:19,596
same way.


613
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:24,516
When installing applications,


614
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:26,165
user enrollments cannot take


615
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:27,935
over or abandon management of an


616
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:28,026
app.


617
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,496
The app is always removed when


618
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:31,386
the enrollment ends.


619
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:33,026
User enrollments support


620
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:35,706
enterprise app distribution, and


621
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:36,926
user-based VPP with


622
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:37,986
PurchaseMethod 1.


623
00:17:38,386 --> 00:17:40,056
This ensures that the purchase


624
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:41,616
goes on the managed Apple ID,


625
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:43,986
not the personal Apple ID.


626
00:17:46,636 --> 00:17:48,696
For VPN, user enrollments


627
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:50,206
support the Per-app VPN, and


628
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:51,496
we've expanded it with some new


629
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:51,986
keys.


630
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:54,726
These keys help guide the


631
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:56,006
traffic for the related


632
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,416
protocols through the Per-app


633
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:57,666
VPN.


634
00:17:58,376 --> 00:17:59,506
These are also available for


635
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:01,976
device enrollments, but for user


636
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:02,926
enrollments, there's a very


637
00:18:02,926 --> 00:18:04,406
important limitation on these,


638
00:18:04,406 --> 00:18:06,316
which is that the second-level


639
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:08,536
domain of the VPN server must


640
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:10,586
match the second-level domain in


641
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:11,826
the values for these keys.


642
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:14,246
So, for instance, if the VPN


643
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:18,016
server is VPN.acme.com, the mail


644
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:19,276
domains can include


645
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:21,816
mail.acme.com, but they cannot


646
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:23,886
include mail.aol.com.


647
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,566
This ensures that only the


648
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,156
managed accounts are guided


649
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:28,546
through the Per-app VPN.


650
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:31,976
If a user enrollment installs a


651
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:34,026
passcode policy, iOS will


652
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:35,976
enforce a six-digit not simple


653
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:36,586
passcode.


654
00:18:39,396 --> 00:18:41,246
And it does not support more


655
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,796
complex passcode requirements.


656
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:44,366
The main reason for this is


657
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:47,126
because a more complex passcode


658
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,586
requirement increases the risk


659
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,726
that the user will forget the


660
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:53,056
passcode, and the MDM server


661
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,296
can't help out the user in this


662
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:55,536
case by clearing the passcode.


663
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:56,796
So, it would be unfair to


664
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:57,756
require this.


665
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:00,296
For more information on why this


666
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:02,196
is the sweet spot for passcode


667
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:03,656
policies, I suggest reading the


668
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:05,556
latest edition of iOS security


669
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:06,046
document.


670
00:19:07,086 --> 00:19:09,036
If you need proxying for Wi-Fi,


671
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,016
use WPAD configured on the


672
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:11,736
access points.


673
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:13,426
The Wi-Fi payload does not


674
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:15,066
support any of the proxy keys.


675
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:17,746
And defaults in logging payloads


676
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:18,746
are not supported.


677
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:21,746
Now these are very useful for


678
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,256
troubleshooting or for reporting


679
00:19:23,256 --> 00:19:25,176
issues to Apple, and they can be


680
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:26,776
installed, but it must be done


681
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:27,536
by the user.


682
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,996
So that they have a chance to


683
00:19:28,996 --> 00:19:30,536
accept the changes that these


684
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,676
will make to their personal


685
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:34,616
device.


686
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,036
User enrollments do support some


687
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:36,726
restrictions.


688
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:38,516
Managed Open In is available,


689
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:40,166
and the allowLockScreen


690
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,696
restrictions are there, so that


691
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:43,256
managed data does not appear on


692
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:43,866
the lock screen.


693
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:47,166
But it doesn't support any of


694
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,116
the supervised-only


695
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:49,696
restrictions, and it doesn't


696
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:51,336
support any of the restrictions


697
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:52,366
that really have nothing to do


698
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:54,386
with managed data like content


699
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:55,786
ratings or ones that turn off


700
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:57,216
major features like iCloud.


701
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:00,136
These also apply to their


702
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:01,586
ActiveSync equivalents when an


703
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:02,966
exchange account is in user


704
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:03,596
enrollment mode.


705
00:20:04,846 --> 00:20:06,206
And I have an important warning


706
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:08,006
for MDM server developers.


707
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:10,166
Make sure that your server is


708
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,266
resilient to unexpected or


709
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:14,426
absent keys and the results, as


710
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:16,666
these capabilities are going to


711
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:16,976
change over time.


712
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:21,256
Now I'd like to welcome my


713
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:22,726
colleague Ren to the stage to


714
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:24,056
demonstrate the user enrollment.


715
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:24,586
Ren?


716
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:30,006
[ Applause ]


717
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:30,986
>> Thanks Bob.


718
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,126
>> All right, hi everyone.


719
00:20:42,336 --> 00:20:43,996
My name is Ren, and today, I'm


720
00:20:43,996 --> 00:20:45,216
going to demo the user


721
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:45,856
enrollment flow.


722
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:47,796
Just like device enrollment,


723
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:49,716
user enrollment starts with the


724
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:50,606
profile, as well.


725
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:53,066
To get that profile, today I'm


726
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:54,996
going to go to an actual website


727
00:20:55,196 --> 00:20:56,766
of a company called Acme Inc.


728
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:01,176
This is the website, and please


729
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,336
be aware that this is just a


730
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,096
demo website.


731
00:21:04,516 --> 00:21:05,606
In the real world, you might


732
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:07,036
have to authenticate first to


733
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:08,106
download anything.


734
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,046
But we skipped that step in this


735
00:21:10,366 --> 00:21:10,636
demo.


736
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:14,076
And as Bob has said, user


737
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:16,006
enrollment works very closely


738
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,556
with the Managed Apple ID.


739
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,826
So, I will have to provide this


740
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:21,716
ID information to this website


741
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,436
to have it download, or


742
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:24,966
generate, a profile for me.


743
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:28,426
Let me paste in the username and


744
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:29,436
type on the enroll button.


745
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:32,866
Read the warning carefully, and


746
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:34,206
now, the profile has been


747
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:35,326
downloaded to my phone.


748
00:21:35,716 --> 00:21:37,966
Let's go to Settings to check it


749
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:39,266
out.


750
00:21:39,536 --> 00:21:41,076
After opening Settings, who will


751
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:42,896
notice that a new cell with


752
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:44,966
text, "Enroll in Acme Inc.," has


753
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:46,366
been added to this page.


754
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:48,546
And that is the shortcut to


755
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:50,756
start user enrollment, and I'm


756
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:54,216
going to take it now.


757
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:56,376
This is a new UI we made for


758
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:57,086
user enrollment.


759
00:21:57,766 --> 00:21:59,056
We merged the profile's


760
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:00,636
basic information, the


761
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,676
warning, and consent all into


762
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:03,306
one page.


763
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:05,206
We hope this will make your


764
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:06,666
profile installation experience


765
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:07,646
much smoother.


766
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:10,526
Also, if you want to dig more


767
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:11,746
into the details of this


768
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:13,566
profile, you can do that by


769
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,266
tapping on the Details button at


770
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:15,866
the top right.


771
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:19,656
Let's take a look at the MDM


772
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:21,206
payload of this profile.


773
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:24,566
And you will notice that the


774
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:27,046
managed Apple ID I provided at


775
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,946
the website has been added to


776
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:30,906
this payload, and this is the


777
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:32,396
key to trigger user enrollment.


778
00:22:33,156 --> 00:22:35,156
Also, we removed the Access


779
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:36,226
Rights section from this


780
00:22:36,226 --> 00:22:38,056
payload, because it's not needed


781
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,056
with user enrollment.


782
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:41,266
Something that you might not


783
00:22:41,266 --> 00:22:43,646
have noticed is if you go back


784
00:22:43,756 --> 00:22:45,076
to the top-level page of this


785
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,476
profile, you won't find any


786
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:48,956
warning talking about the things


787
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:50,676
the company can do to the


788
00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:52,176
employee's -- this device.


789
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:54,396
And that is because, as Bob has


790
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:55,986
mentioned, we carefully


791
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:58,826
restricted the capability of the


792
00:22:58,826 --> 00:22:59,356
MDM server.


793
00:22:59,696 --> 00:23:01,556
So, it won't be able to disturb


794
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:03,416
your personal user experience


795
00:23:03,646 --> 00:23:04,906
using your personal device.


796
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,896
Everything seems fine so far.


797
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:08,906
Let's continue profile


798
00:23:08,906 --> 00:23:10,756
installation by tapping on the


799
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,446
big rounded corner button on the


800
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:12,826
bottom.


801
00:23:13,446 --> 00:23:15,636
I will provide my device


802
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:19,586
password, and now I'm prompted


803
00:23:19,586 --> 00:23:21,276
to sign in this Managed Apple


804
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:21,526
ID.


805
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:23,556
So, depend on whether this


806
00:23:23,646 --> 00:23:26,046
account is Federated or not, the


807
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:27,276
UI you see here might be


808
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:28,046
slightly different.


809
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:29,746
Here I'm just using a


810
00:23:29,746 --> 00:23:31,476
non-Federated regular account.


811
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:33,266
So, I just have to type in my


812
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:36,416
password for this account, and


813
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:37,956
tap on sign in to continue.


814
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,786
Now, a bunch of things are


815
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:41,736
happening on the background.


816
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:44,046
We have created a separate disk


817
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:45,606
volume on this device for


818
00:23:45,606 --> 00:23:46,436
enterprise usage.


819
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,476
We are signing in this Managed


820
00:23:48,476 --> 00:23:49,986
Apple ID to this device and


821
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:51,886
enrolling this device into the


822
00:23:51,946 --> 00:23:52,566
MDM server.


823
00:23:53,396 --> 00:23:54,886
All these steps are tied


824
00:23:54,956 --> 00:23:56,976
together, so if either of them


825
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:58,486
failed, they will revert


826
00:23:58,516 --> 00:24:00,206
everything and pretend like


827
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,146
nothing has happened.


828
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:03,666
Now the user enrollment has


829
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:05,096
completed successfully.


830
00:24:05,536 --> 00:24:07,496
The MDM server can start sending


831
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:09,096
MDM commands like install


832
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:10,556
application, curate device


833
00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:11,926
information, etc., to this


834
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:12,266
device.


835
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:14,436
The pop-up you see now, it


836
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:15,796
actually came from the MDM


837
00:24:15,796 --> 00:24:18,306
server asking me to install an


838
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:19,136
app called Slack.


839
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,556
Let's approve it, and the


840
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:22,766
installation shall start


841
00:24:22,816 --> 00:24:23,276
shortly.


842
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:26,526
Another tip about user


843
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:28,266
enrollment is, if you want to


844
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,806
check out the account we just


845
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:31,576
signed in, you can do that by


846
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:35,316
going to Settings, Account and


847
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:36,766
Password -- Password and


848
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,996
Accounts, and you will find that


849
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:40,266
interface account there.


850
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:42,536
The same account has also been


851
00:24:42,536 --> 00:24:44,776
added to apps like Files and


852
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:46,306
Notes, and it's ready for you to


853
00:24:46,306 --> 00:24:46,566
use.


854
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,526
Let's take a look at the Files,


855
00:24:48,526 --> 00:24:49,226
for example.


856
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:52,426
After opening files, you will


857
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:54,536
notice that a new iCloud drive


858
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,396
with tag Enterprise has been


859
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:59,266
added to Files, and all your


860
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:00,996
enterprise data will be sent


861
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:02,416
through this iCloud drive.


862
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,726
All right that's it for demo.


863
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:06,186
Thanks for watching, and back to


864
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:06,546
you, Bob.


865
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:15,696
[ Applause ]


866
00:25:16,196 --> 00:25:17,516
>> User enrollments are also


867
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,836
supported on macOS.


868
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:20,866
They work with a Managed Apple


869
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:21,326
ID.


870
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:23,496
It creates a managed APFS


871
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:24,166
volume.


872
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,336
Notes data is fully separated


873
00:25:26,336 --> 00:25:27,386
between the volumes, depending


874
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:28,616
on the account, and the


875
00:25:28,616 --> 00:25:29,896
management capabilities are


876
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,546
similar to what I described for


877
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:32,896
iOS, although there are some


878
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:34,406
platform-specific differences.


879
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:37,116
This allows users to access the


880
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:39,376
same Managed Apple ID on their


881
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,556
personal iOS device and on their


882
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,326
Mac.


883
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:46,576
user enrollments provide a


884
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,156
better balance for BYOD.


885
00:25:48,156 --> 00:25:50,906
It's time to set a new agreement


886
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:52,656
between admins and their users.


887
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:54,626
Admins should evaluate user


888
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:56,536
enrollments, and they should


889
00:25:56,536 --> 00:25:58,066
reevaluate their security


890
00:25:58,066 --> 00:25:59,966
policies and shed some of these


891
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:01,396
outdated requirements that don't


892
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:03,226
make sense on modern devices.


893
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:05,906
Admins should provide a privacy


894
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:08,126
policy to protect and reassure


895
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:08,816
their users.


896
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:10,696
We think this is the best way to


897
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:12,516
bring BYOD devices into an


898
00:26:12,516 --> 00:26:13,096
organization.


899
00:26:13,626 --> 00:26:13,886
Thank you.


900
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:19,996
[ Applause ]


901
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,726
>> Thank you very much, Bob and


902
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:23,626
Ren, and now I'd like to take us


903
00:26:23,656 --> 00:26:25,206
through a couple of other topics


904
00:26:25,206 --> 00:26:27,026
related to balancing these


905
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:27,636
values.


906
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:29,146
The first, Certificate


907
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:30,866
Transparency, an important new


908
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:32,246
security enhancement that we


909
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:33,686
brought to all of our OSs last


910
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:34,126
December.


911
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:37,756
However, this can sometimes leak


912
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:39,046
internal host names to public


913
00:26:39,046 --> 00:26:40,576
logs that enterprises might be


914
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:41,286
concerned about.


915
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:43,166
So, at the same time, we added a


916
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:44,846
new payload, enabling them to


917
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:46,976
opt out specifically sensitive


918
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:48,856
certificates or domains, and


919
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:49,806
they can install as many


920
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:51,326
payloads as they need to manage


921
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:53,476
all of those sensitive items.


922
00:26:54,976 --> 00:26:56,966
We also added support for WPA3


923
00:26:56,966 --> 00:26:58,736
security type to the Wi-Fi


924
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,446
payload, including both personal


925
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:02,066
and enterprise authentication.


926
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:05,526
We also wanted to make it much


927
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:07,116
easier for MDM servers to use


928
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:08,456
the newer, more efficient push


929
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:10,676
API to communicate with all of


930
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:11,816
their enrolled devices.


931
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:13,856
So, we now support token-based


932
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:16,496
authentication for APNS.


933
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:20,106
Now this is not new.


934
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:21,536
We talked about this last year,


935
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:22,726
but this year, we're actually


936
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,096
enforcing that if you're using a


937
00:27:24,096 --> 00:27:26,406
device enrollment, those devices


938
00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:28,136
will be supervised and


939
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:29,436
enrollment will be mandatory.


940
00:27:30,376 --> 00:27:31,436
And this year, we're taking the


941
00:27:31,436 --> 00:27:32,986
opportunity to further deprecate


942
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,656
the allow pairing key, because


943
00:27:34,656 --> 00:27:36,186
that sets that value permanently


944
00:27:36,186 --> 00:27:37,186
at enrollment time.


945
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:39,386
Instead, we recommend using the


946
00:27:39,386 --> 00:27:41,026
existing configuration profile


947
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,306
restriction, which can be


948
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:43,366
changed at any time.


949
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:46,986
Now I'd like to turn to a number


950
00:27:46,986 --> 00:27:49,836
of macOS-specific topics related


951
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,176
to, again, mitigating the


952
00:27:51,176 --> 00:27:52,436
impacts of various security


953
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:53,856
improvements on manageability.


954
00:27:54,546 --> 00:27:55,736
The first, a security


955
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:57,426
improvement introduced in Mojave


956
00:27:57,546 --> 00:27:59,346
that made it more difficult to


957
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,846
enable remote management when


958
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:01,986
configuring new Macs.


959
00:28:02,706 --> 00:28:05,416
In macOS X.14.4, we added a pair


960
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:06,886
of new commands that enable you


961
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:08,786
to enable remote desktop


962
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:11,416
management via two MDM commands,


963
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:13,676
and they also configure the most


964
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:14,946
common options that you'll need


965
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:16,366
for ongoing management of those


966
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:17,876
Macs, using Remote Desktop.


967
00:28:20,636 --> 00:28:22,666
We also wanted to allow you to


968
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:24,536
use your mobile accounts with


969
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,836
Macs using FileVault.


970
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:27,846
So, there's a new capability


971
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:29,876
that MDM servers can manage a


972
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,086
new bootstrap token.


973
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:33,096
They asked the client Mac for


974
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:34,676
that token, and then escrow it


975
00:28:34,676 --> 00:28:35,676
themselves.


976
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:37,646
Then whenever a new user signs


977
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:39,426
in on that Mac, it will request


978
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,836
the bootstrap token from the MDM


979
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:42,556
server and use it to generate


980
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,036
the SecureToken needed to mount


981
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:45,336
the file systems and boot the


982
00:28:45,336 --> 00:28:45,466
Mac.


983
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,546
[ Applause ]


984
00:28:49,046 --> 00:28:50,186
We think this will great for


985
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,596
helping with password changes in


986
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,376
your organization.


987
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:55,996
Now the privacy policy payload


988
00:28:55,996 --> 00:28:58,226
is not new in Catalina, though


989
00:28:58,226 --> 00:28:59,906
it's also a great example of a


990
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,506
way that we help you mitigate


991
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,126
the impact of important security


992
00:29:03,126 --> 00:29:04,426
enhancements on your ability to


993
00:29:04,426 --> 00:29:06,316
manage Apple devices, and


994
00:29:06,316 --> 00:29:07,226
there's some new security


995
00:29:07,226 --> 00:29:08,926
enhancements in macOS Catalina


996
00:29:08,926 --> 00:29:10,516
that are now also configurable


997
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:11,436
using this policy.


998
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:13,606
For example, enabling keyloggers


999
00:29:13,606 --> 00:29:14,486
or screen recording in the


1000
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,806
background, or whitelisting your


1001
00:29:16,806 --> 00:29:18,046
internal apps that you don't


1002
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:19,716
want to notarize, so that they


1003
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,996
continue to run, even though


1004
00:29:20,996 --> 00:29:22,786
macOS Catalina requires that


1005
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:24,186
apps and text be notarized.


1006
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:29,866
Next, there is a new change that


1007
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:32,066
is new in macOS, Catalina,


1008
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:33,496
where, again, we're tweaking the


1009
00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:34,686
balance between security


1010
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:35,616
manageability.


1011
00:29:36,236 --> 00:29:38,476
Enabling FileVault via MDM now


1012
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:39,906
requires user-approved MDM


1013
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:41,816
enrollments, which means you can


1014
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:43,626
no longer pass off credentials


1015
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:45,286
on the command line's fdesetup.


1016
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,006
So, you should review your


1017
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:48,556
scripts and MDM agents if you


1018
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:50,196
have one in your MDM product, to


1019
00:29:50,196 --> 00:29:51,456
be prepared for this change.


1020
00:29:51,906 --> 00:29:54,676
Next, I think I heard there's


1021
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:55,976
been a lot of excitement about


1022
00:29:55,976 --> 00:29:57,426
Activation Lock coming to T2


1023
00:29:57,426 --> 00:29:58,906
Macs and macOS Catalina.


1024
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:00,096
So, of course, we made this


1025
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:02,096
manageable via MDM, just like


1026
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:02,336
iOS.


1027
00:30:03,156 --> 00:30:05,146
In fact, your MDM servers will


1028
00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:06,966
use the same endpoint in API as


1029
00:30:06,966 --> 00:30:07,216
iOS.


1030
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:09,846
Those APIs will be available


1031
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:11,226
soon, and service fully


1032
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,816
available later this summer.


1033
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:13,976
So, you can test your


1034
00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:15,406
implementation and have it ready


1035
00:30:15,406 --> 00:30:16,516
when that kept a Catalina ships


1036
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:17,186
later this fall.


1037
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,696
[ Applause ]


1038
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:24,976
It's a big deal.


1039
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:26,576
Again, a couple of changes to


1040
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:27,836
tweak that balance.


1041
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:29,646
We're deprecating in macOS


1042
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:31,216
Catalina, although all of these


1043
00:30:31,216 --> 00:30:32,316
capabilities will continue to


1044
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:34,746
work in Catalina, starting with


1045
00:30:34,746 --> 00:30:36,236
silent profile installation from


1046
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:37,016
the command line.


1047
00:30:38,316 --> 00:30:39,926
With Screen Time coming to macOS


1048
00:30:39,926 --> 00:30:41,736
and Catalina, we are deprecating


1049
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:43,386
path-based app black and


1050
00:30:43,386 --> 00:30:44,616
whitelists that are currently


1051
00:30:44,616 --> 00:30:45,906
configured using the parental


1052
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:47,356
controls application access


1053
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:47,816
payload.


1054
00:30:48,936 --> 00:30:50,456
And if your MDM server is still


1055
00:30:50,456 --> 00:30:52,286
using the outdated user channel


1056
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:53,836
only enrollments, you should


1057
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:54,626
move to the modern


1058
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:56,126
macOS-specific enrollments that


1059
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:57,326
are required for user


1060
00:30:57,326 --> 00:30:59,096
enrollments and also will be for


1061
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:00,686
any future enhancements to macOS


1062
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:01,596
device management.


1063
00:31:04,456 --> 00:31:05,916
Can we get a finely for the


1064
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:06,366
slide?


1065
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:08,336
I've been showing a version of


1066
00:31:08,336 --> 00:31:09,486
this for I don't want to say how


1067
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:10,846
many years, but this year, in


1068
00:31:11,026 --> 00:31:13,196
iOS 13 we will stop honoring the


1069
00:31:13,376 --> 00:31:14,886
list of restrictions created


1070
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:16,336
before supervision existed,


1071
00:31:16,536 --> 00:31:17,306
which really should be


1072
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:20,046
supervised only, but there'll be


1073
00:31:20,046 --> 00:31:21,406
some grandfathering to make the


1074
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:22,776
transition a bit easier for


1075
00:31:22,776 --> 00:31:24,096
organizations relying on these


1076
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:24,816
restrictions.


1077
00:31:25,336 --> 00:31:27,486
For unsupervised devices with


1078
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:28,916
these restrictions enforced on


1079
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:31,016
iOS 12, when they're upgraded to


1080
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:32,756
iOS 13, they will remain in


1081
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:34,656
force, but they will not be


1082
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,236
honored on those unsupervised


1083
00:31:36,236 --> 00:31:37,926
devices if you backup and then


1084
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:39,366
restore to that device or


1085
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:40,816
another unsupervised device.


1086
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,746
This means that MDM servers need


1087
00:31:43,746 --> 00:31:44,616
to stop sending these


1088
00:31:44,616 --> 00:31:45,796
restrictions to unsupervised


1089
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:46,906
devices, because they will no


1090
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:47,716
longer be honored.


1091
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:52,146
Bob explained that user


1092
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:53,246
enrollment does not support the


1093
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:54,966
unlock token, and we're also


1094
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:56,276
making some changes device


1095
00:31:56,276 --> 00:31:57,796
enrollment related to it.


1096
00:31:58,236 --> 00:31:59,436
Specifically, though, this is


1097
00:31:59,436 --> 00:32:00,996
not new best practice.


1098
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:02,406
I always advise that you get the


1099
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:03,696
unlock token as soon as you need


1100
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:04,476
it and remember it.


1101
00:32:04,476 --> 00:32:06,756
It will now only be available in


1102
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:07,996
the first successful token


1103
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:09,106
update after enrollment.


1104
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,036
Similarly, devices which have


1105
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:13,476
been paired and supervised with


1106
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:15,506
Apple Configurator, you still


1107
00:32:15,506 --> 00:32:16,876
need to get the unlock token


1108
00:32:16,876 --> 00:32:18,436
before you set a passcode on


1109
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,136
that device.


1110
00:32:19,686 --> 00:32:21,866
So, that brings us to the end of


1111
00:32:21,866 --> 00:32:23,596
our second section of content,


1112
00:32:24,086 --> 00:32:26,146
and I'd like to now turn to some


1113
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:27,586
new device capabilities that


1114
00:32:27,586 --> 00:32:29,016
allow you to continue using


1115
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,276
services you're already using


1116
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:31,426
while adding some great new


1117
00:32:31,426 --> 00:32:33,226
Apple services to help Apple


1118
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:34,336
devices stand out in your


1119
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:34,966
organization.


1120
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:36,946
The first one is another really


1121
00:32:36,946 --> 00:32:38,296
big deal that Craig highlighted


1122
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:40,176
in Monday's keynote, and I'd


1123
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:41,376
like to ask Matt Chanda to come


1124
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,706
on stage and tell you all about


1125
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:43,526
Single Sign-On.


1126
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:43,896
Matt?


1127
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:50,216
[ Applause ]


1128
00:32:50,716 --> 00:32:51,346
>> Thanks, Todd.


1129
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:53,086
Good morning, my name's Matt


1130
00:32:53,086 --> 00:32:54,566
Chanda, and I am a consulting


1131
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:55,686
engineer and part of the team


1132
00:32:55,686 --> 00:32:57,036
that created Single Sign-On.


1133
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,426
As you know, almost all


1134
00:32:59,426 --> 00:33:00,896
enterprise apps and websites


1135
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,096
need to authenticate in order to


1136
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:02,486
function.


1137
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:04,806
These apps connect the systems


1138
00:33:04,806 --> 00:33:06,396
of record either in the cloud,


1139
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:09,066
on premise, and sometimes both.


1140
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,396
Recently though, authentication


1141
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:12,086
has been getting more


1142
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:12,796
complicated.


1143
00:33:13,406 --> 00:33:14,406
You have to handle multiple


1144
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:15,926
authentication protocols such as


1145
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:19,186
Kerberos, OpenID Connect, and


1146
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:20,726
SAML.


1147
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:21,726
You're now federated to the


1148
00:33:21,726 --> 00:33:23,476
cloud, and you need to trust


1149
00:33:23,476 --> 00:33:25,186
your devices and use more than


1150
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:26,026
just passwords for


1151
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:26,706
authentication.


1152
00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:29,426
So, how do organizations deal


1153
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:30,356
with these challenges?


1154
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,306
Well, they use Single Sign-On to


1155
00:33:32,306 --> 00:33:32,546
help.


1156
00:33:33,086 --> 00:33:36,366
When they use Single Sign-On,


1157
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:37,716
they have a suite of apps and


1158
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:40,086
websites that they log in once


1159
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:42,116
too, and is reused across all of


1160
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:42,206
them.


1161
00:33:43,176 --> 00:33:44,576
Organizations will also use this


1162
00:33:44,576 --> 00:33:46,096
to improve the user experience


1163
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:48,186
of authentication, avoid the


1164
00:33:48,186 --> 00:33:50,076
user friction of signing in over


1165
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:50,776
and over again.


1166
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,606
Some organizations just don't


1167
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:54,436
have passwords.


1168
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:55,966
So, they have to use Single


1169
00:33:55,966 --> 00:33:57,886
Sign-On to authenticate, and the


1170
00:33:57,886 --> 00:33:59,586
challenge is that not every


1171
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:01,646
application supports their


1172
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,446
authentication stack.


1173
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:08,226
And, with all the risks these


1174
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:10,126
days, you want to supplement


1175
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:11,436
your authentication processes


1176
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:12,746
with trust score data and other


1177
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:13,985
information about the device


1178
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,235
that you're running on.


1179
00:34:16,216 --> 00:34:17,536
So, today I'd like to tell you


1180
00:34:17,536 --> 00:34:18,716
about the powerful new Single


1181
00:34:18,716 --> 00:34:20,146
Sign-On capabilities we added to


1182
00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:22,676
both iOS 13 and macOS Catalina.


1183
00:34:23,755 --> 00:34:25,196
It's enabled by the extensible


1184
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,666
SSO MDM profile, as well as


1185
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,406
associated domains, and it works


1186
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:30,585
great with user enrollment, as


1187
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:30,815
well.


1188
00:34:32,065 --> 00:34:33,496
The extension has the option to


1189
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:37,255
show UI, load a webpage, or just


1190
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:38,516
handle the request silently.


1191
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:41,516
We think these changes will help


1192
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:44,735
you use and create SSO solutions


1193
00:34:45,156 --> 00:34:46,446
that are both secure and


1194
00:34:46,446 --> 00:34:47,076
user-friendly.


1195
00:34:47,676 --> 00:34:49,255
So, in our session today, I will


1196
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:50,255
provide a summary of Single


1197
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,536
Sign-On and how it works.


1198
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:53,376
For more detail, look for a


1199
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:54,565
recorded session after the


1200
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:55,985
conference with code samples and


1201
00:34:55,985 --> 00:34:56,616
more information.


1202
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:01,026
Earlier this week, you heard


1203
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:02,446
about an awesome new feature for


1204
00:35:02,696 --> 00:35:04,246
consumer apps called Sign in


1205
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:04,766
with Apple.


1206
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:06,226
This is going to be great for


1207
00:35:06,226 --> 00:35:07,306
consumer apps, but they don't


1208
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:08,336
support all the complex


1209
00:35:08,336 --> 00:35:09,926
scenarios that are needed for


1210
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:11,396
enterprise applications.


1211
00:35:12,606 --> 00:35:14,126
So, Single Sign-On is different,


1212
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:15,656
and it's intended for


1213
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,296
third-party identity providers,


1214
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:19,396
such as Microsoft, Okta, Ping,


1215
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:19,946
and others.


1216
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:22,696
In addition, you should know


1217
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:24,036
that managed Apple IDs will not


1218
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:28,276
work with Sign In with Apple.


1219
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:30,236
Okay, so, in order to make


1220
00:35:30,236 --> 00:35:31,896
Single Sign-On work, you need to


1221
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,546
have a set of apps and websites,


1222
00:35:34,136 --> 00:35:35,386
and you have to have an identity


1223
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:36,466
provider that they're set up to


1224
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:36,926
use.


1225
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:38,686
And then, what glues it together


1226
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:40,026
will be the new Single Sign-On


1227
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:40,606
extension.


1228
00:35:41,616 --> 00:35:42,626
So, we'll focus on the Single


1229
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:43,926
Sign-On extension today.


1230
00:35:43,926 --> 00:35:47,546
All right, so how does it work?


1231
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:49,406
There are two types of


1232
00:35:49,406 --> 00:35:50,926
extensions, redirect and


1233
00:35:50,926 --> 00:35:51,326
credential.


1234
00:35:52,336 --> 00:35:53,396
So, let's start with redirect


1235
00:35:53,396 --> 00:35:53,856
extensions.


1236
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:58,086
Redirect extensions are intended


1237
00:35:58,086 --> 00:35:59,486
for modern authentication


1238
00:35:59,486 --> 00:36:00,286
protocols, such as


1239
00:36:00,286 --> 00:36:02,356
OpenIDConnect, OAuth 2, or SAML.


1240
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,496
They will run on top of web


1241
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,886
technologies, and they


1242
00:36:05,886 --> 00:36:06,826
frequently are paired with


1243
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:08,346
Federation to on-premise or


1244
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:09,276
cloud systems for


1245
00:36:09,276 --> 00:36:10,016
authentication.


1246
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:14,546
Let's check out an example of


1247
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:15,606
the flow.


1248
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,816
With Safari, we will route a


1249
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:19,526
request to the Single Sign-On


1250
00:36:19,526 --> 00:36:20,976
extension instead of loading the


1251
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:21,676
webpage.


1252
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:25,066
The extension will receive the


1253
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:27,306
headers, the body, and the URL


1254
00:36:27,306 --> 00:36:27,996
of the request.


1255
00:36:29,196 --> 00:36:30,596
It's now up to the extension to


1256
00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:31,756
complete the authentication


1257
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:32,946
process with the identity


1258
00:36:32,946 --> 00:36:33,396
provider.


1259
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:37,236
And when ready, it will return a


1260
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,396
URL response back to Safari.


1261
00:36:40,846 --> 00:36:41,776
Please take note that this


1262
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:43,266
response should not be large.


1263
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:45,666
It's intended for a web form


1264
00:36:45,716 --> 00:36:48,146
post of SAML response or other


1265
00:36:48,146 --> 00:36:49,406
tokens back to the server.


1266
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:51,126
Don't try to load a giant, 1-meg


1267
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:51,856
webpage in it.


1268
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:57,556
So, what can these extensions


1269
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:57,956
do?


1270
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,566
They can do a lot of things.


1271
00:36:59,756 --> 00:37:01,616
I've listed a few of them here.


1272
00:37:01,906 --> 00:37:02,896
They can choose to present a


1273
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:04,576
native screen for authentication


1274
00:37:04,646 --> 00:37:06,106
instead of loading the webpage.


1275
00:37:06,906 --> 00:37:07,776
The native screen could ask for


1276
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:08,906
the username and password if


1277
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:10,576
that applies, or it can ask for


1278
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:12,166
additional multi-factors, as


1279
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,986
your requirements dictate.


1280
00:37:15,876 --> 00:37:17,426
If you've generated keys with


1281
00:37:17,426 --> 00:37:19,386
the secure enclave, perhaps they


1282
00:37:19,386 --> 00:37:20,796
can sign attributes and send it


1283
00:37:20,796 --> 00:37:21,886
along with the request to


1284
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:23,976
strongly pair the device with


1285
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:25,516
the user, so that you have that


1286
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:27,636
extra confidence in the request.


1287
00:37:28,856 --> 00:37:30,016
Other trust score values could


1288
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:31,326
be appended, such as the version


1289
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:32,386
of the operating system running


1290
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:33,706
on the device or whatever else


1291
00:37:33,706 --> 00:37:36,086
you need to feel good about it.


1292
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:39,826
It could simply load a webpage


1293
00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:40,996
and follow the redirects for


1294
00:37:40,996 --> 00:37:42,596
Federation, and that's going to


1295
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:44,546
be a very common scenario.


1296
00:37:45,756 --> 00:37:47,686
And with the new FIDO2


1297
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:49,826
capabilities in macOS this year,


1298
00:37:49,826 --> 00:37:51,656
it could use web authentication


1299
00:37:51,656 --> 00:37:52,886
to authenticate the device, as


1300
00:37:52,886 --> 00:37:54,276
well, if your identity provider


1301
00:37:54,276 --> 00:37:55,486
supports it.


1302
00:37:56,296 --> 00:37:57,636
For more information on web


1303
00:37:57,636 --> 00:37:59,286
authentication, see the What's


1304
00:37:59,286 --> 00:38:00,666
New in Authentication session in


1305
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:01,606
this year's conference.


1306
00:38:01,996 --> 00:38:05,336
Redirect extensions will also


1307
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:06,376
work for native apps.


1308
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:08,626
Native apps have an additional


1309
00:38:08,626 --> 00:38:09,466
capability though.


1310
00:38:09,596 --> 00:38:11,236
They can send operations to the


1311
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:11,766
extension.


1312
00:38:12,696 --> 00:38:14,656
These operations would be, or


1313
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,746
examples are login, refresh


1314
00:38:16,746 --> 00:38:18,006
tokens, or logout.


1315
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:20,716
This way, the app developers can


1316
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,486
decide when does authentication


1317
00:38:22,576 --> 00:38:23,736
fit within the flow of my


1318
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:24,426
application?


1319
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,576
And hopefully, the extension


1320
00:38:26,576 --> 00:38:27,756
will accommodate that.


1321
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:30,166
And for the enterprise


1322
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,896
developers in the audience, this


1323
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:33,086
means you can effectively use


1324
00:38:33,086 --> 00:38:34,886
the extension as your identity


1325
00:38:34,886 --> 00:38:36,316
library or authentication


1326
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:36,736
library.


1327
00:38:37,946 --> 00:38:39,376
It avoids the need to include a


1328
00:38:39,376 --> 00:38:40,886
copy of the library in every app


1329
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,036
that you have and then


1330
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:43,356
subsequently maintaining it over


1331
00:38:43,356 --> 00:38:43,716
time.


1332
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:48,031
[ Applause ]


1333
00:38:48,046 --> 00:38:48,526
It'll be great.


1334
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:52,696
So, let's check out the flow for


1335
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:53,706
native app.


1336
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,126
The native app will send the


1337
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,646
operation to the extension


1338
00:38:58,646 --> 00:39:00,246
instead of the URL request.


1339
00:39:00,246 --> 00:39:01,656
In this example, it's login.


1340
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:04,336
The extension is still


1341
00:39:04,336 --> 00:39:05,506
responsible for completing the


1342
00:39:05,506 --> 00:39:07,026
authentication process with the


1343
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:09,416
identity provider, and when


1344
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:10,656
ready, it will return the URL


1345
00:39:10,656 --> 00:39:11,986
response, but really, most


1346
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:13,246
importantly, the tokens that are


1347
00:39:13,246 --> 00:39:14,636
needed by that application that


1348
00:39:14,636 --> 00:39:16,136
they requested, in order to


1349
00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:17,676
process and work correctly,


1350
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:19,426
think ID tokens and access


1351
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:20,856
tokens for consuming other


1352
00:39:20,856 --> 00:39:21,326
services.


1353
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:24,906
Now that we know what it does,


1354
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:26,426
let's talk about what we need to


1355
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:27,236
do to make it work.


1356
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:31,706
It is enabled by the extensible


1357
00:39:31,706 --> 00:39:34,586
SSO profile in iOS 13 and macOS


1358
00:39:34,586 --> 00:39:35,106
Catalina.


1359
00:39:36,616 --> 00:39:37,606
Check out the example here.


1360
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:39,156
The identifier is


1361
00:39:39,156 --> 00:39:41,376
com.apple.extensiblesso.


1362
00:39:41,976 --> 00:39:45,456
It specifies the specific


1363
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:46,776
extension that you want to use


1364
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:48,046
in your environment, including


1365
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:48,996
the team identifier.


1366
00:39:50,456 --> 00:39:52,696
It lists the type, in this case,


1367
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:56,756
redirect, as well as the list of


1368
00:39:56,756 --> 00:39:59,136
URLs that will be redirected to


1369
00:39:59,136 --> 00:39:59,576
the extension.


1370
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:04,946
And finally, an optional


1371
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:07,216
dictionary of extension-specific


1372
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:08,156
values from the MDM.


1373
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,146
In this example, I'm sending a


1374
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:11,226
user name, but you can put


1375
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:12,186
whatever you need in there.


1376
00:40:15,876 --> 00:40:17,496
The second requirement is to use


1377
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:18,656
associated domains.


1378
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,856
You're required to use


1379
00:40:20,856 --> 00:40:22,086
associated domains because you


1380
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,406
can't just redirect any


1381
00:40:23,406 --> 00:40:24,726
authentication traffic on the


1382
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:25,836
device to your extension.


1383
00:40:26,756 --> 00:40:29,266
You can only redirect traffic


1384
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:30,936
that is owned by you or your


1385
00:40:30,936 --> 00:40:31,786
identity provider.


1386
00:40:33,796 --> 00:40:34,846
So, in order to set up


1387
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:36,806
associated domains, you need to


1388
00:40:36,806 --> 00:40:38,866
use the offserve service type,


1389
00:40:39,176 --> 00:40:40,526
followed by a colon, and then,


1390
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:41,996
each of the host names in the


1391
00:40:41,996 --> 00:40:42,936
URL list that we saw in the


1392
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:43,646
previous slides.


1393
00:40:43,646 --> 00:40:47,626
If your app has multiple hosts,


1394
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:49,096
then you need to list each one


1395
00:40:49,096 --> 00:40:50,446
separately in the file.


1396
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:54,976
Associated Domains also requires


1397
00:40:54,976 --> 00:40:57,476
that the host app ID is in the


1398
00:40:57,476 --> 00:40:59,356
Apple app site association file


1399
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,786
that on the destination server.


1400
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,676
The server must be accessible by


1401
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:05,596
the device and have a valid SSL


1402
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:05,966
cert.


1403
00:41:07,046 --> 00:41:08,396
User-approved or custom root


1404
00:41:08,396 --> 00:41:09,796
certificates are not supported.


1405
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:14,096
However, in some cases, the


1406
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,886
associated domains are not known


1407
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:16,816
at the time the app is


1408
00:41:16,816 --> 00:41:17,306
developed.


1409
00:41:18,146 --> 00:41:20,076
A great example of this is when


1410
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:21,706
an identity provider develops an


1411
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:25,626
extension, but each customer's


1412
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:26,666
hostname is different.


1413
00:41:26,996 --> 00:41:28,046
They can't list thousands of


1414
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:29,256
them in an entitlement file.


1415
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:30,176
It just won't happen.


1416
00:41:30,806 --> 00:41:32,166
When this occurs, we can use the


1417
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,786
new Manage Associated Domains


1418
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:35,376
profile on macOS.


1419
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:39,396
In the example here, note that


1420
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,956
the payload value is the same as


1421
00:41:41,956 --> 00:41:42,756
what would've been in the


1422
00:41:42,756 --> 00:41:45,216
entitlement file that was on the


1423
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:48,156
app that was developed.


1424
00:41:48,156 --> 00:41:49,546
On iOS, you can use a new


1425
00:41:49,546 --> 00:41:51,276
associated domains application


1426
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:53,906
attribute, and again, note that


1427
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:56,696
the value of the attribute is


1428
00:41:56,696 --> 00:41:57,596
the same as what would've been


1429
00:41:57,596 --> 00:41:58,836
in the entitlements file in the


1430
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:00,616
host app that would happen.


1431
00:42:01,206 --> 00:42:03,896
The last step for using managed


1432
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,176
associated domains is to include


1433
00:42:06,176 --> 00:42:07,946
the managed associated domain's


1434
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:10,556
entitlement in the host apps


1435
00:42:10,556 --> 00:42:10,946
file.


1436
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:12,256
This lets us know that you want


1437
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:13,566
to use the managed values, in


1438
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:14,566
addition to what you already


1439
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:15,966
have inside the entitlement


1440
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:16,306
file.


1441
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:18,936
The associated domain's array


1442
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,466
has to be present and not empty,


1443
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:23,546
and you can even have other


1444
00:42:23,546 --> 00:42:24,866
values in there already, and we


1445
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:26,936
will pin the ones from the MDM


1446
00:42:26,936 --> 00:42:28,426
into the list there for you to


1447
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:29,506
use.


1448
00:42:30,276 --> 00:42:31,866
For more details on associated


1449
00:42:31,866 --> 00:42:33,996
domains, how to use them, check


1450
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:35,306
out the What's New in Universal


1451
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:36,406
Links session in this year's


1452
00:42:36,406 --> 00:42:36,956
conference.


1453
00:42:41,216 --> 00:42:42,146
All right, and that completes


1454
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:43,246
redirect extensions.


1455
00:42:44,366 --> 00:42:45,096
So, now let's shift to


1456
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:46,276
credential extensions.


1457
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:50,346
Credential extensions are


1458
00:42:50,346 --> 00:42:50,876
intended for


1459
00:42:50,876 --> 00:42:52,486
challenge-response-type


1460
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,896
authentication flows, and a


1461
00:42:53,896 --> 00:42:54,926
great example of this is


1462
00:42:54,926 --> 00:42:55,566
Kerberos.


1463
00:42:56,876 --> 00:42:58,296
These flows are different than


1464
00:42:58,296 --> 00:43:00,176
redirects, because the client


1465
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:01,606
will request the data and then


1466
00:43:01,606 --> 00:43:02,566
they are challenged for


1467
00:43:02,566 --> 00:43:03,326
authentication.


1468
00:43:04,446 --> 00:43:07,286
Whereas redirect extensions, the


1469
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:08,906
client will proactively go out


1470
00:43:08,906 --> 00:43:10,496
and retrieve tokens before


1471
00:43:10,496 --> 00:43:12,296
they're needed and then use


1472
00:43:12,296 --> 00:43:12,466
them.


1473
00:43:14,056 --> 00:43:15,136
We also support custom


1474
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:16,626
authentication challenges for


1475
00:43:17,366 --> 00:43:17,486
this.


1476
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,836
Credential extensions are


1477
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:21,696
different in redirect


1478
00:43:21,696 --> 00:43:23,446
extensions, in that they receive


1479
00:43:23,446 --> 00:43:24,756
HTTP challenge from the


1480
00:43:24,756 --> 00:43:25,936
operating system and not the


1481
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,506
request.


1482
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:29,156
The challenge will include the


1483
00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:30,586
URL and the headers that were


1484
00:43:30,586 --> 00:43:31,116
returned.


1485
00:43:31,616 --> 00:43:34,136
The MDM profile will contain a


1486
00:43:34,136 --> 00:43:36,896
list of hosts or host suffixes


1487
00:43:37,476 --> 00:43:38,936
that applies to that extension.


1488
00:43:40,136 --> 00:43:41,176
So, for example, if you have


1489
00:43:41,266 --> 00:43:43,246
.example.com, it'll be treated


1490
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,736
as a suffix.


1491
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:47,606
Operations are also supported


1492
00:43:47,606 --> 00:43:49,286
for credential-mode extensions,


1493
00:43:50,356 --> 00:43:51,756
and there's not an associated


1494
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:55,576
domain requirement for them.


1495
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,696
Okay, so let's check out the


1496
00:43:56,696 --> 00:43:57,036
flow.


1497
00:43:58,436 --> 00:43:59,986
In Safari, or your native app,


1498
00:43:59,986 --> 00:44:01,116
it'll make a request to a


1499
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:01,586
server.


1500
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:04,216
The server will return an


1501
00:44:04,216 --> 00:44:06,676
authentication challenge back to


1502
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:07,796
the operating system, which we


1503
00:44:07,796 --> 00:44:08,946
will route to the extension.


1504
00:44:10,006 --> 00:44:11,346
Just like the other extensions,


1505
00:44:11,346 --> 00:44:14,126
it is required that it completes


1506
00:44:14,126 --> 00:44:15,516
the authentication process with


1507
00:44:15,516 --> 00:44:17,166
the identity provider or the


1508
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:18,726
authentication servers, whatever


1509
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:20,726
it may be.


1510
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:22,546
And when ready, the extension


1511
00:44:22,546 --> 00:44:25,416
will return the headers back to


1512
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:26,496
the operating system, which will


1513
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:27,936
get sent back to the server, and


1514
00:44:28,436 --> 00:44:29,916
assuming the server accepts it,


1515
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:31,236
the data will be returned back


1516
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:33,026
to the calling app that's


1517
00:44:33,026 --> 00:44:33,336
needed.


1518
00:44:33,606 --> 00:44:36,356
And that's the flow for


1519
00:44:36,356 --> 00:44:37,466
credential extensions.


1520
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:39,516
And now for a demo of credential


1521
00:44:39,516 --> 00:44:40,556
mode extensions, I'd like to


1522
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:42,016
call my colleague, Rick Lemmon.


1523
00:44:42,256 --> 00:44:42,486
Rick?


1524
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:47,766
[ Applause ]


1525
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:49,406
>> Hey, thanks a lot, Matt.


1526
00:44:49,906 --> 00:44:51,306
Hi everybody, my name's Rick


1527
00:44:51,306 --> 00:44:52,616
Lemmon, and I'm an engineer on


1528
00:44:52,616 --> 00:44:53,866
the Apple Professional Services


1529
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:54,026
Team.


1530
00:44:55,076 --> 00:44:56,386
Today, I'd like to demonstrate a


1531
00:44:56,386 --> 00:44:57,726
credential mode extension to you


1532
00:44:58,536 --> 00:44:59,136
that we've built.


1533
00:44:59,776 --> 00:45:01,246
This extension makes it easy for


1534
00:45:01,246 --> 00:45:02,886
users to use Single Sign-On with


1535
00:45:02,886 --> 00:45:04,086
your apps and websites.


1536
00:45:04,896 --> 00:45:06,046
If you develop a Single Sign-On


1537
00:45:06,046 --> 00:45:08,056
extension, you'll probably


1538
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:09,436
deliver it to your users as part


1539
00:45:09,436 --> 00:45:10,506
of an app.


1540
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:12,256
So, this app can be used to


1541
00:45:12,256 --> 00:45:13,836
deliver functionality that might


1542
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:14,936
not make sense to deliver in


1543
00:45:14,936 --> 00:45:17,456
your extension, such as


1544
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:18,986
displaying status information to


1545
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:20,486
the user or allowing them to


1546
00:45:20,486 --> 00:45:21,656
change their password.


1547
00:45:22,276 --> 00:45:24,036
In our extension, what we've


1548
00:45:24,036 --> 00:45:25,676
done is use a menu extra to do


1549
00:45:25,676 --> 00:45:25,846
this.


1550
00:45:25,846 --> 00:45:26,876
So, that's a little great key


1551
00:45:26,876 --> 00:45:27,676
that we see up here.


1552
00:45:28,536 --> 00:45:30,136
So, what I'd like to do now is


1553
00:45:30,136 --> 00:45:31,286
go ahead and sign into the


1554
00:45:31,286 --> 00:45:31,686
extension.


1555
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:33,966
Let's go ahead and sign in.


1556
00:45:34,556 --> 00:45:36,186
I'm going to go ahead and enter


1557
00:45:36,186 --> 00:45:37,216
my username and password.


1558
00:45:43,056 --> 00:45:45,206
And click sign in.


1559
00:45:45,586 --> 00:45:47,276
Great. Now we're signed in.


1560
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:48,926
So, let's go back and look at


1561
00:45:48,926 --> 00:45:49,576
the menu extra.


1562
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,516
You'll notice in the menu extra,


1563
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:53,786
we're now displaying some useful


1564
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:55,156
status information to the user,


1565
00:45:55,906 --> 00:45:57,056
like the user that we're signed


1566
00:45:57,056 --> 00:45:58,396
in as and when our password


1567
00:45:58,396 --> 00:45:58,956
expires.


1568
00:45:59,396 --> 00:46:00,706
We also exposed some useful


1569
00:46:00,706 --> 00:46:01,996
functionality, like the ability


1570
00:46:01,996 --> 00:46:03,336
to change your password and sign


1571
00:46:03,336 --> 00:46:03,526
out.


1572
00:46:04,946 --> 00:46:06,466
But now that we're signed into


1573
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:08,136
the Single Sign-On extension, we


1574
00:46:08,136 --> 00:46:09,746
can use Single Sign-On to access


1575
00:46:09,746 --> 00:46:10,786
websites and apps.


1576
00:46:10,966 --> 00:46:12,176
So, let's go ahead and try a


1577
00:46:12,176 --> 00:46:13,516
sample website that we've built.


1578
00:46:14,456 --> 00:46:16,616
Let's go ahead and, well, load


1579
00:46:16,616 --> 00:46:17,416
the sample website.


1580
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:20,246
And, excellent.


1581
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,766
You've seen that we've just used


1582
00:46:21,766 --> 00:46:23,046
Single Sign-On to access this


1583
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,116
website, and you'll notice, I


1584
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:25,506
wasn't prompted to authenticate.


1585
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:26,936
We can see that I'm


1586
00:46:26,936 --> 00:46:28,456
authenticated as the same user


1587
00:46:28,456 --> 00:46:30,896
that I used to sign into the


1588
00:46:30,896 --> 00:46:31,656
extension earlier.


1589
00:46:32,766 --> 00:46:35,136
Let's go ahead and quit Safari,


1590
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,626
and let's show you how this


1591
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:37,936
works from an app.


1592
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:39,626
I'm going to go ahead and launch


1593
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:40,956
an app called Image Retriever


1594
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:41,986
that we wrote for this demo.


1595
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:43,756
This app is really simple.


1596
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:46,036
All that it does is connect to a


1597
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,376
web server that typically


1598
00:46:47,376 --> 00:46:48,566
requires authentication,


1599
00:46:48,846 --> 00:46:50,696
download an image, and displays


1600
00:46:50,696 --> 00:46:51,096
it.


1601
00:46:52,236 --> 00:46:54,466
Now normally, you'd have to


1602
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:55,366
implement some sort of


1603
00:46:55,366 --> 00:46:56,656
authentication for this app to


1604
00:46:56,656 --> 00:46:57,986
work, but since we have Single


1605
00:46:57,986 --> 00:46:59,086
Sign-On and in place, we don't


1606
00:46:59,086 --> 00:46:59,236
need to.


1607
00:46:59,236 --> 00:46:59,776
Let me go ahead and click


1608
00:46:59,776 --> 00:46:59,976
display.


1609
00:47:03,326 --> 00:47:03,756
Excellent.


1610
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,556
As you might guess, based on my


1611
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:06,876
last name, I have something of a


1612
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:07,846
soft spot for lemons.


1613
00:47:07,846 --> 00:47:09,316
So, our app has gone out,


1614
00:47:09,386 --> 00:47:10,656
connected to a web server,


1615
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,256
authenticated using our Single


1616
00:47:12,256 --> 00:47:13,586
Sign-On extension, and


1617
00:47:13,586 --> 00:47:14,706
downloaded this super-sweet


1618
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,866
image of lemons.


1619
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:19,031
[ Applause ]


1620
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:19,246
Thank you.


1621
00:47:20,121 --> 00:47:22,121
[ Applause ]


1622
00:47:22,226 --> 00:47:24,366
So, let me quit Image Retriever


1623
00:47:24,366 --> 00:47:25,516
now, and I'm going to show you


1624
00:47:25,516 --> 00:47:26,826
guys some ways that


1625
00:47:26,826 --> 00:47:28,306
authentication to the extension


1626
00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:28,966
can be triggered.


1627
00:47:30,026 --> 00:47:31,456
To do that, I'll need to sign


1628
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:32,616
out of the extension, which I'll


1629
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:33,866
do here in the menu extra.


1630
00:47:33,866 --> 00:47:36,506
Now just a note, your users, if


1631
00:47:36,506 --> 00:47:38,366
you make an extension, will need


1632
00:47:38,366 --> 00:47:40,316
to sign out of the extension.


1633
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,676
We're just doing this purely for


1634
00:47:41,676 --> 00:47:42,776
demonstration purposes.


1635
00:47:43,586 --> 00:47:45,836
So, now that I signed out, let's


1636
00:47:45,836 --> 00:47:47,136
go ahead and launch Safari.


1637
00:47:48,716 --> 00:47:49,826
I'll go ahead and click on our


1638
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:50,336
website.


1639
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:52,626
You'll notice I was immediately


1640
00:47:52,626 --> 00:47:54,006
prompted to authenticate, which


1641
00:47:54,006 --> 00:47:54,766
I'll go ahead and do.


1642
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:00,746
And we'll click sign in.


1643
00:48:02,126 --> 00:48:02,526
Excellent.


1644
00:48:02,926 --> 00:48:03,996
You'll notice that as soon as I


1645
00:48:03,996 --> 00:48:05,486
signed in, Safari was able to


1646
00:48:05,486 --> 00:48:06,916
seamlessly authenticate and load


1647
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:07,496
my website.


1648
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,186
So, I'll go ahead and quit


1649
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:09,636
Safari.


1650
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:12,186
I will sign out of the


1651
00:48:12,186 --> 00:48:13,706
extension, and we'll try the


1652
00:48:13,706 --> 00:48:14,766
image retriever app again.


1653
00:48:16,106 --> 00:48:17,516
Let's go ahead and click display


1654
00:48:17,636 --> 00:48:18,526
to make the image load.


1655
00:48:19,536 --> 00:48:20,486
You'll notice I'm prompted


1656
00:48:20,486 --> 00:48:20,766
again.


1657
00:48:26,396 --> 00:48:27,026
We'll sign in.


1658
00:48:28,816 --> 00:48:29,746
Excellent.


1659
00:48:29,746 --> 00:48:30,926
Our image of lemons downloaded


1660
00:48:30,926 --> 00:48:31,166
again.


1661
00:48:31,236 --> 00:48:31,976
Thank you.


1662
00:48:32,508 --> 00:48:34,508
[ Applause ]


1663
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:40,016
Great. So, let's talk a little


1664
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:41,386
bit more about this particular


1665
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:41,836
extension.


1666
00:48:42,346 --> 00:48:44,156
So, some of you might see this


1667
00:48:44,156 --> 00:48:45,636
extension and say, you know


1668
00:48:45,636 --> 00:48:46,116
what?


1669
00:48:46,116 --> 00:48:47,426
This could be useful in my own


1670
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:48,116
organization.


1671
00:48:48,616 --> 00:48:50,216
Well, we agree with you.


1672
00:48:50,706 --> 00:48:51,966
One thing that we haven't told


1673
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:53,436
you yet is that this extension,


1674
00:48:53,436 --> 00:48:54,706
behind the scenes, is using


1675
00:48:54,706 --> 00:48:56,246
Kerberos and Active Directory.


1676
00:48:57,386 --> 00:48:58,956
And so, we're thrilled to


1677
00:48:58,956 --> 00:49:02,046
announce that this extension


1678
00:49:02,046 --> 00:49:03,506
will be included with macOS


1679
00:49:03,506 --> 00:49:05,866
Catalina, iOS13, and iPadOS.


1680
00:49:06,516 --> 00:49:12,866
[ Applause ]


1681
00:49:13,366 --> 00:49:13,986
Thank you.


1682
00:49:14,156 --> 00:49:15,776
This extension is based on


1683
00:49:15,776 --> 00:49:17,376
Enterprise Connect, an Active


1684
00:49:17,376 --> 00:49:18,846
Directory integration solution


1685
00:49:18,846 --> 00:49:20,066
that some of you may already be


1686
00:49:20,176 --> 00:49:20,466
using.


1687
00:49:20,766 --> 00:49:22,496
It provides an easy way to


1688
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:23,576
integrate your devices with


1689
00:49:23,576 --> 00:49:24,366
Active Directory.


1690
00:49:25,336 --> 00:49:26,716
On top of providing Kerberos


1691
00:49:26,716 --> 00:49:28,316
support, it helps you manage


1692
00:49:28,316 --> 00:49:30,046
your Active Directory password,


1693
00:49:30,276 --> 00:49:32,076
and on macOS, helps you keep


1694
00:49:32,076 --> 00:49:33,356
your local and active directory


1695
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:34,326
passwords in sync.


1696
00:49:35,086 --> 00:49:37,036
Also, on top of authenticating


1697
00:49:37,036 --> 00:49:37,946
through the extension with the


1698
00:49:37,946 --> 00:49:39,726
username and password, you can


1699
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,836
use the certificate-based


1700
00:49:40,836 --> 00:49:42,756
identity, or on macOS, you can


1701
00:49:42,756 --> 00:49:43,496
use a smart card.


1702
00:49:44,286 --> 00:49:45,356
We think this extension will


1703
00:49:45,356 --> 00:49:47,026
help many of you more easily use


1704
00:49:47,056 --> 00:49:48,476
Kerberos and Active Directory in


1705
00:49:48,476 --> 00:49:49,486
your organizations.


1706
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,636
And that concludes


1707
00:49:52,636 --> 00:49:53,766
credential-based Single Sign-On


1708
00:49:53,766 --> 00:49:54,386
extensions.


1709
00:49:55,866 --> 00:49:57,376
So, let's summarize.


1710
00:49:57,946 --> 00:49:59,196
We're really looking forward to


1711
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:00,446
seeing what kind of extensions


1712
00:50:00,446 --> 00:50:02,236
you built, out the Single


1713
00:50:02,236 --> 00:50:03,996
Sign-On session for additional


1714
00:50:03,996 --> 00:50:05,206
detail on making your own


1715
00:50:05,206 --> 00:50:05,786
extensions.


1716
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:07,926
It will be posted to the WWDC


1717
00:50:07,926 --> 00:50:09,396
site after the conference, and


1718
00:50:09,396 --> 00:50:10,436
now I'll hand it back to Todd.


1719
00:50:11,516 --> 00:50:17,566
[ Applause ]


1720
00:50:18,066 --> 00:50:19,626
Thank you very much, Matt and


1721
00:50:19,656 --> 00:50:19,766
Rick.


1722
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,836
Just have a few more words about


1723
00:50:20,836 --> 00:50:22,696
associated domains, which, as


1724
00:50:22,696 --> 00:50:24,426
Matt explained, can be managed


1725
00:50:24,426 --> 00:50:25,986
via MDM, but they're not just


1726
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:26,956
for Single Sign On.


1727
00:50:27,726 --> 00:50:30,006
Other service types, such as


1728
00:50:30,246 --> 00:50:31,906
universal links and password


1729
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:33,556
autofill, are also supported by


1730
00:50:33,556 --> 00:50:35,796
associated domains, and they're


1731
00:50:35,796 --> 00:50:37,436
now also supported by custom


1732
00:50:37,566 --> 00:50:39,246
apps, not just App Store apps.


1733
00:50:39,976 --> 00:50:41,196
So again, if you'd like to learn


1734
00:50:41,196 --> 00:50:42,626
more about them, check out the


1735
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:43,866
Universal Links session from


1736
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:44,656
earlier this week.


1737
00:50:45,266 --> 00:50:47,836
Now I mentioned federated


1738
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,086
authentication earlier in the


1739
00:50:49,086 --> 00:50:50,246
session, but I wanted to


1740
00:50:50,246 --> 00:50:51,636
highlight it here again, because


1741
00:50:51,836 --> 00:50:53,156
it, along with a number of the


1742
00:50:53,156 --> 00:50:54,296
other things we've announced


1743
00:50:54,376 --> 00:50:56,516
here this morning, come together


1744
00:50:56,516 --> 00:50:57,946
is a great example of how we


1745
00:50:57,946 --> 00:50:59,776
enable Apple devices to fit in


1746
00:50:59,776 --> 00:51:00,826
while standing out in your


1747
00:51:00,826 --> 00:51:01,536
organization.


1748
00:51:03,676 --> 00:51:05,906
Managed Apple IDs coming to ABM


1749
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:07,726
and User Enrollment requiring


1750
00:51:07,726 --> 00:51:10,506
Managed Apple ID means that


1751
00:51:10,506 --> 00:51:11,736
we've made it really easy for


1752
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,016
you to take advantage of user


1753
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:14,306
enrollment with the identities


1754
00:51:14,306 --> 00:51:15,486
that you're already using.


1755
00:51:17,456 --> 00:51:19,136
Now we've spent a lot of time


1756
00:51:19,136 --> 00:51:20,476
today talking about the new, hot


1757
00:51:20,656 --> 00:51:21,696
user enrollment, and that's


1758
00:51:21,696 --> 00:51:22,986
great, but of course, we haven't


1759
00:51:22,986 --> 00:51:24,306
stopped improving device


1760
00:51:24,306 --> 00:51:25,156
enrollment either.


1761
00:51:26,106 --> 00:51:27,376
So, I want to talk about a great


1762
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,406
new feature that allows


1763
00:51:28,406 --> 00:51:30,066
organizations to customize the


1764
00:51:30,066 --> 00:51:31,656
experience their users have


1765
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:33,096
right inside of Setup Assistant


1766
00:51:33,096 --> 00:51:33,886
as they're enrolling their


1767
00:51:33,886 --> 00:51:34,276
devices.


1768
00:51:34,276 --> 00:51:35,976
This is great.


1769
00:51:36,516 --> 00:51:38,676
[ Applause ]


1770
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:40,726
You can now provide your own


1771
00:51:40,726 --> 00:51:42,596
custom web UI that you can use


1772
00:51:42,596 --> 00:51:43,806
for a number of important


1773
00:51:43,806 --> 00:51:45,996
purposes from choosing the


1774
00:51:45,996 --> 00:51:47,206
authentication type you want to


1775
00:51:47,206 --> 00:51:48,216
use, something modern,


1776
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:49,726
multifactor, whatever works for


1777
00:51:49,726 --> 00:51:51,576
your organization, custom


1778
00:51:51,576 --> 00:51:53,686
organization branding, and


1779
00:51:53,686 --> 00:51:55,066
whatever additional information


1780
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:57,246
you want users to have access to


1781
00:51:57,476 --> 00:51:58,846
while they're enrolling, again,


1782
00:51:58,846 --> 00:52:00,166
right in Setup Assistant,


1783
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:01,266
whether it's your privacy


1784
00:52:01,266 --> 00:52:03,846
policy, additional consent text,


1785
00:52:03,846 --> 00:52:05,476
or your acceptable use policy.


1786
00:52:06,046 --> 00:52:07,196
And just to give you an idea,


1787
00:52:07,196 --> 00:52:08,186
again, this should look very


1788
00:52:08,186 --> 00:52:10,736
familiar, but instead of seeing


1789
00:52:10,736 --> 00:52:13,016
our off UI on the next pane in


1790
00:52:13,016 --> 00:52:14,706
Setup Assistant, you can see


1791
00:52:14,706 --> 00:52:15,496
your UI.


1792
00:52:16,556 --> 00:52:18,146
Here's an example on the Mac of


1793
00:52:18,146 --> 00:52:19,056
authentication.


1794
00:52:20,116 --> 00:52:21,116
This is really exciting.


1795
00:52:23,726 --> 00:52:25,676
And in the iPhone, an example,


1796
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:26,876
Acceptable Use Policy.


1797
00:52:26,946 --> 00:52:28,496
Basically, this just gives you a


1798
00:52:28,496 --> 00:52:30,806
way to give your users the exact


1799
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:32,346
right experience for them in


1800
00:52:32,346 --> 00:52:33,476
your organization.


1801
00:52:35,836 --> 00:52:37,296
I mentioned content caching


1802
00:52:37,296 --> 00:52:37,856
earlier.


1803
00:52:37,856 --> 00:52:39,356
This is a great way to optimize


1804
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:40,746
how your organization uses its


1805
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:43,766
bandwidth, and to date, it's


1806
00:52:43,856 --> 00:52:45,856
been a best-effort optimization.


1807
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:47,446
But now it's possible to


1808
00:52:47,446 --> 00:52:48,716
configure it, as required


1809
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:50,256
infrastructure for all devices


1810
00:52:50,256 --> 00:52:51,616
on your network, if that's what


1811
00:52:51,616 --> 00:52:52,906
works for your organization.


1812
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:54,806
And you can also configure


1813
00:52:54,806 --> 00:52:56,846
devices to prefer specific


1814
00:52:56,846 --> 00:52:57,986
client caches.


1815
00:52:59,496 --> 00:53:01,626
Now, of course, there's lots of


1816
00:53:01,626 --> 00:53:02,546
other things we've added this


1817
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:03,966
year, just like always, enabling


1818
00:53:03,966 --> 00:53:04,886
you to configure the Setup


1819
00:53:04,886 --> 00:53:06,206
Assistant and lots of other


1820
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:08,046
settings and restrictions, and


1821
00:53:08,396 --> 00:53:09,716
that's really great, but I think


1822
00:53:09,716 --> 00:53:10,656
we should really read the


1823
00:53:10,656 --> 00:53:12,176
documentation together instead


1824
00:53:12,176 --> 00:53:15,136
of hearing me talk about it.


1825
00:53:15,136 --> 00:53:17,096
Because we are so excited about


1826
00:53:17,186 --> 00:53:18,716
the giant leap forward we made


1827
00:53:18,716 --> 00:53:20,186
in giving you what you deserve,


1828
00:53:20,186 --> 00:53:21,776
comprehensive, up-to-date


1829
00:53:21,776 --> 00:53:24,256
documentation, both because


1830
00:53:24,256 --> 00:53:25,276
we've improved our internal


1831
00:53:25,276 --> 00:53:27,756
processes, allowing us to import


1832
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:29,566
our new keys and values that we


1833
00:53:29,566 --> 00:53:31,506
add to the profile payloads and


1834
00:53:31,506 --> 00:53:33,196
MDM commands directly from our


1835
00:53:33,196 --> 00:53:35,526
code into the documentation, and


1836
00:53:35,526 --> 00:53:36,796
then showing that documentation


1837
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,476
to you just like all other Apple


1838
00:53:38,476 --> 00:53:40,666
documentation, including a great


1839
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,246
way to highlight the changes


1840
00:53:42,246 --> 00:53:43,726
introduced in a particular OS


1841
00:53:43,726 --> 00:53:44,736
release.


1842
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:45,856
We think this will make it much


1843
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,046
easier for you to adopt


1844
00:53:47,046 --> 00:53:48,066
everything we've talked about


1845
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:49,686
today and in the future more


1846
00:53:49,686 --> 00:53:51,326
quickly for all of our joint


1847
00:53:51,326 --> 00:53:52,626
customers to take advantage of.


1848
00:53:53,436 --> 00:53:54,396
But instead of me talking about


1849
00:53:54,396 --> 00:53:55,756
it anymore, I'd like to ask


1850
00:53:55,756 --> 00:53:57,286
Graham McLuhan to come on stage


1851
00:53:57,366 --> 00:53:58,156
and show it to you.


1852
00:53:58,386 --> 00:53:58,726
Graham?

00:54:07,056 --> 00:54:07,746
>> Thank you, Todd.


1855
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:08,966
I'm really excited to be here


1856
00:54:08,966 --> 00:54:10,076
today to show you the latest


1857
00:54:10,076 --> 00:54:11,646
device management documentation.


1858
00:54:12,776 --> 00:54:13,696
Who's had a chance to check out


1859
00:54:13,696 --> 00:54:14,696
the new documentation?


1860
00:54:15,946 --> 00:54:17,116
Yeah, all right, it's really


1861
00:54:17,116 --> 00:54:17,386
great.


1862
00:54:17,906 --> 00:54:19,036
So, for those of you who haven't


1863
00:54:19,036 --> 00:54:20,016
had a chance to check it out,


1864
00:54:20,016 --> 00:54:21,086
let's take a look.


1865
00:54:22,086 --> 00:54:22,896
So, the first thing that you'll


1866
00:54:22,896 --> 00:54:23,946
notice is that the device


1867
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:25,586
management documentation has a


1868
00:54:25,586 --> 00:54:27,316
new home alongside the rest of


1869
00:54:27,316 --> 00:54:28,116
the Apple developer


1870
00:54:28,116 --> 00:54:28,936
documentation.


1871
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:31,266
Clicking in, you'll see all of


1872
00:54:31,266 --> 00:54:32,076
the things that you're used to


1873
00:54:32,076 --> 00:54:33,776
seeing, configuration profiles,


1874
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,106
MDM protocol, and deployment


1875
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:36,646
services.


1876
00:54:37,286 --> 00:54:38,096
So, let's take a look at the


1877
00:54:38,096 --> 00:54:39,356
configuration profiles.


1878
00:54:41,246 --> 00:54:42,146
Here you'll see an


1879

easy-to-search list of all of


1880
00:54:43,896 --> 00:54:45,056
the different profiles that are


1881
00:54:45,056 --> 00:54:46,026
available on all of our


1882
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:46,646
platforms.


1883
00:54:47,376 --> 00:54:48,306
Let's take a look at the


1884
00:54:48,306 --> 00:54:50,036
ExchangeActiveSync payload.


1885
00:54:52,016 --> 00:54:52,816
The first thing I'd like to


1886
00:54:52,816 --> 00:54:54,666
point out here is the Show API


1887
00:54:54,836 --> 00:54:56,936
Changes option, where you'll be


1888
00:54:56,936 --> 00:54:58,296
able to see the differences


1889
00:54:58,296 --> 00:54:59,806
between the current OS release


1890
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:01,356
and the upcoming beta.


1891
00:55:03,206 --> 00:55:03,906
Yes, great.

[ Applause ]


1893
00:55:07,046 --> 00:55:08,316
On the left-hand side, you can


1894
00:55:08,356 --> 00:55:09,236
see there's been one


1895
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:10,916
modification to an existing key


1896
00:55:11,286 --> 00:55:12,796
and 12 new keys added.


1897
00:55:13,046 --> 00:55:14,976
As a note, to find out which


1898
00:55:14,976 --> 00:55:16,606
Xcode versions relate to which


1899
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:18,136
OS releases, you can check the


1900
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:19,136
Xcode release notes.


1901
00:55:20,446 --> 00:55:21,746
Below that, in the property


1902
00:55:21,746 --> 00:55:23,466
section, you can see all the


1903
00:55:23,466 --> 00:55:25,616
keys, their types, and their


1904
00:55:25,616 --> 00:55:26,946
default values that make up the


1905
00:55:26,946 --> 00:55:27,506
payload.


1906
00:55:28,606 --> 00:55:30,606
As we scroll down, you can see


1907
00:55:30,606 --> 00:55:32,416
that the keys are highlighted


1908
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,576
with purple tildes are modified


1909
00:55:34,576 --> 00:55:36,976
keys, and the new keys that


1910
00:55:36,976 --> 00:55:38,316
we've added are highlighted with


1911
00:55:38,316 --> 00:55:39,386
the green plus sign.


1912
00:55:41,156 --> 00:55:42,876
Below that, we have a profile


1913
00:55:42,876 --> 00:55:44,456
availability table that shows


1914
00:55:44,456 --> 00:55:45,326
you all of the different


1915
00:55:45,326 --> 00:55:46,446
platforms the payload is


1916
00:55:46,446 --> 00:55:48,286
supported on, and below that, we


1917
00:55:48,286 --> 00:55:49,756
have related objects, such as


1918
00:55:49,756 --> 00:55:50,886
dictionaries, that make up the


1919
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:52,976
payload, as well as other


1920
00:55:52,976 --> 00:55:54,076
related payloads you may be


1921
00:55:54,076 --> 00:55:56,286
interested in.


1922
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:59,736
So, let's jump back to the


1923
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:01,226
top-level device management page


1924
00:56:01,226 --> 00:56:02,716
using the breadcrumbs at the top


1925
00:56:02,716 --> 00:56:03,176
of the page.


1926
00:56:04,016 --> 00:56:05,476
Now, with the Show API Changes


1927
00:56:05,476 --> 00:56:07,046
enabled, we can also see that


1928
00:56:07,046 --> 00:56:07,996
there have been some changes to


1929
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:08,956
the MDM protocol.


1930
00:56:09,196 --> 00:56:09,986
So, let's take a look.


1931
00:56:11,856 --> 00:56:12,816
Here you'll find it


1932
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:14,296
easy-to-search list of all of


1933
00:56:14,296 --> 00:56:16,026
the different commands and


1934
00:56:16,026 --> 00:56:17,186
queries that are available.


1935
00:56:17,756 --> 00:56:19,056
Let's take a look at the install


1936
00:56:19,056 --> 00:56:19,996
application command.


1937
00:56:20,856 --> 00:56:24,046
On the right-hand side, you'll


1938
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:25,376
notice that we list all of the


1939
00:56:25,376 --> 00:56:27,166
platforms and the corresponding


1940
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:28,466
OS releases where this feature


1941
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:28,966
was added.


1942
00:56:30,236 --> 00:56:31,426
On the left-hand side, you can


1943
00:56:31,426 --> 00:56:32,826
see that we document the command


1944
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:34,986
itself, as well as the response,


1945
00:56:36,216 --> 00:56:37,876
and below that, on the command


1946
00:56:37,876 --> 00:56:39,266
availability table, that shows


1947
00:56:39,266 --> 00:56:40,426
you all the different ways that


1948
00:56:40,426 --> 00:56:41,786
this command can be implemented.


1949
00:56:42,656 --> 00:56:43,816
So, let's take a look at the


1950
00:56:43,816 --> 00:56:45,246
actual MDM command itself.


1951
00:56:50,766 --> 00:56:51,926
All right, here, you can see a


1952
00:56:51,926 --> 00:56:53,336
list of all of the keys that


1953
00:56:53,336 --> 00:56:54,856
make up the install application


1954
00:56:54,856 --> 00:56:55,286
command.


1955
00:56:55,786 --> 00:56:58,146
So finally, I'd like to talk a


1956
00:56:58,146 --> 00:56:58,986
little bit about how we've


1957
00:56:58,986 --> 00:57:00,286
documented the changes for user


1958
00:57:00,286 --> 00:57:00,776
enrollments.


1959
00:57:01,396 --> 00:57:02,856
The availability tables are a


1960
00:57:02,856 --> 00:57:04,176
great way for you to see if a


1961
00:57:04,476 --> 00:57:05,686
feature is supported in User


1962
00:57:05,686 --> 00:57:07,506
Enrollment, but in some cases,


1963
00:57:07,506 --> 00:57:08,706
we've had to change the way that


1964
00:57:08,706 --> 00:57:10,816
specific keys behave, and the


1965
00:57:10,816 --> 00:57:12,216
restrictions payload is a great


1966
00:57:12,216 --> 00:57:13,296
example of this.


1967
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:15,896
So here, you can see that we've


1968
00:57:15,896 --> 00:57:17,756
added help text to each key to


1969
00:57:17,756 --> 00:57:18,976
tell you how it can be used.


1970
00:57:19,276 --> 00:57:20,946
The Allow Account Modification


1971
00:57:20,946 --> 00:57:22,576
restriction, for example, can be


1972
00:57:22,576 --> 00:57:24,646
used on a supervised device and


1973
00:57:24,646 --> 00:57:26,586
is available on iOS 7 or later.


1974
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:28,746
We know that for BYOD


1975
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:30,566
enrollments, Managed Open In is


1976
00:57:30,566 --> 00:57:31,706
one of our most important


1977
00:57:31,706 --> 00:57:32,266
restrictions.


1978
00:57:32,776 --> 00:57:33,966
So, let's take a look how that's


1979
00:57:33,996 --> 00:57:34,886
been implemented.


1980
00:57:35,616 --> 00:57:37,096
Here you can see that this is


1981
00:57:37,096 --> 00:57:39,966
available for iOS 7 or later and


1982
00:57:40,276 --> 00:57:41,576
also available for user


1983
00:57:41,576 --> 00:57:42,036
enrollments.


1984
00:57:42,466 --> 00:57:44,086
Well, we're really excited for


1985
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,056
you take a look at all this new


1986
00:57:45,056 --> 00:57:46,746
documentation, and with that, a


1987
00:57:46,746 --> 00:57:47,656
hand it back to you, Todd.

1989
00:57:51,626 --> 00:57:52,636
Thank you very much, Graham.


1990
00:57:53,926 --> 00:57:55,196
Again, we're really excited for


1991
00:57:55,196 --> 00:57:56,746
this and hope you will go check


1992
00:57:56,746 --> 00:57:57,836
it out if you haven't already.


1993
00:57:57,836 --> 00:57:59,046
It's been live since Monday.


1994
00:57:59,596 --> 00:58:01,836
All right, will that brings us


1995
00:58:01,836 --> 00:58:03,236
to the end of our content.


1996
00:58:03,296 --> 00:58:04,896
So again, we hope that new


1997
00:58:04,896 --> 00:58:06,086
documentation makes it much


1998
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:07,076
easier for you to support


1999
00:58:07,076 --> 00:58:08,196
everything new, which of course,


2000
00:58:08,196 --> 00:58:10,026
we want you to do, and stop


2001
00:58:10,026 --> 00:58:12,186
relying on UserAgent string or


2002
00:58:12,186 --> 00:58:13,126
installing supervised


2003
00:58:13,126 --> 00:58:14,816
restrictions on unsupervised


2004
00:58:14,816 --> 00:58:15,496
devices.


2005
00:58:17,056 --> 00:58:18,706
There's a lot of helpful links


2006
00:58:18,706 --> 00:58:20,176
to that documentation, as well


2007
00:58:20,176 --> 00:58:21,596
as many other resources at the


2008
00:58:21,596 --> 00:58:23,736
session URL on-screen.


2009
00:58:23,996 --> 00:58:25,176
Come see us in the lab after


2010
00:58:25,176 --> 00:58:26,896
lunch, and check out those


2011
00:58:26,896 --> 00:58:27,886
sessions that we referred to


2012
00:58:27,886 --> 00:58:29,176
during the session on universal


2013
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:31,186
links and desktop browsing on


2014
00:58:31,436 --> 00:58:32,976
iPad.


2015
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:33,846
I want to thank all of you for


2016
00:58:33,846 --> 00:58:34,846
coming out this morning.


2017
00:58:34,846 --> 00:58:35,936
I hope you enjoy the rest of


2018
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:38,626
this final day of WW2019.


2019
00:58:38,946 --> 00:58:39,556
