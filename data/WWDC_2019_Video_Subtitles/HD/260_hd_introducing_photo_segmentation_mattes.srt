2
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,626
>> Hi. I'm Jacob.


3
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:14,046
I'm here to tell you about the


4
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:15,396
Semantic Segmentation Mattes.


5
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:17,486
So, first, I'm going to go


6
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:18,676
through what are these new types


7
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:19,226
of mattes.


8
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:20,436
And then, David is going to talk


9
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:21,956
you through how to leverage a


10
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:23,156
core image to work with these


11
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,316
new mattes.


12
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:27,846
So, remember in iOS 12, we


13
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:29,016
introduced the Portrait Effect


14
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:29,236
Matte?


15
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:31,376
So, this was a matte designed


16
00:00:31,376 --> 00:00:33,466
explicitly to provide effects


17
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:34,516
for portraits.


18
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:36,836
So, we use it internally to


19
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,046
render beautiful looking


20
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:39,806
portrait mode photos and


21
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:40,676
portrait lighting photos.


22
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:44,026
So, in taking a closer look at


23
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:45,906
the Portrait effect in matte,


24
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:48,236
you can see how that clearly


25
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:49,616
delineates the foreground


26
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,356
subject from the background.


27
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:52,946
So, this is beautifully


28
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:54,766
represented here as a black and,


29
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:55,676
black and white matte.


30
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:57,456
So, values of 1 indicating


31
00:00:57,656 --> 00:00:59,236
foreground and values of zero


32
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:00,746
indicating background.


33
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:04,126
In iOS 13, we are taking this a


34
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:05,186
step further with Semantic


35
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:06,166
Segmentation Mattes.


36
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:09,000
So, we're introducing hair,


37
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:12,660
skin,


38
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:15,666
and teeth.


39
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:18,976
So, taking a closer look at the


40
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:20,526
hair matte, for instance, you


41
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:22,546
can see how this is beautifully


42
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:25,006
separating the hair region from


43
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:25,906
the non-hair regions.


44
00:01:26,256 --> 00:01:28,126
So, we get great hair details


45
00:01:28,126 --> 00:01:29,176
against the background.


46
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,636
And we get great separation


47
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:32,036
between the non-hair regions


48
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:34,566
and-- and the hair.


49
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:35,956
Similarly, for the skin regions


50
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:37,496
where now we have alpha values


51
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:39,356
indicating how much of a pixel


52
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:41,676
is of type skin.


53
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:43,736
So, so an alpha value of .7, for


54
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:44,776
instance, would indicate that,


55
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:47,056
that a pixel is 70% of type


56
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:47,386
skin.


57
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:49,546
So, we hope these new three


58
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:51,226
types, three new types of mattes


59
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:52,656
will give you the creative


60
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:55,076
freedom to, to render some cool


61
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:56,586
effects and beautiful looking


62
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:57,000
photos.


63
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:01,006
So, a few things to note is that


64
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:02,446
the mattes are half size of the


65
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:03,206
original image.


66
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:05,076
That means they are half in each


67
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:06,406
dimension of the original image.


68
00:02:06,406 --> 00:02:07,376
And that means quarter


69
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:07,816
resolution.


70
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:10,536
So, another thing to remember is


71
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:11,986
that-- that these segmentation


72
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:13,196
mattes can actually overlap.


73
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:15,046
So, this is particularly true


74
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:16,106
for the Portrait Effects Matte


75
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:17,026
and the Skin Matte that will


76
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:18,566
inherently overlap.


77
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:23,146
So, these mattes do not come for


78
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:23,526
free.


79
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:24,736
So, we heavily leveraged the


80
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:26,316
Apple Neural Engines for machine


81
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:27,576
learning spectral graph theory.


82
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,526
And looking a bit under the hood


83
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:31,586
what we do is we take the


84
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:32,546
original size image.


85
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:33,526
We feed it through the Apple


86
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:35,016
Neural Engine and together with


87
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:36,906
the original sized image, we, we


88
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,256
render these high-resolution,


89
00:02:38,546 --> 00:02:40,376
high-quality with high


90
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:42,036
consistency segmentation mattes.


91
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,296
These are then ready to be


92
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,506
embedded into the HEIF or JPG


93
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:46,236
files as you know them, together


94
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:47,456
with the original sized image


95
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:48,886
and the Depth, as you know, from


96
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:49,496
iOS 11.


97
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:53,546
So, there are two distinct ways


98
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:55,876
to generate these two types of


99
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:56,216
mattes.


100
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:57,466
So, so one is that they're


101
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,616
embedded in all Portrait Mode


102
00:02:58,616 --> 00:02:59,216
captures.


103
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:00,596
So, you can grab them from those


104
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:01,016
files.


105
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:02,816
Or even better, you can write


106
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,236
your won capture app and opt


107
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:05,566
into these mattes on capture.


108
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,506
So, if you have files with the


109
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:09,466
segmentation mattes in them, you


110
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:10,926
can work with them through Core


111
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:12,026
Image and Image I/O.


112
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:13,536
David's going to talk more about


113
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:13,916
that.


114
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:16,356
But first, I'm going to talk you


115
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:17,736
through how to capture with AV


116
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:19,216
Foundation API.


117
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:23,516
There are four phases we're


118
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:24,536
going to go through here that


119
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:25,646
relates to the extension.


120
00:03:25,696 --> 00:03:27,336
So, first, is when we set up the


121
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:28,416
AVCapturePhotoOutput.


122
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,306
So, again, is when the capture


123
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:31,886
request is being initiated and


124
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:33,146
any point in the lifecycle of


125
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:34,736
your app.


126
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:35,966
Then, two of the callbacks.


127
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:37,376
So, one is when the settings are


128
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:38,716
resolved for your capture.


129
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:40,476
And the final one is the when


130
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:42,186
the Photo did finish processing.


131
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,116
So, for, for full details on


132
00:03:44,116 --> 00:03:45,726
this, please, refer to Brad's


133
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,000
2017 talk on this exact topic.


134
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:52,356
Let's go through how to set up


135
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:53,926
AVCapturePhotoOutput.


136
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:55,116
So, this usually happens when


137
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:56,436
you're, you're setting, you're


138
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,356
configuring your session.


139
00:03:57,356 --> 00:03:59,726
So, you've already at this point


140
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:00,646
on session dot begin


141
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:01,856
configuration, you've set your


142
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:02,406
presets.


143
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:03,956
You've added your device inputs,


144
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:05,026
you add your


145
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:06,016
AVCapturePhotoOutput.


146
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:07,606
At this point is when you, when


147
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:09,856
you tell the API what superset


148
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,016
of segmentation mattes are you


149
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:12,316
going to ask for at any point in


150
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:13,806
the lifecycle of your app.


151
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:16,156
When you actually want to


152
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,375
initiate your capture request,


153
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,416
you need to specify the


154
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,406
AVCapturePhoto setting.


155
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:21,836
So, this, this is where you tell


156
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:23,436
the API this is what I really


157
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:24,816
want in this particular capture.


158
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:26,756
So, here again, you can specify


159
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:28,086
all the ones that you already


160
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:28,466
enabled.


161
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,466
Or you can specify a subset, say


162
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:31,116
hair or skin.


163
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:33,966
Now, you initiate your capture


164
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:34,316
request.


165
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:35,706
So, you give it the


166
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:36,816
AVCapturePhoto settings and you


167
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:38,106
give it the delegate where you


168
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:39,236
want to have your callbacks.


169
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:43,926
So, time passes and soon after


170
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:45,386
you get that, get a


171
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,166
willBeginCaptureFor callback.


172
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:49,006
This is when, this is when the


173
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:51,236
API tells you, you may have


174
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:52,296
asked for something but this is


175
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:53,116
what you're actually going to


176
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:53,206
get.


177
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:54,976
So, this is important for the


178
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,036
Portrait Effects Matte and the


179
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:57,136
Semantic Segmentation Mattes


180
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,436
because if there are no people


181
00:04:58,436 --> 00:04:59,826
in the scene, you'll actually


182
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:00,576
not get a matte here.


183
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:02,346
So, you need to check for the


184
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,856
dimension of the-- dimensions of


185
00:05:03,856 --> 00:05:04,826
the Semantic Segmentation


186
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:05,046
Mattes.


187
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:09,346
They'll be zero, in such case.


188
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:10,586
More time passes.


189
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,316
The photo did finish processing.


190
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:14,876
So, this is when you get your


191
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:17,376
AV-- AVSemanticSegmentationMatte


192
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:17,646
back.


193
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:18,706
This is the variable matte, in


194
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:19,196
this case.


195
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,796
So, this new class have the same


196
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:23,876
type of methods and properties


197
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:24,916
as you know from the Portrait


198
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:25,316
Effects Matte.


199
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:26,706
That means you can rotate


200
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:27,656
according to Exif data.


201
00:05:27,656 --> 00:05:29,296
You can get your CVPixelBuffer


202
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,016
reference or you can get a


203
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:32,416
dictionary representation for


204
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,596
each file I/O.


205
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:38,446
So, for a full walkthrough of


206
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:40,016
the lifecycle of, of how to make


207
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:41,536
these captures, please refer to


208
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:42,946
the AVCam sample app.


209
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:44,526
It has been updated with the


210
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:45,786
Semantic Segmentation Mattes and


211
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:47,376
will take you through all these


212
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:48,576
different steps.


213
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:51,696
I'm going to hand it over to


214
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:53,006
David who is going to talk about


215
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:53,776
the Core Image.


216
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:59,576
[ Applause ]


217
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:00,466
>> All right.


218
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:01,466
Thank you very much.


219
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:02,456
Now that we've learned how to


220
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:04,256
capture images with Semantic


221
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:05,696
Segmentation Mattes, we get to


222
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:07,266
have some fun and learn how we


223
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,456
can leverage Core Image to apply


224
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:10,536
some fun effects.


225
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:12,756
Now, I'm going to have a demo


226
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:13,496
next.


227
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:14,686
But I should warn you if--


228
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,386
there's clowns in this image.


229
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:18,736
So, if you have any coulrophobia


230
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,716
or irrational fear of clowns,


231
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:22,896
you know, avert your eyes.


232
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:23,626
All right.


233
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:24,616
So, here we have an image that


234
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:26,846
was captured in Portrait Mode on


235
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:27,346
a device.


236
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:29,406
And what we can see in this


237
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,656
application is that we can now


238
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:33,096
very easily see all the


239
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,476
different Semantic Segmentation


240
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:35,696
Mattes that are present in this


241
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:36,076
file.


242
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:39,086
We can use the-- the traditional


243
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:42,186
Portrait Effects Matte or we can


244
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:45,416
also see the Skin Matte or we


245
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,736
can see-- the Hair Matte or the


246
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:48,336
Teeth Matte.


247
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:50,466
And it's also possible to use


248
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,736
Core Image to combine these


249
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:53,476
various mattes into other


250
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,046
mattes, such as this one I've


251
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:57,096
synthesized by using logical


252
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:59,676
operations to create a matte of


253
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:00,556
just eyes and mouth.


254
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:02,776
If we go back to the main image,


255
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:04,006
however, we see this is a


256
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,046
picture of me in Apple Park.


257
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:07,486
And one of the great things you


258
00:07:07,486 --> 00:07:09,306
could do with Semantic-- with


259
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:11,586
Portrait Effects Mattes is you


260
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:13,336
could add a background very


261
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:13,976
easily.


262
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:15,656
As you can see here, we can put


263
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:17,586
me in a circus tent.


264
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:19,486
And while that really does look


265
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:21,666
like a circus tent, I don't look


266
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,476
like I fit in.


267
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:24,586
So, now we can use some fun


268
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:25,086
effects.


269
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:27,126
For example, we can make it look


270
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,466
like I've got some clown makeup


271
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:28,706
on.


272
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,476
Or if we want to go a little


273
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:33,486
further, we can give myself some


274
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,096
green hair.


275
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:35,716
And lastly, we can use some of


276
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:37,006
these other mattes to give


277
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:37,896
myself some makeup.


278
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,596
So, that's what I'd like to talk


279
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:42,746
to you about today, is how we


280
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:43,566
can do these kinds of fun


281
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:44,726
effects in your application.


282
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:50,546
[ Applause ]


283
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:51,396
All right.


284
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:54,436
So, most of the clown references


285
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:55,536
are gone now so it's safe to


286
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:56,646
look back.


287
00:07:57,396 --> 00:07:58,016
All right.


288
00:07:58,016 --> 00:07:58,796
So, we're going to be talking


289
00:07:58,796 --> 00:07:59,856
about three things today.


290
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:01,846
One is how you create matte


291
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:04,146
images using Core Image, how you


292
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:05,436
can apply filters to those


293
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:07,426
images, and lastly, how you can


294
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:08,696
save these into files.


295
00:08:09,186 --> 00:08:10,626
So, firstly, let's talk about


296
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:12,946
creating matte images using Core


297
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:13,206
Image.


298
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:14,316
There are two ways.


299
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:15,886
One if you can create matte


300
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:18,116
images by using the


301
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:19,616
AVCapturePhoto APIs.


302
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:21,696
And then, from that, you can


303
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,526
create a Core Image.


304
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:25,086
So, the code for this is very


305
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:25,486
simple.


306
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:26,796
What we're going to be doing is


307
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:28,226
using the Semantic Segmentation


308
00:08:28,226 --> 00:08:30,416
Matte API and specifying that we


309
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,275
want either the hair or the skin


310
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:32,866
or the teeth.


311
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:34,946
And that returns an


312
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,645
AVSemanticSegmentationMatte


313
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:37,176
object.


314
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:39,356
And from that, it's trivial to


315
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:41,275
create a CIImage or we can just


316
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:43,196
substantiate a CIImage from that


317
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:43,686
object.


318
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:46,036
The other common way you're


319
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:47,096
going to want to create matte


320
00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:49,136
images is by loading them from a


321
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:50,836
HEIF or a JPG file.


322
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,526
These files have a main image


323
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:54,476
which you're familiar with, a


324
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:56,036
typical RGB image.


325
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:57,956
But they also have auxiliary


326
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:59,516
images such as the Portrait


327
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:01,736
Effects Matte as well as the new


328
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:03,696
mattes that we're talking about,


329
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:06,216
the Skin Segmentation Matte and


330
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:07,216
the Hair and the Teeth.


331
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,306
The code for this is very


332
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:09,706
simple.


333
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:11,606
The traditional code to create a


334
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:14,036
CIImage from a HEIF file is just


335
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:16,076
to say CIImage and specify a


336
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:16,316
URL.


337
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,566
To create these auxiliary


338
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,236
images, all you do is make the


339
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:22,166
same call and provide an options


340
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:24,136
dictionary specifying which


341
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:26,196
matte image you want to return.


342
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:27,796
So, we can specify the


343
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:29,866
auxiliarySegmentationHairMatte.


344
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:32,396
Or if we want, we can get the


345
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,526
mattes for the other Semantic


346
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:35,316
Segmentations.


347
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:37,416
So, very simple.


348
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,426
Just couple lines of code.


349
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:42,016
The next thing we want to do is


350
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,246
talk about how you can apply


351
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:44,686
effects to these images.


352
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,906
So, I showed a bunch of effects.


353
00:09:46,906 --> 00:09:48,086
I'm going to talk about one in a


354
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:49,006
little bit of detail.


355
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,186
What we're going to do is we're


356
00:09:51,186 --> 00:09:52,666
going to start with a base RGB


357
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,206
image.


358
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:54,716
And then, we're going to apply


359
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:55,716
some effect to that.


360
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,366
Let's say we want to do the


361
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:00,196
washed-out clown white makeup.


362
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:01,876
So, I'm going to apply some


363
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:02,836
adjustments to that.


364
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:04,376
Those adjustments, however,


365
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:05,976
apply to the entire image so we


366
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:07,766
want those to be limited to just


367
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:08,406
the skin area.


368
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,526
So, we're going to use the Skin


369
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:11,946
Matte and then, we're going to


370
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,466
combine these three images to


371
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:14,736
produce the result we want.


372
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,526
Let me walk you through the code


373
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:18,506
for it because it's actually


374
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:19,006
quite simple.


375
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:21,536
But first, I want to talk about


376
00:10:21,576 --> 00:10:22,756
the top feature request we've


377
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,296
had for Core Image which is to


378
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:25,536
make it easier for people to


379
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:28,106
discover and use the 200 plus


380
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:29,386
built-in filters we have.


381
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:31,216
And that is the new header


382
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:32,596
called Core mage


383
00:10:32,686 --> 00:10:33,936
CIFilterBuiltins.


384
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,866
And these allow you to use all


385
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,106
of the built-in filters without


386
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:38,836
having to remember the names of


387
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:40,026
the filters for the names of the


388
00:10:40,026 --> 00:10:40,366
input.


389
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:41,836
So.


390
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,806
[ Applause ]


391
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:46,116
It's-- it's really great.


392
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:48,046
So, let me show you some code


393
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:49,056
that will use this new header.


394
00:10:49,726 --> 00:10:50,576
So, the first thing we're going


395
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:51,966
to do is create the base image.


396
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:52,856
And we're just going to call it


397
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:54,196
image with contents of URL.


398
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:56,006
And that will produce the


399
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:57,356
traditional RGB image.


400
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,296
Now, we're going to start


401
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:00,306
applying some effects.


402
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:01,486
So, the first thing I want to do


403
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:02,436
is I'm going to convert it to


404
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:04,296
grayscale and I'm going to use a


405
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,026
filter called the


406
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:06,016
maximumComponent.


407
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:08,116
And I'm going to give that


408
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:09,576
filter an input image of the


409
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:10,216
base image.


410
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:11,926
And then, I'm going to ask for


411
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:13,036
that filter's output.


412
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,056
And that produces the image that


413
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:16,416
looks grayscale like this.


414
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:18,716
This doesn't look quite bright


415
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:20,066
enough to look like clown


416
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:20,436
makeup.


417
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:21,636
So, we're going to apply an


418
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:22,446
additional filter.


419
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:23,926
We're going to say use the gamma


420
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:24,766
adjustment filter.


421
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:26,896
And the input to this will be


422
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,686
the previous filter's output.


423
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:30,386
And then, we're going to specify


424
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,656
the power for the gamma function


425
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:35,296
and ask for the output image.


426
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,466
And you'll notice it's now very


427
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:39,716
easy to specify the power for


428
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:40,506
the gamma filter.


429
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,086
It's a Float rather than having


430
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:43,556
to remember to use NSNumber.


431
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:47,106
So, that's the first part of our


432
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:47,386
effect.


433
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:51,146
The next thing we want to do is


434
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,046
start by getting this Skin


435
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:54,876
Segmentation Matte.


436
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:56,286
So, again, as I described


437
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,286
earlier, we're going to start


438
00:11:57,286 --> 00:11:59,036
with the URL to specify that we


439
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:00,746
want the Skin Matte.


440
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:03,366
However, when we get this image,


441
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,226
notice it's smaller than the


442
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:05,716
other image.


443
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:06,716
As we mentioned before, these


444
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:07,866
are half size by default.


445
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:11,096
So, we need to scale it up to


446
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:12,626
match the image, main image


447
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:12,916
size.


448
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:14,176
So, we're going to create a


449
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:15,666
CGAffineTransform that scales


450
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,956
from the matte's size to the


451
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:18,146
base image size.


452
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:20,216
And then, we're going to apply a


453
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:21,416
transform to the image.


454
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,726
And that produces a new image


455
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,906
which, as you expect, matches


456
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:25,726
the correct size.


457
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:28,466
The next step we're going to do


458
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,586
is start combining these two.


459
00:12:31,536 --> 00:12:32,596
And we're going to use the


460
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:33,946
blendWithMask filter.


461
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:35,176
And this is great and we use


462
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:36,536
this throughout the sample I


463
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:36,936
just showed.


464
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:38,966
We're going to specify the


465
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,416
background image to be the base


466
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:42,776
RGB image which looks like this.


467
00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:44,836
Next, we're going to specify the


468
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:46,506
input image which will be the


469
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:48,126
foreground image which is the


470
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:49,986
image which has the-- the white


471
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:50,726
makeup applied.


472
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:52,426
And lastly, we're going to


473
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:55,716
specify a mask image which is


474
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:57,346
the image that I showed


475
00:12:58,046 --> 00:12:58,496
previously.


476
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:00,756
Given these three inputs, you


477
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:02,246
can ask the blend filter for its


478
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,096
output and the result looks like


479
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:04,446
this.


480
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:06,056
Now, as you can see, this is


481
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:06,926
just the starting point.


482
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:07,936
You can combine all sort of


483
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,036
interesting effects to produce


484
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:10,966
great results in your


485
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:11,466
application.


486
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:15,396
Once you're done applying these


487
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:16,426
effects, you want to save them.


488
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:18,936
And, most typically, you want to


489
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:21,046
save them as a HEIF or a JPG


490
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,476
file which supports saving


491
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:24,406
auxiliary images, as well.


492
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:26,196
So, in addition to the main


493
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,006
image, you can also store the


494
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:30,006
Semantic Segmentation Mattes so


495
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:31,716
that either your application or


496
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:33,456
other applications can apply


497
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:34,366
additional effects.


498
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:37,216
The code for this is very


499
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:37,586
simple.


500
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:39,776
You use the Core Image API


501
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:41,366
writeHEIFRepresentation.


502
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:43,606
And typically, you specify the


503
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,276
main image, the URL that you


504
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,136
want to save it to, and then the


505
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:49,766
pixel format that you want it to


506
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:51,646
be saved as, and the colorSpace


507
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:52,656
you want it to be saved as.


508
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:54,226
And what I want to highlight


509
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:56,166
today is another set of options


510
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,506
that you can provide when you're


511
00:13:57,506 --> 00:13:58,326
saving the image.


512
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,546
So, for example, you can specify


513
00:14:00,546 --> 00:14:01,036
the key


514
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:02,756
semanticSegmentationSkinMatte


515
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:05,686
and specify the skinImage or the


516
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,386
hairImage or the teethImage.


517
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,036
And all four of these images


518
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:10,536
will be saved into the resulting


519
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,246
HEIF or JPG file.


520
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,686
Now, there's an alternate way of


521
00:14:14,746 --> 00:14:16,726
getting this result, which is,


522
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:18,086
if you want, you can save the


523
00:14:18,086 --> 00:14:20,626
main images and specify the


524
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,936
segmentation mattes as


525
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:23,646
AVSemanticSegmentationMatte


526
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:24,196
objects.


527
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,066
This again, the API is very


528
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:26,456
simple.


529
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:29,016
You specify the-- the URL, the


530
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:31,056
primary image, the pixel format,


531
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,306
and the color space.


532
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,126
In this case, if you want to


533
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:35,486
specify these objects to be


534
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:37,776
saved in the file, you just say


535
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,376
AVSemanticSegmentationMattes and


536
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:40,986
you provide an array of mattes.


537
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,676
So, that's what you can do using


538
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,776
Core Image with these mattes.


539
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:48,296
What I talked about today is how


540
00:14:48,296 --> 00:14:50,646
to create images for-- for


541
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:52,456
mattes, how to apply filters,


542
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:53,436
and how to save them.


543
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:54,906
I will, however, mention that


544
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:56,616
the sample app I showed you has


545
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:58,316
been written as a Photos App


546
00:14:58,316 --> 00:14:58,796
plug-in.


547
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:00,236
And if you want to learn about


548
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,346
how you can do that in your


549
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:03,176
application so that you can save


550
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:04,596
these images, not just to HEIFs


551
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:06,226
but, also, into the user's Photo


552
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:08,596
library, I recommend you consult


553
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:10,326
these earlier presentations.


554
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,846
Especially, the "Introduction to


555
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:13,836
the Photos Frameworks" from WWDC


556
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:16,866
in 2014.


557
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:17,276
All right.


558
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:18,556
And thank you all, very much, I


559
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:19,606
really look forward to seeing


560
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:20,436
what you do with these great


561
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:20,636
features.


562
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:20,866
Thanks.
