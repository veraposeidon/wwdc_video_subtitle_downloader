00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:08,226
>> Hello. I'm Ben Harry from the


3
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:09,466
Game Center Engineering team.


4
00:00:09,546 --> 00:00:12,166
In this presentation, I'm going


5
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,546
to talk about Game Center player


6
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:14,346
identifiers.


7
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:17,716
To get started, I'm going to


8
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:19,156
give you a brief overview of


9
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:20,426
what Game Center offers to the


10
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:21,486
players of your games.


11
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:24,856
Game Center is a social gaming


12
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:26,306
network that allows players to


13
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,496
track their best scores on


14
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:28,946
leaderboards, view their


15
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,396
achievements earned playing your


16
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:32,625
games, challenge their friends


17
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,226
to complete an achievement or to


18
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:36,876
beat a leaderboard score, and


19
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:38,156
play either real-time or


20
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:39,616
turn-based multiplayer games


21
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:40,416
with their friends.


22
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:44,116
At the heart of Game Center


23
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:45,466
games are the players.


24
00:00:47,096 --> 00:00:48,316
Players are represented by


25
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:49,606
objects that contain unique


26
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:51,296
information that differentiate


27
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:52,586
one player from another.


28
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,326
The object used to represent


29
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:56,606
Game Center players is the


30
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:57,466
GKPlayer.


31
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,296
Every GKPlayer has a unique


32
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:02,976
nickname accessed by the alias


33
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,476
property.


34
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,346
A player may also choose an


35
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:07,876
avatar image that will be used


36
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,326
within Game Center UIs.


37
00:01:09,796 --> 00:01:12,546
In addition, each Game Center


38
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:13,986
user has a unique static


39
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:15,996
identifier that remains the same


40
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:17,496
across all games that the player


41
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:17,986
plays.


42
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:20,896
You may use this identifier to


43
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,516
store per-player information.


44
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:27,896
Let me now talk about how a


45
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:29,316
player static identifier


46
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:30,666
currently works in Game Center.


47
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:33,346
You may already be familiar with


48
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:35,246
this, but let us consider this


49
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,696
example in case you need to


50
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:37,596
refresh your memory.


51
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,896
Here we have two teams, Team A


52
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:41,846
and Team B.


53
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,836
In this presentation, I will be


54
00:01:44,836 --> 00:01:46,746
using the term team to represent


55
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:48,716
a development team that releases


56
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:50,276
a game to the App Store using


57
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,276
App Store Connect.


58
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:54,486
So, I have been playing two


59
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:56,376
games from Team A and I also


60
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:57,836
really enjoy the game from Team


61
00:01:57,836 --> 00:01:58,136
B.


62
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,296
As we see, my static Game Center


63
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:03,086
identifier is P123.


64
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:05,466
Each of these games we'll see


65
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:06,836
the same value from my


66
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,636
identifier P123.


67
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:11,476
No matter which game I play, I


68
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:13,496
had the same static identifier.


69
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:16,546
Going forward, we now want to


70
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:18,246
increase privacy by introducing


71
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:20,386
new player identifiers that are


72
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:22,116
scoped to the either the team or


73
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:23,146
the game itself.


74
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:26,656
So let's begin with the first of


75
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,486
these new identifiers, the team


76
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:29,256
player ID.


77
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:32,306
Remember that team refers to the


78
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:34,026
development team that releases a


79
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:35,186
game to the App Store.


80
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,816
Again, consider Team A and Team


81
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:40,776
B along with the same games from


82
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:41,276
before.


83
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:44,486
Notice that now I have two


84
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:45,616
different identifiers.


85
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:47,546
When I play either game from


86
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:49,566
Team A, the value of my team


87
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:50,976
player ID will be T11.


88
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:53,446
When I play the game from Team


89
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:55,486
B, the value of my team player


90
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:57,216
ID will be T22.


91
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,196
This means that the value of my


92
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:02,236
team player ID scoped to the


93
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:03,836
team that releases the game I


94
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:04,226
play.


95
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:07,536
This is an improvement to player


96
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:10,236
privacy as Team A will only know


97
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:12,966
my team player ID as T11, and


98
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:14,686
Team B will only know my team


99
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:16,316
player ID as T22.


100
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,926
So this is the team player ID.


101
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:22,416
I now want to tell you about our


102
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,066
other new player identifier, the


103
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,106
game player ID.


104
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:29,636
The game player ID is unique per


105
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:30,526
game per player.


106
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:33,416
This means that my game player


107
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,396
ID is unique to each game that I


108
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:35,816
play.


109
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:39,276
Its value is also independent


110
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:40,566
from the team that releases the


111
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:40,926
game.


112
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:44,446
Let us go back to our familiar


113
00:03:44,446 --> 00:03:46,556
teams, Team A and Team B.


114
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:49,406
As you can see here, my game


115
00:03:49,406 --> 00:03:51,206
player ID is different for each


116
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:53,846
game that I play, regardless of


117
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:54,856
which team has released the


118
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:55,156
game.


119
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:58,496
To further show how a game


120
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:00,146
player ID is independent from


121
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:01,976
the team, let's consider the


122
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,446
case when a game is transferred


123
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:04,666
from one team to another.


124
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:07,786
I am now going to show you what


125
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:09,556
happens to my scoped identifiers


126
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,396
when Game 2 is transferred from


127
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:12,706
Team A to Team B.


128
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:16,716
Let's say Team A transfers


129
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,866
ownership of Game 2 to Team B.


130
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,326
Now, when I play Game 2, my game


131
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:24,016
player ID for Game 2 remains


132
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:24,716
unchanged.


133
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,136
My game player ID for Game 2


134
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:29,876
persisted with the game and is


135
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:31,196
independent of the team.


136
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,266
Now, you may have also noticed


137
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:36,546
something about my team player


138
00:04:36,546 --> 00:04:37,606
ID for Game 2.


139
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,786
My team player ID for Game 2


140
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:42,526
took on the value for Team B


141
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:44,226
since it is now released to the


142
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:45,416
App Store by Team B.


143
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:49,176
So we have come to the scoping


144
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:50,086
of the new Game Center


145
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:51,456
identifiers and also what


146
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:52,886
happens to these identifiers


147
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:53,966
when game ownership is


148
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:54,596
transferred.


149
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:57,866
I am now going to talk about how


150
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,016
you may use the scope


151
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,456
identifiers in the games that


152
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:01,096
you develop.


153
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:05,636
As you have seen, we have added


154
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:07,296
two new scope identifiers to the


155
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:09,596
GKPlayer, the team player ID and


156
00:05:09,596 --> 00:05:10,766
the game player ID.


157
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:14,446
The team player ID and game


158
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:16,066
player ID have been introduced


159
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,156
with the goal of increasing


160
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:19,586
player privacy, which aligned to


161
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:20,666
the Apple's commitment to


162
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,256
protecting the privacy of our


163
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:22,786
users.


164
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:26,436
This new identifiers replaced


165
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:28,186
the existing static identifier


166
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:30,356
or player ID on a GKPlayer.


167
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:34,506
The playerID property is now


168
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:35,276
deprecated.


169
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:36,926
So I encourage you to start


170
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:37,836
using these new scope


171
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:38,886
identifiers today.


172
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:43,736
As I mentioned earlier, the team


173
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,256
player ID and game player ID


174
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:46,866
have been introduced to replace


175
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:48,036
the static player ID.


176
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,786
If you don't query the player ID


177
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:52,286
in your games, then you will not


178
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,716
need to make any changes.


179
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:56,716
If you do query the player ID,


180
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:58,386
you'll need to switch to the new


181
00:05:58,386 --> 00:05:59,566
scoped identifiers.


182
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,416
You'll be using the team player


183
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,616
ID in most cases.


184
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:06,846
Likewise, if you currently use


185
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:08,236
the static player ID to save


186
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,146
game data, you should move to


187
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,286
the team scoped ID.


188
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,576
Doing so will handle the


189
00:06:13,576 --> 00:06:15,086
situation in the device you


190
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:16,536
shared by multiple Game Center


191
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:17,116
players.


192
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,026
For those of you who may be


193
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,496
persisting the static player ID


194
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:24,116
in your own back end system, you


195
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,526
should also update to the new


196
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:26,736
scoped identifiers.


197
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,686
You can do this any time after a


198
00:06:29,686 --> 00:06:31,046
successful authentication.


199
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:35,086
Next, let me show you how scoped


200
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:36,716
identifiers look for their local


201
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:38,536
player as compared to non-local


202
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:39,126
players.


203
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:42,066
As you probably know, the


204
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:44,136
GKLocalPlayer is the object that


205
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,456
represents the authenticated


206
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:47,246
Game Center player on a device.


207
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:50,056
At any given time, only one


208
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:51,616
player may be authenticated.


209
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,536
And the GKLocalPlayer has a


210
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:56,096
persistent team player ID and


211
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:56,926
game player ID.


212
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,766
But what about the GKPlayer?


213
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,206
A GKPlayer object provides


214
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:03,956
information about other players.


215
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:06,686
These are non-local players and


216
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:08,186
may be found in leaderboards


217
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:09,706
recently played lists


218
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,026
multiplayer matches and so


219
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:11,386
forth.


220
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:14,306
The scoped identifiers for


221
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:16,266
GKPlayers will be instance based


222
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,876
on the context in which they are


223
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:18,346
used.


224
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:21,426
For example, their scope to each


225
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:22,796
instance of a leaderboard or


226
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:24,396
each instance of a multiplayer


227
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:26,656
match, which means that you


228
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,286
cannot count on them to persist


229
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:29,506
in subsequent matches.


230
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:33,756
Let's say you have your own


231
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:35,066
player accounting system.


232
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:36,496
In which case, you'll be loading


233
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:37,866
the corresponding GKPlayer


234
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:38,456
objects.


235
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:40,716
To do this, use the


236
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:42,326
loadPlayersForIdentifiers:


237
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:43,676
withCompletionHandler method


238
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:44,906
found on GKPlayer.


239
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:47,846
You may use either the team


240
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:49,646
player ID or the game player ID


241
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:51,006
for the identifiers.


242
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:54,496
When you use the new


243
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:56,246
identifiers, there is a very


244
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:58,036
rare case where the scoped


245
00:07:58,036 --> 00:07:59,126
identifiers will not be


246
00:07:59,126 --> 00:07:59,606
available.


247
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,196
So what should you do if the


248
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:03,506
scoped identifiers are not


249
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:03,956
available?


250
00:08:05,396 --> 00:08:06,986
Usually, when a player launches


251
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,516
one of your games, the scoped


252
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:10,246
identifiers for the local player


253
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:11,346
will be available after


254
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:12,636
successful authentication.


255
00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:16,296
However, there is a slim chance


256
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,806
that the scoped identifiers may


257
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:18,876
not be available.


258
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:21,696
For this case, we've added a new


259
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:23,046
API to GKPlayer.


260
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,256
Scoped IDs are persistent.


261
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,266
This property will be false if


262
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:29,206
they are not available.


263
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,416
This means that you'll need to


264
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,066
check this property before using


265
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:35,506
the team player ID or game


266
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:36,976
player ID for the local player.


267
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:40,206
So let's tie all this


268
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:41,416
information together by


269
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,025
considering an example of using


270
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,546
the scoped identifiers after


271
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:45,846
successful authentication.


272
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:49,396
As you know, when the


273
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,886
authenticate handler returns,


274
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:52,486
you need to check if Game Center


275
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:53,536
has returned you a view


276
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:54,086
controller.


277
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,666
If so, then you present the view


278
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,826
controller when convenient.


279
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,276
If there is no view controller


280
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,206
and the local player has


281
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:04,696
successfully authenticated, then


282
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,376
you will be able to use the


283
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:07,996
scoped identifiers after first


284
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:09,636
checking the scoped IDs are a


285
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:10,576
persistent value.


286
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,286
If you are persisting the player


287
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:17,166
ID in your own back end system,


288
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:19,116
now is when you should convert


289
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:20,596
from the old static identifier


290
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:22,296
to the new scope identifiers.


291
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:25,846
I will now wrap up by


292
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:26,736
summarizing what I have


293
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:27,496
presented today.


294
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:30,036
Game Center is introducing new


295
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,696
scoped identifiers with the goal


296
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,106
of increasing player privacy.


297
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,166
A player's team player ID is


298
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,586
scoped to your development team.


299
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:40,446
A player's game player ID is


300
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,716
scoped to a game and will


301
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:43,256
persist with that game if it is


302
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:44,496
transferred from one developer


303
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:45,066
to another.


304
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,436
Use these new scoped identifiers


305
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:50,096
in Game Center APIs as you will


306
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:51,186
use the player ID.


307
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:54,136
Both of these identifiers are


308
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,536
available now so start using


309
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:56,056
them today.


310
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,786
