00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:14,876
>> Good morning everyone.


3
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:16,976
>> Good morning.


4
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:19,576
>> My name is Jordyn Castor and


5
00:00:19,576 --> 00:00:21,056
I work here at Apple on the


6
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:23,146
Accessibility Design and Quality


7
00:00:23,146 --> 00:00:23,636
Team.


8
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:29,456
I'm so excited to be here today.


9
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:32,735
Accessibility is built into our


10
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:34,496
hardware and software design


11
00:00:34,676 --> 00:00:35,446
here at Apple.


12
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,356
We believe accessibility is a


13
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:41,606
human right and it's one of our


14
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:42,476
core values.


15
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:46,206
When I download an app, there's


16
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:48,566
an expectation that it just


17
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:49,356
works.


18
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,866
And I'm able to access all of


19
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:54,266
the buttons, controls, and


20
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:56,206
information using VoiceOver.


21
00:00:56,816 --> 00:00:59,386
To be honest, I give an app a


22
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,166
first 30 second glance and if I


23
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,776
can't access any of the


24
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:06,236
functionality, I delete it.


25
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:08,896
Now, I really, really want to


26
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:09,956
use your applications.


27
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,766
I do. But, one of the most


28
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:14,916
crucial aspects to our built-in


29
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:17,346
features like VoiceOver, Speak


30
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:20,496
Screen, and Voice Control being


31
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:22,156
able to access the functionality


32
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:24,406
of your app is by the labeling


33
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:26,186
of your buttons, and text


34
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,496
fields, controls, and other


35
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:29,026
elements.


36
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:33,866
So today, I'm going to talk to


37
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:35,956
you about what an accessibility


38
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:38,616
label is, understanding the


39
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:40,646
context for writing great


40
00:01:40,646 --> 00:01:43,496
labels, and best practices.


41
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:48,446
So, let's -- so what is an


42
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:49,556
accessibility label?


43
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:55,056
Well, the definition is pretty


44
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:55,456
short.


45
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:57,916
It's a localized string that


46
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,736
succinctly identifies the


47
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:01,096
accessibility element.


48
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,836
But let's unpack that a bit.


49
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:06,706
Identifies the accessibility


50
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:07,106
element.


51
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:09,466
What does that mean exactly?


52
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:12,906
It's a human readable, human


53
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:15,146
understandable label that gives


54
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:17,336
context and meaning for the


55
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:19,326
elements in your app.


56
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,756
And writing the code is pretty


57
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:23,466
simple too.


58
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:26,026
It's just getting or setting a


59
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:26,446
string.


60
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:28,826
But I get it.


61
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:30,496
It's actually pretty difficult


62
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:32,766
to accurately label the elements


63
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:34,306
in your app.


64
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:36,866
And as it turns out, that's all


65
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:38,286
about the context.


66
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,666
So that's what I'm going to help


67
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,066
you understand in the next few


68
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,026
minutes, is the importance of


69
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:48,486
understanding context.


70
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,776
So, let's dive right in.


71
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,256
What should the label of this


72
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:56,886
button be in your app?


73
00:02:57,556 --> 00:03:00,426
Well, by default it might be


74
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:01,116
called plus.


75
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:03,186
And I might be able to figure


76
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:03,896
out what you meant.


77
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:07,606
But, let's look at that with a


78
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:09,386
bit more context.


79
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:15,016
What about in a nav bar across


80
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:16,216
from a back button?


81
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:18,816
This is pretty common in iOS


82
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:19,016
apps.


83
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:21,296
What should the label of this


84
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:22,466
button be here?


85
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:27,296
Add? Well, that might be just


86
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:27,776
dandy.


87
00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:30,556
If I'm in a notes app and I hear


88
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:33,096
the word add, I'm going to know


89
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,276
that that's going to add a new


90
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:34,716
note.


91
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:37,366
But remember, these labels are


92
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:38,736
supposed to be succinct.


93
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:43,066
In a shopping context I might


94
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,756
need to clarify that a bit


95
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:47,066
further to distinguish this app


96
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:49,146
button from other actions like


97
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,546
Add to Favorites.


98
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:53,826
So, we might need to call that


99
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:54,466
Add to Cart.


100
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:58,716
And, what if there were dozens


101
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,246
of Add to Cart buttons?


102
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:02,806
In this context I might expect


103
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:05,036
VoiceOver to say, add peanut


104
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:05,946
butter to cart.


105
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:08,496
And hopefully it's not crunchy


106
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:09,636
peanut butter.


107
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:13,116
To bring it back to the original


108
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:15,056
example, what should the label


109
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:16,826
of this button be in your app?


110
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:24,326
Well, that all depends on the


111
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:25,976
context.


112
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:30,116
So, now let's talk about some


113
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:31,106
best practices when considering


114
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:32,986
what a label should be.


115
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:36,046
First and foremost, always,


116
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:38,066
always remember to add labels to


117
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,136
your apps.


118
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:40,016
This is crucial.


119
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:42,656
If a label's not added,


120
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:44,246
VoiceOver might speak something


121
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:44,646
like.


122
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,646
>> Button, button, button.


123
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:50,216
>> And for all I know guys, that


124
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:51,666
could be the Delete hard drive


125
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,966
Partition button and I wouldn't


126
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:54,596
want to press that.


127
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:58,696
If there is no label added and


128
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:00,396
if there's an image in the


129
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:01,926
button or if there's an image


130
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,096
within the button, VoiceOver


131
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,286
might speak something like --


132
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:08,186
>> Plus underscore icon


133
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,256
underscore outline underscore


134
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:10,156
hash nine, nine, nine, nine,


135
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:11,766
nine, nine, dot.


136
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,036
>> What? What does that even


137
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:14,546
mean?


138
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:20,006
So please, please guys, add


139
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:21,696
labels.


140
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,776
VoiceOver knows what the element


141
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:25,646
in your apps is based on the


142
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:26,396
element type.


143
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:30,216
So, it's redundant to add text


144
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:32,126
to your string like button or


145
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:32,566
tab.


146
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,486
And if you do, VoiceOver would


147
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:36,616
read out the label like --


148
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:38,486
>> Add button button.


149
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:41,086
>> Hearing this though --


150
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:42,666
>> Add button.


151
00:05:42,806 --> 00:05:43,986
>> Makes much more sense.


152
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:48,896
Remember to update the label


153
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:50,196
when the UI changes.


154
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:52,986
So, if you have an add button --


155
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:54,746
>> Add button.


156
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,366
>> That changes to a delete


157
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:56,756
button --


158
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:59,476
>> Delete button.


159
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:01,396
>> Remember to update your UI so


160
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:02,296
that the label, so that


161
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,536
VoiceOver will speak the correct


162
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:07,306
state of the button.


163
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,746
When there's multiple buttons


164
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:12,076
with the same action like adding


165
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:14,166
an item to the cart, remember to


166
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,426
provide the context.


167
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:18,716
Here it's not clear what I'm


168
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:19,076
adding.


169
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:20,866
>> Add button.


170
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:22,976
>> Am I adding the peanut


171
00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:26,526
butter, the bananas, or the


172
00:06:26,526 --> 00:06:27,146
cookies?


173
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:29,086
Oh, I love cookies.


174
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:32,506
The context is much more clear


175
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:33,216
here.


176
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:36,486
>> Add peanut butter button.


177
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:37,436
>> Oh, we're adding the peanut


178
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:37,926
butter.


179
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:39,696
Hopefully it's not crunchy.


180
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:45,226
Avoid redundant labels.


181
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:47,836
So, if I'm in a music player the


182
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:49,836
context is clear that we're


183
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:51,476
dealing with songs.


184
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,156
So, having VoiceOver speak --


185
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:56,966
>> Play song button.


186
00:06:56,966 --> 00:07:00,556
>> Or next song, is unnecessary.


187
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,786
I'd much rather hear VoiceOver


188
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:03,316
speak --


189
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:05,196
>> Play button.


190
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:08,176
>> Just the word play.


191
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:11,566
It's also great to add labels to


192
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:12,956
your animations, such as your


193
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:13,536
spinners.


194
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,306
So that VoiceOver will let me


195
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:17,146
know that the content in your


196
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,156
app is --


197
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:19,516
>> Loading.


198
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:20,156
>> Loading.


199
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:21,106
That's really important.


200
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:25,046
So, this --


201
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:27,496
>> Delete items from the current


202
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:28,726
folder and add it to the trash


203
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:29,096
button.


204
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:30,436
>> That is too verbose.


205
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:33,626
Remember, we want these labels


206
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,356
to be as succinct as possible.


207
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:39,516
And, the context really makes


208
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:41,226
things in your app clear.


209
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:42,406
So, this --


210
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,256
>> Delete button.


211
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:46,666
>> Would be just fine.


212
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:51,626
But verbosity isn't always a bad


213
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,156
thing though.


214
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:55,516
Oftentimes verbose descriptions


215
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:57,446
when in appropriate situations


216
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,136
is really what makes your app


217
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,746
fun and memorable.


218
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:02,886
The developers of the Cookie


219
00:08:02,886 --> 00:08:05,046
Monster sticker packs have added


220
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:07,876
verbose but really fun labels to


221
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:08,526
their stickers.


222
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:11,076
So now, VoiceOver speaks --


223
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:13,216
>> Me happy face eat small


224
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:15,456
cookie, om nom nom button.


225
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:16,856
>> I love that.


226
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:18,166
That is so awesome.


227
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:20,176
These Cookie Monster stickers


228
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:22,776
are intended to be fun and just


229
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,306
make a person smile.


230
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:26,556
Whether you can see the sticker


231
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:28,116
or you hear the label.


232
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,856
So, let's review.


233
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:35,846
Remember to add labels so that


234
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:37,846
VoiceOver doesn't speak "button,


235
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:39,586
button, button."


236
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:43,796
Don't include the element type


237
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:45,646
in your label because VoiceOver


238
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:47,516
gathers that info already.


239
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:50,616
So, hearing add button button is


240
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:51,576
unnecessary.


241
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,016
Update the labels when your UI


242
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:55,646
changes.


243
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:57,526
So, when you have that add


244
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,016
button that changes to a delete


245
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:00,906
button, remember to update your


246
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:02,396
label so VoiceOver reads the


247
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:03,836
correct state of the button.


248
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:09,236
Avoid redundancy like play song,


249
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:11,146
next song, previous song.


250
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,846
In a music player, remember to


251
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,516
provide enough context so I know


252
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:17,876
whether I'm adding peanut


253
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:19,586
butter, bananas, or those


254
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:20,976
awesome cookies to my cart.


255
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:26,066
Add labels to your meaningful


256
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,486
animations like spinners, so


257
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:30,876
that VoiceOver will read that


258
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,446
the content in your app is


259
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:35,986
loading or in progress.


260
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:39,416
Avoid verbose labels like delete


261
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,016
current item from the trash and


262
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,366
move it.


263
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:44,176
Unless you have a great reason


264
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:45,216
like those awesome Cookie


265
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:46,846
Monster stickers.


266
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:51,626
I really hope you've enjoyed


267
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,396
learning about best practices


268
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,586
for labeling your apps.


269
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,526
But if you're ever curious what


270
00:09:57,526 --> 00:09:58,676
your app would sound like to a


271
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:01,026
VoiceOver user, I really


272
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:03,266
encourage you to turn it on and


273
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,166
swipe around.


274
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:07,066
It's really a great opportunity


275
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:08,906
to improve your app for


276
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:09,386
everyone.


277
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:10,866
Thank you so much.
