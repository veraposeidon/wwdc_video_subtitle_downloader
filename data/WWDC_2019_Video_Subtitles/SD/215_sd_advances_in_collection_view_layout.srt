00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:14,886
>> Welcome.


4
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:16,346
My name is Steve Breen.


5
00:00:16,346 --> 00:00:17,856
I'm engineer on the UIKit team.


6
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:19,436
And I'm joined today by me


7
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,966
colleagues, Troy Stephens from


8
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,596
the AppKit team; and Dersu


9
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:24,036
Abolfathi [phonetic] from the


10
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:24,716
App Store team.


11
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:27,436
So today we're going to talk a


12
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,006
little bit about advances in


13
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:30,646
CollectionView layouts.


14
00:00:30,846 --> 00:00:31,486
Now, we're going to break the


15
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:32,926
talk down into four broad


16
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:33,536
segments.


17
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,376
First we're going to go over the


18
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:35,316
current state-of-the-art -- how


19
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:35,966
do we do this today?


20
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:38,076
How do we define CollectionView


21
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:39,456
layout in our applications?


22
00:00:40,436 --> 00:00:41,326
Then we're going to go over a


23
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:43,216
brand new approach that we're


24
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:44,406
bringing to all the platforms


25
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:46,066
this year -- iOS, tvOS, and the


26
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:46,256
Mac.


27
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:48,326
And then we're going to go on to


28
00:00:48,326 --> 00:00:49,956
some hands-on demos so you can


29
00:00:49,956 --> 00:00:51,556
see this API in action.


30
00:00:52,276 --> 00:00:53,526
And then we'll do a tour of some


31
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:55,136
more advanced features of how


32
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:56,586
you can get the most out of this


33
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:56,886
API.


34
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:01,276
All right, we got a ton of


35
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:01,746
content.


36
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:03,346
So let's get started.


37
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:04,476
All right.


38
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:06,306
So first let's talk a bit about


39
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:07,166
the current state of UI.


40
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:07,876
What do we do today?


41
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,596
How do we define CollectionView


42
00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:10,056
layout?


43
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:13,176
Now, when CollectionView was


44
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:15,206
introduced back in iOS 6, it has


45
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:17,006
a really novel concept; it had a


46
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:18,426
separate abstraction for


47
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:19,256
defining layout.


48
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:21,766
So it's really two classes


49
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:22,906
acting in concert with each


50
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:23,686
other, where one does a


51
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:25,626
rendering and one is responsible


52
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:27,056
for where things go or the


53
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:27,966
CollectionView layout.


54
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,256
Now, CollectionView layout is an


55
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,166
abstract thing.


56
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,676
So we have to subclass to get


57
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,306
use out of it.


58
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:35,416
And we shipped a concrete layout


59
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,336
class with iOS 6 called


60
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:38,576
CollectionView flow layout.


61
00:01:40,136 --> 00:01:41,696
Now, flow layout was really


62
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,476
useful for a ton of different


63
00:01:43,476 --> 00:01:44,926
designs, especially back in the


64
00:01:44,926 --> 00:01:46,126
iOS 6 days where things were


65
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:47,176
maybe a little bit simpler.


66
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,576
And it did this because it uses


67
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,306
a line-based layout system.


68
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:53,606
Now, we covered this last year


69
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:55,686
in a tour of UI CollectionView.


70
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:57,826
But in summary, a line-based


71
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,096
system allows you to lay out on


72
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:00,576
the orthogonal axis, of the


73
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,386
layout axis, until you just fill


74
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:03,496
up the amount of space you have


75
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:04,736
available and we drop the next


76
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:05,026
line.


77
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,726
And this is really great, it


78
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:09,116
works simple, easy to reason


79
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:09,446
about.


80
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:10,376
You can get it up and running


81
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:10,826
pretty quick.


82
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:15,736
But what about today's apps?


83
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,906
So as devices got more


84
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,656
heterogeneous and screen sizes


85
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:21,756
got different, things get mother


86
00:02:21,756 --> 00:02:23,326
complex in today's apps.


87
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,186
And here we see the App Store


88
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:26,866
that we're shipping in iOS 13.


89
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,236
Now, if your designer handed you


90
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,766
this design today, what would


91
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:31,116
you do?


92
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:32,216
Well, you'd think, "All right, I


93
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:33,346
got to choose how I'm going to


94
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:33,986
design this thing."


95
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:35,156
And there's a lot of options now


96
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:35,716
more than never.


97
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:38,106
And you might settle on


98
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:38,656
CollectionView.


99
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:40,426
And if you did that, you would


100
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:42,196
think to yourself, "Well, can I


101
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,406
really make flow happen here?"


102
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,396
And you'd probably discard that


103
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:45,666
right away.


104
00:02:47,196 --> 00:02:47,976
So at that point now you're


105
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,486
facing a custom layout.


106
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:51,256
And, you know, I see what you


107
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:52,526
guys say on Twitter about custom


108
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:52,876
layouts.


109
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:53,996
And they can be complicated.


110
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:55,676
So last year we talked about


111
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:57,616
this in a tour of


112
00:02:57,616 --> 00:02:58,136
CollectionView.


113
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:00,256
And we talked about what's


114
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:01,656
involved with building a custom


115
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:02,076
layout.


116
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:05,016
Now, there's a certain amount of


117
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:06,536
stuff you have to provide in


118
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:08,976
your concrete layout class, and


119
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:10,486
we walked through those things.


120
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:12,236
And we also walked through the


121
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:13,566
performance considerations you


122
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:14,776
had to think about when you're


123
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:15,976
designing a custom layout to


124
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,386
make sure it's fast if you have


125
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:18,466
a large number of items in your


126
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,046
CollectionView.


127
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,716
But we didn't cover everything,


128
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:22,286
and there's additional


129
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,356
challenges if you're building


130
00:03:23,356 --> 00:03:24,296
these custom layouts.


131
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:26,766
And there's a number of those,


132
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:27,876
but I'll cover a couple here,


133
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,286
you know, supplementaries and


134
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:31,246
decoration views -- two of the


135
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:33,416
view types that you can manage


136
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,816
in CollectionView -- are a


137
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:36,236
little tricky in custom layout.


138
00:03:36,236 --> 00:03:36,986
You're on your own.


139
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:39,296
And there's also self-sizing


140
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:40,326
challenges you have to wrestle


141
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:40,556
with.


142
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:42,156
And we'll get into that more


143
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:42,336
later.


144
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,186
So this year we're bringing a


145
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:46,796
brand-new concrete layout class


146
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:48,666
to the platforms that sits right


147
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,676
alongside flow as a peer.


148
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:53,406
And we call this compositional


149
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:53,886
layout.


150
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:55,706
Okay. So --


151
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:58,091
[ Applause ]


152
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,936
Haven't even seen it yet.


153
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,556
So -- so what is compositional


154
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:02,686
layout?


155
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:03,496
What does this thing do?


156
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:06,356
Well, just a little philosophy


157
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:06,856
right up front.


158
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,076
Hey, what is this built on?


159
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:09,656
It has three basic tent poles


160
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:10,606
that we built compositional


161
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:10,976
layout on.


162
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:12,466
First, it's composable -- the


163
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:13,816
idea of making complex things


164
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:14,696
from simple things.


165
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:16,555
And it's designed to be


166
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:17,086
flexible.


167
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:19,866
You can write any layout with


168
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:20,606
compositional layout.


169
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:21,776
It's extremely flexible.


170
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,496
And it's also fast by default.


171
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,296
So we've taken all of the


172
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:26,626
performance optimizations on


173
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:27,966
ourselves in the framework so


174
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:28,756
you don't have to think about


175
00:04:28,756 --> 00:04:28,836
it.


176
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,276
Compositional layout's all about


177
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:31,996
describing or defining what you


178
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:32,376
want to do.


179
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:33,766
It's a declarative kind of API.


180
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:37,376
All right, so composing --


181
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:38,076
you're going to hear this word a


182
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:39,016
lot in this conference.


183
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:40,776
So how do we do that with this


184
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:41,776
compositional layout idea?


185
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:43,186
Well, it's all about taking


186
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:44,636
small bits of layout, these


187
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:46,336
little components, and stitching


188
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:46,896
them all together.


189
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:48,556
So you're composing larger


190
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:49,796
layouts from smaller bits of


191
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:50,126
layout.


192
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:51,766
And we've learned from the great


193
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:52,916
lessons of flow layout where we


194
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,416
bring some of those line-based


195
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,526
lessons where you can lay out


196
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:56,836
along a line.


197
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:57,956
We may now how many items there


198
00:04:57,956 --> 00:04:58,506
are, we may not.


199
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,766
But we can lay out items on a


200
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,706
line in these little layout


201
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:01,126
groups.


202
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:03,506
And finally, as the name


203
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:05,656
implies, you don't subclass.


204
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:06,496
You literally just create a


205
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:08,096
thing and compose some elements


206
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:09,476
and then -- and then you're good


207
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:09,706
to go.


208
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:10,346
All right.


209
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:13,306
So that's a lot of talk for no


210
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:13,676
code.


211
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:14,686
And we're all about code at a


212
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:15,696
conference like this, right?


213
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:17,586
So let's go look at some code.


214
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:19,306
All right.


215
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:22,026
So this is a hello, world


216
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:23,156
compositional layout.


217
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,676
There's five lines of code.


218
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:27,036
Now, I'm going to switch over to


219
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,666
my device over here.


220
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:30,376
All right.


221
00:05:30,426 --> 00:05:33,446
So here we see our example app.


222
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:34,896
And I'm going to go to the list


223
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:35,536
example.


224
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:36,876
Wow, that's a boring layout.


225
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:37,756
Okay, so this looks like a


226
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:38,496
table, right?


227
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:39,706
Here we go.


228
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:41,436
Not much to that.


229
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:43,146
All right.


230
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:46,336
So let's focus strictly on the


231
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:47,236
code for a second.


232
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:47,976
Let's look at this.


233
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:49,246
All right.


234
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:50,846
So there's a couple observations


235
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:52,206
that will jump out right away.


236
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:53,426
And the first observation


237
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:54,986
because I know developers is,


238
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:55,896
like, "Hey, Steve, I can write


239
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:57,576
this in two lines of code with


240
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:57,956
flow.


241
00:05:57,996 --> 00:05:59,146
What is all this nonsense?"


242
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:01,476
And it's absolutely true, you


243
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:02,946
probably could do something like


244
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,156
that.


245
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:05,186
But what I want you to anchor in


246
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:05,996
your mind and think about


247
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:07,416
throughout the presentation is


248
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,996
that the amount of code as these


249
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:10,096
layouts get more and more


250
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:12,766
complex does not grow linear to


251
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,126
the problem size, it just kind


252
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:14,686
of tapers off.


253
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:15,286
Because we're just going to


254
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:16,806
compose in new things to the


255
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:18,436
layout in very simple,


256
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:20,526
easy-to-reason about ways to get


257
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:21,966
very complex layouts.


258
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:23,536
I'm super excited to show you


259
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:23,876
this stuff.


260
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,316
The second observation is I want


261
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:27,406
you to look at the -- there's a


262
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:28,606
natural progression here of


263
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:29,746
these types, right?


264
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:30,686
We got, like, you know, five


265
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:31,076
types here.


266
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:32,226
It's kind of -- what's up here?


267
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:34,926
And the types I want to focus on


268
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:36,666
first are these four types, and


269
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,216
they have this natural


270
00:06:38,216 --> 00:06:39,776
abstraction where they climb


271
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:40,306
this ladder.


272
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:42,596
And we start with an item which


273
00:06:42,596 --> 00:06:43,716
gets folded into a group.


274
00:06:43,716 --> 00:06:45,366
And the group goes into a


275
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:45,916
section.


276
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:48,156
And the section goes in our


277
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:48,606
layout.


278
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,326
Now, let's look at this


279
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:51,756
visually.


280
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:53,596
All right.


281
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:57,556
So here, this big rectangle is


282
00:06:57,556 --> 00:06:58,016
the layout.


283
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:01,256
And the layout is your entire


284
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:01,716
layout.


285
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:03,676
And now we have these blinding


286
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:05,206
white guys that represent our


287
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,456
sections, right?


288
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:08,256
And this maps directly onto the


289
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:09,966
data sources, you know, content


290
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:10,726
for those sections.


291
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:12,316
And then we're going to


292
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:14,126
represent a kind of a grid-style


293
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:15,026
traditional layout in this


294
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:15,766
particular example.


295
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,666
We see these groups which


296
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,026
represent our rows.


297
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:20,406
All right.


298
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:22,016
So inside that we have items.


299
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:24,086
So this is basically just


300
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:25,136
showing off this hierarchy we're


301
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:26,296
going to see all throughout the


302
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:27,706
talk, this repeating pattern of


303
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:31,106
item, group, section, layout.


304
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:34,256
Okay. So now I want to do a


305
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:35,296
little bit of talking about some


306
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:36,486
of the concepts, these core


307
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:38,526
types in compositional layout.


308
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:40,046
And once we get through all


309
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:41,006
this, we can jump over to the


310
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,486
demos to see how it all fits.


311
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:45,266
So I want to start with talking


312
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,316
about sizing.


313
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:48,306
So compositional layout has


314
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:49,906
extended sizing to make it


315
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:51,226
really easy to reason about how


316
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:52,876
you size things inside of a


317
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:53,866
compositional layout.


318
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,226
And everything has an explicit


319
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,766
size, has a strong opinion about


320
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:58,696
how big it is.


321
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:01,836
Now, we're in this Euclidian 2D


322
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:03,266
geometry plane, all right, with


323
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:03,856
flexion view.


324
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:05,916
And as such, a size really is


325
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:06,756
just two properties.


326
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:08,076
It's a width and a height


327
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:08,646
dimension.


328
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:11,756
And here we can see we've got a


329
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:12,866
stripped-down version of that


330
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:13,696
type definition.


331
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:15,226
And it has a width and a height


332
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:15,646
dimension.


333
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:16,686
But notice that the width and


334
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:17,396
the height dimensions, they're


335
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,366
not -- they're not scalar


336
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:18,676
values.


337
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:19,506
It's not just a float or


338
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:20,846
something, it's actually another


339
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:22,116
type, this


340
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,046
NSCollectionLayoutDimension.


341
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:25,506
All right.


342
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,156
So what's that?


343
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:27,756
It's really simple.


344
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:29,896
This is an axis-independent way


345
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:31,346
to describe how big a particular


346
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:31,966
axis is.


347
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:32,876
And we have four different


348
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:34,796
variations of how to define this


349
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:35,015
thing.


350
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:36,885
And let's walk through these in


351
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,586
a kind of a visual way.


352
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:41,395
So let's say you have an item


353
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,296
and you want to describe its


354
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:44,166
size relative to its container.


355
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:45,906
So the outer-most container will


356
00:08:45,906 --> 00:08:46,676
be your CollectionView.


357
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:48,376
Here we would just say, hey,


358
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:49,976
this item's widthDimension is


359
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:51,176
going to be a fractional width


360
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:52,696
or 50% of the width of its


361
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:53,246
container.


362
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:56,846
And similarly, we can say the


363
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:58,056
height of something is a


364
00:08:58,056 --> 00:08:59,566
fractional height of its


365
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:01,566
container, in this case 30%.


366
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:05,266
Now, because you can specify


367
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:07,656
things in this axis-independent


368
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:09,616
way, we can define something as


369
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,486
having a specific aspect ratio,


370
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:12,816
in this case an aspect ratio of


371
00:09:12,816 --> 00:09:15,516
1, by defining both the width


372
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,166
and the height as a dimension, a


373
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,506
fraction of the width of its


374
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:19,876
container.


375
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,186
And we say it's 25% as its


376
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,496
container, and the height


377
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:24,326
mirrors this.


378
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:26,656
Okay. So those are the


379
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,186
fractional variants creating a


380
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:28,716
dimension.


381
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:31,006
What about point-based values?


382
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:32,636
Well, we have two.


383
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:34,256
First one is the simplest,


384
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:34,876
absolute.


385
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:36,296
You know you need this thing to


386
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:37,246
be 200 points because your


387
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:39,576
designer's emphatic it's got to


388
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:40,256
be 200 points.


389
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:42,076
That's what it is, right?


390
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:42,796
Here we go, we've got an


391
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:44,336
interesting concept, estimated.


392
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,246
So if you don't know exactly how


393
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:48,166
big an item is going to be --


394
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,606
and we're going to talk about


395
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:50,916
this a lot -- you can estimate


396
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:51,056
it.


397
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:52,206
Say it's 200 points.


398
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:55,226
And then over time, it grows as


399
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:56,456
the item renders and we know a


400
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:57,566
little bit more about the


401
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:59,436
content in that item.


402
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:00,826
All right.


403
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:02,986
So that's layout dimension and


404
00:10:03,176 --> 00:10:03,996
size.


405
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,196
Next up let's talk a little bit


406
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:06,666
about item.


407
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,656
This is very simple.


408
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:08,746
This is a cell or it's a


409
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:09,406
supplementary.


410
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:10,676
It's a thing that renders on


411
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:11,116
screen.


412
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,506
And there's more stuff here


413
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:14,886
you'll see in the STK, but it's


414
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:16,866
a taste of that type definition.


415
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:18,516
We see that when we construct


416
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:20,256
one of these things, we give it


417
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:20,756
a size.


418
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,066
Everything's got an opinion


419
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:22,566
about size.


420
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,066
All right.


421
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:25,866
So we're going to continue up


422
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,146
that abstraction hierarchy.


423
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:28,176
We got item, and now we're in


424
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:28,536
group.


425
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:29,536
And what's a group?


426
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:30,726
A group is -- it's the


427
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:31,366
workhorse.


428
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,206
This is your basic unit of


429
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:34,156
layout that you're going to


430
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:34,756
compose together.


431
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:37,286
We have three forms: We have


432
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:38,506
horizontal, vertical.


433
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:39,976
You can think of these as, like,


434
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:41,226
little mini flow layouts, right?


435
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:42,696
They lay out on a line on the


436
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:44,116
horizontal axis and vertical


437
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:44,496
axis.


438
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:46,806
But then remember we talked


439
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:48,556
about before that it's flexible.


440
00:10:48,696 --> 00:10:50,426
Well, if you have something that


441
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:51,446
doesn't lay along a the line and


442
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:52,246
there's a lot of layouts that


443
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:52,826
don't do that.


444
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:54,316
We have a custom group.


445
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:56,166
So what is this?


446
00:10:57,286 --> 00:10:58,726
That allows you to specify the


447
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,876
absolute size and position of


448
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:02,446
items in a custom way.


449
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:03,436
So if you have something where


450
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:04,896
you have a pre-defined generator


451
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:05,906
that generates layouts, you can


452
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:06,726
use a custom group.


453
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:08,166
Or if you're doing a radial


454
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,096
layout and you want to compute


455
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:10,286
that, you can do it with a


456
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:10,926
custom group.


457
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:12,896
And what's cool is you can


458
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:14,066
compose custom groups right


459
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,276
alongside vertical and


460
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:15,786
horizontal.


461
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:17,596
So we build up the complex from


462
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:18,016
the simple.


463
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:20,086
All right.


464
00:11:20,086 --> 00:11:22,156
So that's group, the workhorse.


465
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:24,446
Next up we have


466
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,276
NSCollectionLayoutSection.


467
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,666
This is just as the name


468
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,806
implies, this is the layout


469
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:31,586
definition on a per-section


470
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:32,936
basis of the CollectionView,


471
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,196
maps directly onto the data


472
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:35,866
source notion of how many items


473
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:37,406
are in that section.


474
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,886
And we can see, as promised,


475
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,556
that when the initializer here


476
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:42,146
takes in allow group.


477
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:44,156
So we've gone from item, group,


478
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:45,106
section.


479
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,076
All right.


480
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:49,076
Our final stop on this traversal


481
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,686
of stuff, these are the two


482
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:53,486
top-level layout classes, right?


483
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:56,786
So for iOS and tvOS, we had UI


484
00:11:56,786 --> 00:11:57,436
CollectionView


485
00:11:57,436 --> 00:11:58,296
CompositionalLayout.


486
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:00,856
And on the Mac we have


487
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:02,646
NSViewCompositionalLayout.


488
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,026
Now, what's interesting here is


489
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:06,556
the definitions for all these


490
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:08,366
things are the same, regardless


491
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:08,896
of platform.


492
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:10,236
There's just some minor


493
00:12:10,236 --> 00:12:11,316
differences in the top-level


494
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:12,896
classes.


495
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:13,766
All right.


496
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,046
And the final thing to note


497
00:12:15,046 --> 00:12:15,866
here, and this is actually


498
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:16,546
really interesting, which we'll


499
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:17,296
see a little bit more in the


500
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,986
demos, is the way you construct


501
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:20,956
a compositional layout.


502
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:22,056
There's two ways.


503
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:24,486
And the simplest way is just


504
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:25,696
specify a layout section's


505
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:26,206
definition.


506
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,776
So this is very similar to what


507
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:29,296
we do with flow today, right?


508
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:30,696
Because flow weighs out every


509
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:31,526
section like every other


510
00:12:31,526 --> 00:12:31,926
section.


511
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:33,206
It's homogeneous in that way.


512
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:36,206
The compositional layout extends


513
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:36,946
this idea.


514
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:38,646
Because now we have this great


515
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:39,856
definition for what a section


516
00:12:39,856 --> 00:12:42,976
is, you can specify a closure


517
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:44,856
that will be called back and


518
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:46,586
will ask for those definitions


519
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:47,436
for the sections on a


520
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,876
per-section basis.


521
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,126
Now, this opens up a lot of


522
00:12:51,126 --> 00:12:52,306
possibilities because now your


523
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:53,846
layouts can be completely


524
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:55,876
distinct between sections.


525
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,886
And we have a lot to show you in


526
00:12:57,886 --> 00:12:59,276
the demos of this later on.


527
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:02,016
And hey, later on is right now.


528
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:03,926
So enough nattling on about


529
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:04,896
types, we're going to go see


530
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:05,626
this in action.


531
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:06,536
And to do that, I'm going to


532
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,346
bring up my colleague, Troy


533
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:08,896
Stephens.


534
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:09,116
Troy?


535
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:12,321
[ Applause ]


536
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:13,146
>> Troy Stephens: Thank you,


537
00:13:13,146 --> 00:13:13,266
Steve.


538
00:13:14,776 --> 00:13:16,046
As promised, we're going to look


539
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:16,676
at some code.


540
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:17,816
We're going to dig right into


541
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:19,716
the practical mechanics of how


542
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,416
you can build just about any


543
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:22,886
kind of layout you can dream up


544
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:24,366
from these simple elements that


545
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:25,406
Steve just described.


546
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:27,016
So make sure to download the


547
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:28,596
sample project for this talk if


548
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:29,496
you haven't already.


549
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:31,306
That way you can follow along,


550
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:33,156
study it at your leisure, and


551
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:35,506
most importantly, use our code


552
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:37,246
freely in your own projects.


553
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:38,736
Whatever kind of layout you


554
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:39,656
might be thinking about


555
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,236
implementing, there's likely to


556
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:42,356
be an example we're going to


557
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:43,746
look at today that is similar.


558
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:45,916
By taking our code as a basis


559
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:46,806
for yours, you're going to be


560
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:48,266
that much closer to your goal


561
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,056
that much more quickly.


562
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,706
We're going to see that it's


563
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,696
really easy to take any existing


564
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:54,226
compositional layout description


565
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:56,246
and incrementally refine it to


566
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:57,666
be exactly what you want.


567
00:13:59,026 --> 00:13:59,996
Now, as we walk through our


568
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:01,566
examples today, I want to you


569
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:03,726
notice the same basic pattern at


570
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:04,806
work in each of them.


571
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:06,306
This is the pattern that Steve


572
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:07,236
introduced us to.


573
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,466
Every single compositional


574
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:11,346
layout description is composed


575
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:13,846
of the same four basic parts:


576
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:15,896
Item, group, and section


577
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,596
descriptions wrapped in the


578
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:19,146
overall containing layout.


579
00:14:19,496 --> 00:14:20,936
So in each of the code examples


580
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:21,606
we're going to look at, we're


581
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:22,836
going to see that same


582
00:14:22,836 --> 00:14:24,346
four-layer nested structure.


583
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:26,036
And in the more advanced topics,


584
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:27,056
we're going to see how you can


585
00:14:27,056 --> 00:14:28,776
actually nest groups inside of


586
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:30,166
other groups in order to


587
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:32,476
construct or compose more


588
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,306
complex, sophisticated layouts


589
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:35,956
out of simple, easy to


590
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:37,026
understand parts.


591
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,686
So let's get to the code.


592
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,286
And here we have -- we're going


593
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,876
to start with our list example,


594
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:49,266
which is the one that Steve


595
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:49,646
showed us.


596
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:51,426
So here's -- this is about the


597
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:53,696
simplest kind of useful layout


598
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:54,396
we can imagine.


599
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:56,456
It's a single-column list where


600
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:58,226
the items span the width of our


601
00:14:58,226 --> 00:14:58,956
CollectionView.


602
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:02,316
And if I rotate the phone, we


603
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:03,646
can see that indeed the items


604
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:05,206
expand to fill the available


605
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:06,836
width while maintaining the same


606
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:07,966
constant height.


607
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:09,656
So how do we implement this


608
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:11,016
using compositional layout?


609
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:12,956
I've got our list view


610
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:14,946
controller source file open


611
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:15,836
here, which is the one where


612
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:16,656
there is implemented.


613
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:17,856
And in each of our examples


614
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:19,476
today, we've just gone ahead and


615
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:20,986
declared a create layout


616
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,346
function that neatly


617
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:23,936
encapsulates our description of


618
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,686
our compositional layout that we


619
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:27,456
then return back out to be


620
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:28,676
hooked up to our CollectionView


621
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:29,626
just like any other


622
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:30,906
CollectionView layout would be.


623
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:33,056
So first thing to notice here,


624
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:35,606
we start, as I promised, by


625
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:37,146
describing an item and itself


626
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:37,656
size.


627
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:39,906
We take that item description


628
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:42,036
and we use it to describe a


629
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:44,626
group of items.


630
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:46,316
Next, we wrap that group in a


631
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:46,906
section.


632
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:49,196
And finally, we create and


633
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:51,106
return our compositional layout.


634
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:53,016
So there's that item, group,


635
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:54,256
section layout structure.


636
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:55,406
The other thing I want you to


637
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:56,676
pay attention to here and we


638
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:57,746
should really understand before


639
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,056
we move on to the other examples


640
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:01,056
is the way that the items are


641
00:16:01,056 --> 00:16:01,996
given their size.


642
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:04,336
In this case it is the group


643
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:06,666
size that ultimately ends up


644
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:08,466
determining the item size.


645
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,446
And I'm going to explain how


646
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:10,066
that works.


647
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:12,296
So groups might seem a little


648
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:13,846
superfluous in this simple list


649
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:14,396
example.


650
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:15,896
A group in a compositional


651
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:17,766
layout typically represents some


652
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:19,076
repeating structure that you're


653
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,686
going to have, a column of items


654
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:21,926
or a row of items.


655
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:23,656
In this case it's a row, but we


656
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:24,726
really have kind of a trivial


657
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:26,236
case where we only have one item


658
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:26,716
per row.


659
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,296
So each item is going to get its


660
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:29,896
own group.


661
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:31,576
But groups are always there as a


662
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:32,906
consistent part of the


663
00:16:32,906 --> 00:16:33,706
compositional layout


664
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:34,626
description, and we're going to


665
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,256
use them to our benefit to help


666
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:37,326
define the item sizes.


667
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,076
So Steve explained all about


668
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:41,466
container-relevant sizing.


669
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:43,926
Let's look first at our group


670
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:44,866
size description.


671
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:48,206
We've asked here for our group,


672
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:49,836
which is our row in this case,


673
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,326
to span 100% the width of its


674
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:52,946
container.


675
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:54,726
The group's container is its


676
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:56,406
section, which in turn spans the


677
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:57,656
layout or the CollectionView.


678
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,036
Meanwhile, we've asked for each


679
00:17:01,116 --> 00:17:03,116
group's height to be an absolute


680
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:05,215
value of 44 points tall.


681
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:07,185
Now, notice that this has


682
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:09,076
basically already defined what


683
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:10,376
our item box should be -- that's


684
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:11,656
how we want our item sized, the


685
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,626
width of the CollectionView and


686
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:13,646
44 points high.


687
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:15,326
So all we need to do up here


688
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,346
where we specify our item size


689
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:18,986
is to say that we'd like each


690
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:21,396
item to be 100% the width and


691
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:22,756
100% the height of its


692
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:24,816
container, the item's container


693
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:25,896
being the group.


694
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:28,056
So that's all it takes to


695
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:29,076
implement a list.


696
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:30,166
But the interesting thing as we


697
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,186
go along, we're going to see


698
00:17:31,186 --> 00:17:32,316
that we don't have to make a lot


699
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:33,436
of code changes to get some


700
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:34,536
pretty dramatically different


701
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:35,106
layouts.


702
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:37,006
Let's take a look at another


703
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:40,016
example, that being I'm going to


704
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:40,976
open up our grid here.


705
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:43,196
And this is a five-column grid


706
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,566
of edge to edge items.


707
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:47,646
And we can see if I rotate the


708
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:51,046
phone, that this layout is


709
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:52,466
indeed described in such a way


710
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:53,886
that we always get five columns


711
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:54,376
across.


712
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:56,496
The items always remain square,


713
00:17:56,496 --> 00:17:58,136
and they're always sized such


714
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:00,136
that we get exactly five columns


715
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:00,506
wide.


716
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:04,626
Now, this is an example where


717
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,376
groups actually come in a bit


718
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,646
more handy and it will be easier


719
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:08,776
to understand what their


720
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:09,496
function is.


721
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:11,576
So opening up the grid view


722
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:12,706
controller source file, looking


723
00:18:12,706 --> 00:18:13,806
at our same create layout


724
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:16,056
function, again, we have that


725
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:20,116
item, group, section layout


726
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:20,676
structure.


727
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:22,826
Basically looks like our list


728
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:23,456
layout description.


729
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:24,516
The only thing that's different


730
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:26,466
here is the item and group sizes


731
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:27,376
that we specified.


732
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,416
So let's look at how those


733
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:28,716
differ.


734
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:31,876
We still want each group --


735
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:33,216
since a group represents a row


736
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:34,936
-- to span the entire width of


737
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:35,786
the CollectionView.


738
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:36,536
That's great.


739
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:38,976
But now we don't want our items


740
00:18:38,976 --> 00:18:40,406
to be the same width of their


741
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,546
group; we want to have five


742
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:42,306
items across.


743
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:43,406
And the way that we achieve that


744
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,566
in this example is up here we


745
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:48,396
specify the item's width to be


746
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:50,146
20% of the width of itself


747
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:50,636
container.


748
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:52,216
The item's container is its


749
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:53,916
group or row, so we're going to


750
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,146
have -- we're going to be able


751
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:57,076
to fit exactly five items across


752
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:58,246
because of this width that we've


753
00:18:58,246 --> 00:18:58,946
specified.


754
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,226
Now, as for the heights, instead


755
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:02,626
of an absolute point value,


756
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:04,826
we've declared that we want the


757
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:07,236
height of each group or row to


758
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:10,096
be 20% of the width of the


759
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:11,076
group's containers.


760
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:12,236
And notice we're using this


761
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:15,096
ability to specify fractional


762
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:17,026
widths or heights across axes


763
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:17,146
here.


764
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:18,756
And this is really handy because


765
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:20,116
it's how we make our items


766
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:20,706
square.


767
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,286
The item width and the group


768
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,186
height are the same.


769
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:27,506
And since the group's height


770
00:19:27,506 --> 00:19:28,756
sets the item's height, all we


771
00:19:28,756 --> 00:19:30,096
need to do is set our item


772
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:32,446
height to be 100% of the group's


773
00:19:32,446 --> 00:19:32,616
height.


774
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:35,886
So that's it, that's pretty


775
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:37,306
simple for creating a grid.


776
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:38,566
And we did so without really


777
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:39,856
fundamentally different code


778
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:41,456
than we used for implementing a


779
00:19:41,456 --> 00:19:41,856
list.


780
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:43,726
Now, often if you get a layout


781
00:19:43,726 --> 00:19:44,626
from your designers, usually


782
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:45,786
you'll want to have some space


783
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:46,446
between items.


784
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:47,766
So let's look at how to add that


785
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:48,046
next.


786
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:50,466
Bringing up the inset items grid


787
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:52,136
example, we still have a


788
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:54,086
five-column grid, but we just


789
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:55,866
have some space now around and


790
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:57,056
between the items.


791
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,206
Let's open up our inset items


792
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:01,576
view,


793
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:04,006
InsetItemsGridViewController to


794
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:05,726
take a look at that.


795
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,146
And here we have, if you compare


796
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:09,296
this with the previous example,


797
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:10,786
you'll see that there's only one


798
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,516
line of code different here.


799
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,006
And this is a useful observation


800
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,016
because you can really think


801
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:17,966
about this layout as being


802
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,886
computed almost exactly like the


803
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,616
previous edge-to-edge layout.


804
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:25,016
Each item is allocated the same


805
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,476
box that it was given before,


806
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,256
the same edge-to-edge squares.


807
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:30,046
But in this case we've decided


808
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:32,406
that instead of sizing our items


809
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:33,576
to take up the full square


810
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:34,886
they're allocated, as a last


811
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:37,156
step we're going to inset the


812
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:39,466
item's content by five points on


813
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:40,096
each side.


814
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:41,706
So item content insets work


815
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:42,686
usefully in this way.


816
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:45,136
Sort of a last-stage subtraction


817
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:46,376
from the layout that was already


818
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:46,896
computed.


819
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:48,066
So that's really cool.


820
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:49,636
We've seen how to do lists and


821
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:50,196
grids.


822
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:51,896
And we've achieved our grids


823
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:54,726
using relative item sizing.


824
00:20:55,096 --> 00:20:55,896
But there's another really


825
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:58,306
powerful way to be able to


826
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,086
grid-like layouts with rows and


827
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:00,596
columns.


828
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,806
And I want to show you that so


829
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:03,746
we can be familiar with it.


830
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:05,126
So I'm going to pull up our


831
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:06,636
two-column grid example here.


832
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,956
And superficially this looks


833
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:11,016
pretty much just like the


834
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:12,216
five-column grid, we just have


835
00:21:12,256 --> 00:21:13,366
fewer columns, right?


836
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:15,446
And indeed, if I rotate the


837
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:17,056
device, it adapts: It's always


838
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:18,936
two columns and the items expand


839
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:20,606
to be the appropriate width.


840
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:22,886
But this is implemented a bit


841
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:24,426
differently and it's instructive


842
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:25,376
to take a look at how.


843
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:27,016
So in our


844
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:28,876
TwoColumnViewController here,


845
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,506
we're going to look at our


846
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:31,556
createLayout function.


847
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,546
And so the interesting things to


848
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:36,146
notice here, again, we have that


849
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:38,556
item, group, section layout


850
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:39,096
structure.


851
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:39,946
But the first thing to pay


852
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:42,006
attention to that might not be


853
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:43,776
immediately obvious is that we


854
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:45,406
are constructing our horizontal


855
00:21:45,406 --> 00:21:47,246
group that represents each row


856
00:21:47,246 --> 00:21:48,436
in a slightly different way.


857
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:50,516
We're using a different form of


858
00:21:50,516 --> 00:21:52,276
the initializer that takes an


859
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:53,926
explicit count parameter.


860
00:21:54,236 --> 00:21:56,066
Here we're explicitly specifying


861
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,676
that we want to have exactly two


862
00:21:58,676 --> 00:22:00,596
items per group, two items per


863
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:01,236
row.


864
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:02,466
Now, this will cause


865
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:03,576
compositional layout to


866
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,356
automatically figure out what


867
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:06,546
the item width has to be in


868
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:07,446
order to make that happen.


869
00:22:08,406 --> 00:22:10,226
We do specify an item width here


870
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:11,396
because we always have to.


871
00:22:11,616 --> 00:22:13,506
We say 100% of the container.


872
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:15,366
But that value at the top ends


873
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:16,376
up effectively getting


874
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,006
overridden.


875
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:18,106
When you ask for a certain


876
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:19,586
number of items per group,


877
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:21,336
compositional layout -- that


878
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:22,616
compositional layout is going to


879
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:24,026
take that as kind of an override


880
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:25,136
and it's going to compute


881
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,246
whatever width is actually


882
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:27,686
necessary to fulfill our


883
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:28,316
request.


884
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:29,936
We're also using a different way


885
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:31,216
of putting space around and


886
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,286
between the items.


887
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:33,446
Compositional layout offers a


888
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:34,906
variety of ways to do this,


889
00:22:34,906 --> 00:22:36,156
which makes it a really flexible


890
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:36,486
API.


891
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:39,666
Instead of specifying itemInsets


892
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,216
in this case, we're specifying


893
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:44,446
contentInsets on the section.


894
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,306
So here we want to have a little


895
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:47,456
margin on the left and right


896
00:22:47,456 --> 00:22:47,616
side.


897
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,956
And we only have one section, so


898
00:22:48,956 --> 00:22:50,196
this basically applies to our


899
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:50,856
whole layout.


900
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,236
So we're asking for 10 points of


901
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:54,826
leading and 10 points of


902
00:22:54,826 --> 00:22:55,776
trailing space.


903
00:22:56,846 --> 00:22:58,266
Notice while we're on this line


904
00:22:58,266 --> 00:22:59,806
of code that compositional


905
00:22:59,806 --> 00:23:00,836
layout is structured to


906
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:02,626
encourage you to express your


907
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:04,166
layouts in layout


908
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:05,556
direction-agnostic ways.


909
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:07,776
So instead of left and right


910
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,526
explicitly, we're specifying


911
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:10,676
leading and trailing.


912
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,316
And this is fantastic because


913
00:23:12,316 --> 00:23:13,726
when you run your app in a right


914
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,156
to left language, you're going


915
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:17,146
to automatically get the right


916
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,206
layout adaptation.


917
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:23,106
Here we're also using a property


918
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:24,646
called interItemSpacing on the


919
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:24,896
group.


920
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:26,416
So we can ask for a group to put


921
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:27,666
a certain amount of space


922
00:23:27,696 --> 00:23:29,256
between its items, in this case


923
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:31,516
fixed spacing of 10 points.


924
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:32,326
And that's it.


925
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:34,246
Everything else is very similar


926
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,506
to the previous examples.


927
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:36,776
We're just using that ability to


928
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:38,456
explicitly specify the number of


929
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:39,206
items per group.


930
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:41,586
So that's all pretty neat.


931
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:43,606
But Steve mentioned another


932
00:23:43,696 --> 00:23:44,916
really cool capability that I


933
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:45,876
want to dive into.


934
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,326
He mentioned that it's possible


935
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,886
to have a different layout for


936
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,476
each section.


937
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:51,816
So far we've only looked at one


938
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:53,586
section layout so far, but what


939
00:23:53,586 --> 00:23:54,546
if we want to have multiple


940
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:56,456
sections, yet have them able to


941
00:23:56,456 --> 00:23:57,496
each have their own distinct


942
00:23:57,496 --> 00:23:57,856
layout?


943
00:23:58,746 --> 00:23:59,926
So let's open up our distinct


944
00:23:59,926 --> 00:24:00,866
sections example.


945
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,616
And here we have a layout that's


946
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:04,876
sort of a composite of some


947
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:05,686
others that we've done.


948
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:07,136
So we have three sections in


949
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:07,726
this layout.


950
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:11,446
The first section is a simple,


951
00:24:11,446 --> 00:24:12,886
single-column list like we had


952
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:13,326
before.


953
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:16,006
The second is a five-column grid


954
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:16,806
of square items.


955
00:24:16,806 --> 00:24:18,876
And the third is a three-column


956
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,266
grid of rectangular items.


957
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:22,976
So how do we implement this?


958
00:24:24,346 --> 00:24:25,076
Let's open up our


959
00:24:25,076 --> 00:24:26,616
DistinctSectionsViewController


960
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:28,166
and look at our createLayout


961
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:28,586
function.


962
00:24:30,126 --> 00:24:31,456
Now, at first glance this looks


963
00:24:31,456 --> 00:24:32,406
somewhat significantly


964
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:33,946
different, but it's really just


965
00:24:33,946 --> 00:24:35,206
that the outermost component of


966
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:36,386
it where we instantiate the


967
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:37,486
layout, instead of coming at the


968
00:24:37,486 --> 00:24:38,196
end, it's coming at the


969
00:24:38,196 --> 00:24:38,666
beginning.


970
00:24:39,306 --> 00:24:40,166
And here's the reason why.


971
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:42,336
So we're instantiating the


972
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:43,596
compositional layout using an


973
00:24:43,596 --> 00:24:45,356
initializer that takes that


974
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:47,066
section provider closure as its


975
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:48,526
parameter that Steve mentioned.


976
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:50,656
So section provider closure, I


977
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,956
mean, this is an arbitrary block


978
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:52,406
of code.


979
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:54,596
So as you can imagine, you can


980
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:56,756
respond to this being invoked by


981
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:58,396
returning whatever kind of


982
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,856
layout you want for that


983
00:24:59,856 --> 00:25:00,296
section.


984
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:02,516
Your past two parameters,


985
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:04,376
section index that tells you


986
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:05,186
which section -- it's going to


987
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:06,606
be zero, 1 or 2 in our case.


988
00:25:07,596 --> 00:25:08,976
And a layout environment that


989
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:10,106
contains various useful


990
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,326
properties you can refer to.


991
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:12,666
We're going to look at that in a


992
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:13,076
moment.


993
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:16,676
So -- but everything else inside


994
00:25:16,676 --> 00:25:17,796
this closure is just the same


995
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:18,956
code that we wrote before.


996
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:20,916
We're specifying an item


997
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:21,446
description.


998
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:23,986
We're wrapping that in a group


999
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:24,576
description.


1000
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,026
And then lastly, we specify a


1001
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,256
section description, and that's


1002
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:29,166
what we returned from the


1003
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,386
section provider closure.


1004
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,966
Now, compositional layout knows


1005
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:34,156
to automatically invoke this


1006
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:35,866
closure whenever it needs to


1007
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:38,666
requery for a new description of


1008
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:39,676
a particular section.


1009
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:42,126
So the contents are pretty much


1010
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:43,266
very similar to before.


1011
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,466
The interesting thing that


1012
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:46,516
differentiates our various


1013
00:25:46,516 --> 00:25:47,886
layouts is mainly that we have a


1014
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:48,826
different number of columns,


1015
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:49,116
right?


1016
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:50,746
So we've declared this


1017
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:52,966
SectionLayoutKind type, it's


1018
00:25:52,966 --> 00:25:53,826
declared at the top of the


1019
00:25:53,826 --> 00:25:54,376
source file.


1020
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:55,416
Let's take a look at.


1021
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:56,846
When we initialize it, we pass


1022
00:25:56,886 --> 00:25:58,506
in the section index that's


1023
00:25:58,506 --> 00:25:59,816
going to be zero, 1, or 2.


1024
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,666
And all it does is map that to


1025
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,476
an enum type that tells us the


1026
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:05,606
SectionLayoutKind is going to be


1027
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,306
either a list, or grid5, or


1028
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:08,906
grid3.


1029
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:11,696
And we've also added this handy


1030
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,436
gettable property, columnCount,


1031
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:14,636
where we can just ask that


1032
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:16,636
SectionLayoutKind value how many


1033
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:17,816
columns we should have in that


1034
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:18,136
layout.


1035
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:21,056
Going back to our createLayout


1036
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,376
function we can see where we ask


1037
00:26:22,376 --> 00:26:24,356
for that columnCount, and we use


1038
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:25,556
it in two different places.


1039
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:29,436
As in our two-column grid


1040
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:31,256
example, we're explicitly


1041
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,796
passing the number of columns


1042
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:34,836
that we want when we instantiate


1043
00:26:34,836 --> 00:26:35,826
our horizontal group.


1044
00:26:36,616 --> 00:26:38,026
So we're leaving it to


1045
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:38,866
compositional layout to


1046
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:40,506
automatically figure out what


1047
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:42,006
sort of item width that implies.


1048
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:43,676
We're also using the number of


1049
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:45,716
columns here to determine the


1050
00:26:45,716 --> 00:26:46,936
group height or the row height


1051
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:48,006
for the layout since we want to


1052
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:48,416
vary it.


1053
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,126
So you can do this any way that


1054
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:50,516
you want.


1055
00:26:50,806 --> 00:26:52,816
So that's pretty neat.


1056
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:53,856
But what if we want to be able


1057
00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:55,166
to have this layout adapt,


1058
00:26:55,736 --> 00:26:56,066
right?


1059
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:58,596
What if we rotate the phone and


1060
00:26:59,306 --> 00:27:00,726
maybe this isn't making the best


1061
00:27:00,726 --> 00:27:01,776
use of space?


1062
00:27:02,526 --> 00:27:03,906
Maybe we could fit more items.


1063
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:05,976
So let's look at our adaptive


1064
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:06,836
sections layout.


1065
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:09,276
Now, at first glance this looks


1066
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:10,426
exactly like the previous


1067
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:10,926
example.


1068
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:13,896
But when we rotate this one, we


1069
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:15,216
can see that our first section


1070
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,846
adapts to show two columns


1071
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,806
across; our second shows ten


1072
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:21,186
across; and our third shows six


1073
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:21,766
across.


1074
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:23,766
So how do we implement this in


1075
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:24,176
code?


1076
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:25,946
It's actually quite similar to


1077
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:26,976
our previous example.


1078
00:27:28,586 --> 00:27:29,196
Opening up our


1079
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,096
AdaptiveSectionsViewController


1080
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:33,076
and looking at the createLayout


1081
00:27:33,076 --> 00:27:35,636
function, this is very similar


1082
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:36,676
to the previous example.


1083
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:37,576
The first thing that we'll


1084
00:27:37,576 --> 00:27:39,366
notice is different that we've


1085
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,016
changed our SectionLayoutKind


1086
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:41,376
type.


1087
00:27:42,026 --> 00:27:42,696
So we still have the


1088
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:43,866
SectionLayoutKind.


1089
00:27:44,286 --> 00:27:45,786
But columnCount is no longer


1090
00:27:45,786 --> 00:27:47,326
just a gettable property, it's a


1091
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:48,796
function that takes a parameter.


1092
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:52,396
And we're passing it a width


1093
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:54,406
that we're getting from that


1094
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,286
layoutEnvironment.


1095
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:56,746
So that layoutEnvironment type


1096
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,366
contains information such as the


1097
00:27:58,406 --> 00:27:59,806
overall container width that


1098
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:01,386
your layout has to work with,


1099
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:04,046
and on iOS it also has trait


1100
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:05,666
collections info inside it.


1101
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:07,076
So you can use all of that


1102
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,906
information to figure out what


1103
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:10,116
kind of layout is appropriate


1104
00:28:10,116 --> 00:28:11,336
for the current environment.


1105
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:13,276
Here we're just using the width.


1106
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:16,476
And if we look at the top where


1107
00:28:16,476 --> 00:28:18,026
we declared SectionLayoutKind,


1108
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:19,946
we can see that columnCount


1109
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:21,416
function that's now a function,


1110
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:23,296
and it takes a width parameter


1111
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:24,096
that we passed in.


1112
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:25,106
That's the width of our


1113
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:26,266
CollectionView basically in this


1114
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:26,616
case.


1115
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:28,236
And we've basically implemented


1116
00:28:28,236 --> 00:28:28,926
a layout break.


1117
00:28:29,326 --> 00:28:30,906
We decided that if we have more


1118
00:28:30,906 --> 00:28:32,696
than 800 points of width to work


1119
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:34,106
with on our device, we're going


1120
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:35,376
to go into what we call


1121
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:36,126
wideMode.


1122
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:38,896
And in wideMode we simply return


1123
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:40,336
a larger number of columns for


1124
00:28:40,336 --> 00:28:40,946
each section.


1125
00:28:41,646 --> 00:28:43,266
And that's it.


1126
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:44,566
If we go back to our create


1127
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:45,766
layout function, we can see that


1128
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,336
after we've got that number of


1129
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:49,646
columns, we pretty much use it


1130
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,416
in very much the same way as


1131
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:51,936
before.


1132
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:53,506
So it's very little code change


1133
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:55,266
to get all the way to having an


1134
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,426
adaptive rotating layout.


1135
00:28:57,956 --> 00:29:00,396
So this is all very neat.


1136
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,006
But so far we've only really


1137
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,306
talked about items.


1138
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:05,136
We haven't even delved into what


1139
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:07,516
you can do with supplementary


1140
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:08,836
views and decoration views.


1141
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:09,916
And one of the really cool


1142
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:10,866
things I love about


1143
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:12,776
compositional layout is that it


1144
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:14,926
makes it easier than ever to be


1145
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:17,046
able to go beyond just headers


1146
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,136
and footers and work with


1147
00:29:18,246 --> 00:29:20,336
arbitrary supplementary views of


1148
00:29:20,336 --> 00:29:21,276
your own design.


1149
00:29:21,856 --> 00:29:24,336
So to tell us a bit more about


1150
00:29:24,336 --> 00:29:25,646
that and to take us into some of


1151
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:26,976
the more advanced topics about


1152
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:28,556
other cool stuff you can do with


1153
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:29,896
compositional layout, I'd like


1154
00:29:29,896 --> 00:29:30,986
to invite my colleague Steve


1155
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:31,866
back on stage.


1156
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:32,496
Thank you.


1157
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:37,876
[ Applause ]


1158
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,336
>> Steve Breen: So now that


1159
00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:40,856
we've seen how the basics work,


1160
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:41,896
how you get up and running with


1161
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:42,806
compositional layout, I'm going


1162
00:29:42,806 --> 00:29:44,736
to walk through how we deal with


1163
00:29:44,856 --> 00:29:46,106
more advanced topics.


1164
00:29:46,106 --> 00:29:47,326
Because there's a ton of


1165
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:48,936
different ways you can do custom


1166
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:49,836
layouts with compositional


1167
00:29:49,836 --> 00:29:50,046
layout.


1168
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:51,396
All right.


1169
00:29:51,396 --> 00:29:53,926
So first I want to talk a bit


1170
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,476
about supplementary items.


1171
00:29:56,616 --> 00:29:58,126
So CollectionView manages three


1172
00:29:58,126 --> 00:30:00,086
basic view class types: Your


1173
00:30:00,086 --> 00:30:01,486
cells, the things you interact


1174
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:02,906
with to express your model


1175
00:30:02,906 --> 00:30:04,966
objects; it also represents


1176
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,796
supplementary items and


1177
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:07,736
decoration items.


1178
00:30:08,446 --> 00:30:10,236
Now, these are meant to adorn


1179
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:11,296
other parts of your layout to


1180
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:12,786
give you visual cues about


1181
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:14,436
content information, like maybe


1182
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:16,106
a badge on a cell that says,


1183
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,076
"Hey, you got a comment on your


1184
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:17,816
tweet," or whatever.


1185
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:20,906
And we see common uses for these


1186
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:22,886
today with these three examples


1187
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:24,256
-- badges, and headers, and


1188
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,776
footers.


1189
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:26,766
And we have support and flow


1190
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:27,666
[inaudible] today with sticky


1191
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:28,406
headers and footers.


1192
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:29,406
And they float above that


1193
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:29,876
content.


1194
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:32,086
But we extend this in


1195
00:30:32,086 --> 00:30:32,946
compositional layout, making


1196
00:30:32,946 --> 00:30:34,166
this a whole lot easier.


1197
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:36,776
And we can simplify this with


1198
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:37,836
this notion of being able to


1199
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,026
anchor content onto an item or


1200
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:42,036
group in your layout.


1201
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:43,276
It simplifies that visual


1202
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:44,446
relationship, how that might


1203
00:30:44,446 --> 00:30:44,536
work.


1204
00:30:44,536 --> 00:30:47,006
All right, let's look at this


1205
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:47,496
visually.


1206
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:50,406
So here we can see we've got


1207
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:51,416
this new type,


1208
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:52,876
NSCollectionLayoutAnchor.


1209
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:54,986
And here we specify the


1210
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,536
relationship between these two


1211
00:30:56,536 --> 00:30:56,896
types.


1212
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,066
So our supplementary is going to


1213
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,216
be anchored relative to the


1214
00:31:00,216 --> 00:31:02,016
geometry of a host space, an


1215
00:31:02,016 --> 00:31:03,836
item or group in these kinds of


1216
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:04,326
ways.


1217
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:06,646
And it's super easy to reason


1218
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:06,956
about.


1219
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:11,766
Okay. So here we see we have


1220
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,726
NSCollectionLayoutAnchor we


1221
00:31:13,726 --> 00:31:14,276
create right away.


1222
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:15,376
And we specify the edges.


1223
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:16,716
We want this item to be pinned


1224
00:31:16,716 --> 00:31:19,146
to the top trailing side of that


1225
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:20,156
particular cell.


1226
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:22,656
And we want it to poke outside


1227
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:24,106
of that geometry a little bit.


1228
00:31:24,106 --> 00:31:25,056
And we see that with fractional


1229
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:25,276
height.


1230
00:31:27,106 --> 00:31:28,836
Okay. So here we can see the


1231
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:29,416
device.


1232
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:30,666
So we've got these badges on


1233
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:31,066
there, right?


1234
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:33,096
With my wonderful design skills.


1235
00:31:33,096 --> 00:31:34,396
We've got a four-item grid with


1236
00:31:34,846 --> 00:31:36,176
those wonderful corn flower blue


1237
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:36,696
cells.


1238
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:38,476
And we see here that some of


1239
00:31:38,476 --> 00:31:39,436
these items have these little


1240
00:31:39,436 --> 00:31:40,246
notifiers on them, right,


1241
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:41,146
letting them know, "Hey, you got


1242
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:42,196
something to pay attention to


1243
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:42,396
here."


1244
00:31:43,576 --> 00:31:45,626
And with this, they kind of poke


1245
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:47,126
outside that geometry a little


1246
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:47,456
bit, right?


1247
00:31:47,676 --> 00:31:48,486
They're not really inside the


1248
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:49,676
geometry of the cell itself.


1249
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:51,486
Let's go back to the slides real


1250
00:31:51,486 --> 00:31:52,686
quick and walk through this.


1251
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:54,596
All right.


1252
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:56,156
So that fractionalOffset is what


1253
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:57,636
buys us the ability to poke


1254
00:31:57,636 --> 00:31:58,306
outside a little bit.


1255
00:31:58,306 --> 00:31:59,096
We're going to move over


1256
00:31:59,096 --> 00:32:01,406
fractionally 30% in the positive


1257
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:04,016
X and then up in the minus Y 30%


1258
00:32:04,016 --> 00:32:04,436
as well.


1259
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:06,646
And then we see we defined the


1260
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:07,956
CollectionLayout


1261
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:09,566
SupplementaryItem with a


1262
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:11,156
badgeSize and elementKind.


1263
00:32:11,156 --> 00:32:12,046
So we're going to refer back to


1264
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:12,766
the view class for


1265
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:13,606
CollectionView with that


1266
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:14,846
registered supplementary type.


1267
00:32:15,486 --> 00:32:17,426
And then we specify the


1268
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:18,976
container's anchor, specifying


1269
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:19,796
how it's going to relate.


1270
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:21,456
So now that we have this


1271
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:22,856
definition of our supplementary,


1272
00:32:22,856 --> 00:32:24,026
we need to associate it with


1273
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:24,516
something.


1274
00:32:24,786 --> 00:32:26,086
And that needs to be associated


1275
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,476
with an item, a cell.


1276
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:30,226
So in this case we're going to


1277
00:32:30,226 --> 00:32:31,686
initialize it with an extended


1278
00:32:31,686 --> 00:32:33,346
variant of initializer that


1279
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:34,456
takes an array of


1280
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:35,566
supplementaries.


1281
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:35,976
And that's it.


1282
00:32:39,286 --> 00:32:39,476
All right.


1283
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:40,536
So what about headers and


1284
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:41,146
footers?


1285
00:32:41,486 --> 00:32:43,166
So headers and footers are just


1286
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:44,696
a tad bit different than


1287
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,886
supplementaries for these items.


1288
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:47,326
When you think about the content


1289
00:32:47,326 --> 00:32:48,776
that you want to adorn with a


1290
00:32:48,776 --> 00:32:50,566
supplementary header and footer,


1291
00:32:51,276 --> 00:32:52,226
you really don't want that


1292
00:32:52,226 --> 00:32:53,106
supplementary heard and footer


1293
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:54,726
to occlude the content; you want


1294
00:32:54,726 --> 00:32:56,596
to extend that content area so


1295
00:32:56,596 --> 00:32:58,096
you can see the content itself.


1296
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,466
So in this instance we have a


1297
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:01,666
different variation of


1298
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:02,926
supplementary called boundary


1299
00:33:02,926 --> 00:33:03,886
supplementaries.


1300
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:04,936
We're going to bin it to the


1301
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:06,346
boundaries of that supplementary


1302
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:07,426
-- of that host geometry.


1303
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:09,706
Now, we can do these boundary


1304
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:11,136
supplementary items for sections


1305
00:33:11,136 --> 00:33:13,316
or the entire layout, and we can


1306
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:14,716
pin them to this whole balance,


1307
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:16,056
which do some pretty cool stuff.


1308
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:17,226
All right.


1309
00:33:17,226 --> 00:33:18,196
So I'm going to switch back over


1310
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,226
to the device here hopefully.


1311
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:21,856
There we go.


1312
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:22,366
All right.


1313
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:24,586
Let's see what this looks like.


1314
00:33:25,146 --> 00:33:26,836
So pretty straightforward


1315
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:27,206
example.


1316
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,146
Here we have a pinned section


1317
00:33:29,146 --> 00:33:30,136
headers and footers.


1318
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:31,676
And we scroll and everything


1319
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,926
looks just like we expect.


1320
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:34,786
Look at the code.


1321
00:33:36,156 --> 00:33:37,556
All right.


1322
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:38,416
So here's what we got.


1323
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,296
So it's similar to what we say


1324
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:41,096
just a minute ago with the


1325
00:33:41,096 --> 00:33:42,326
BoundarySupplementaryItems,


1326
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:44,016
except now rather than that


1327
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:45,636
container anchor, we see we have


1328
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:46,726
alignment property.


1329
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:49,896
And here we specify top for the


1330
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:50,896
header and bottom for the


1331
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:51,116
footer.


1332
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:52,316
We want to go to the top and the


1333
00:33:52,316 --> 00:33:53,296
bottom of that section of


1334
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:53,786
geometry.


1335
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:55,806
And to make sure that header


1336
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:57,566
kind of floats and stays pinned


1337
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:58,876
to the content area where it's


1338
00:33:58,876 --> 00:34:00,616
at in the section, we just


1339
00:34:00,616 --> 00:34:02,046
specify PinToVisibleBounds.


1340
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,526
And then we need to associate


1341
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:05,516
the header and footer with the


1342
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:06,466
geometry it's going to be in,


1343
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:07,256
and that's the section.


1344
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:08,315
We just do that with the


1345
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:09,806
BoundarySupplementaryItems


1346
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:10,016
array.


1347
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:11,735
Pretty straightforward.


1348
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:13,786
All right.


1349
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,196
So by now you've played around


1350
00:34:15,196 --> 00:34:17,255
with the brand new iOS 13 card


1351
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,766
presentation, this whole card


1352
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:20,416
design language all throughout


1353
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:20,976
the system.


1354
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:23,666
And we see this in scrolling


1355
00:34:23,826 --> 00:34:26,156
UI's as well where all kinds of


1356
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:27,306
content is grouped together


1357
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:28,815
logically with cards.


1358
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:30,556
And this is a natural fit for


1359
00:34:30,556 --> 00:34:31,426
CollectionView because we always


1360
00:34:31,426 --> 00:34:32,556
had support for notions of


1361
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:33,536
decoration views.


1362
00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:35,545
Well, in the past you had to do


1363
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:36,446
the math yourself.


1364
00:34:36,446 --> 00:34:37,156
Well, now we've made it a lot


1365
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:38,735
simpler with compositional


1366
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:39,056
layout.


1367
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:41,166
And we support this with a


1368
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:42,706
CollectionLayoutDecorationItem.


1369
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:43,696
You just create it with an


1370
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:44,976
element kind and you're done.


1371
00:34:45,746 --> 00:34:47,436
This is intended to be used to


1372
00:34:47,436 --> 00:34:49,045
have a view that's behind the


1373
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,485
section content itself to give


1374
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:51,866
you that nice visual grouping.


1375
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:54,315
And to construct it, there's


1376
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:55,206
just one line of code.


1377
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:55,996
And then to add it to the


1378
00:34:55,996 --> 00:34:57,896
section, you just want to


1379
00:34:58,116 --> 00:34:59,916
specify the items and off you


1380
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:00,116
go.


1381
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:01,696
Here we go.


1382
00:35:02,256 --> 00:35:02,456
All right.


1383
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:03,816
So let's take a quick peek and


1384
00:35:03,816 --> 00:35:04,446
see what this looks like.


1385
00:35:04,876 --> 00:35:06,236
All right.


1386
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:08,586
Pretty straightforward.


1387
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:09,906
So there's our list with


1388
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:11,196
multiple sections, and we have


1389
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:13,286
our decoration views with just a


1390
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:14,096
single line of code.


1391
00:35:14,226 --> 00:35:14,946
So pretty simple.


1392
00:35:17,756 --> 00:35:18,536
All right.


1393
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:20,306
So here's a topic near and dear


1394
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:21,356
to my heart: Estimated


1395
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:22,176
cell-sizing.


1396
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:25,436
So in iOS 13 we spent a lot of


1397
00:35:25,436 --> 00:35:26,966
time making this fast and


1398
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:27,836
accurate.


1399
00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:30,806
And compositional layout extends


1400
00:35:30,806 --> 00:35:31,766
the notion of estimated


1401
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:33,896
cell-sizing in very specific


1402
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:34,406
ways.


1403
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:35,806
It allows you to do per-axis


1404
00:35:35,806 --> 00:35:36,616
cell-sizing.


1405
00:35:36,616 --> 00:35:37,816
And this is super important.


1406
00:35:38,496 --> 00:35:39,486
Because oftentimes the view


1407
00:35:39,486 --> 00:35:40,366
hierarchy that you want to get


1408
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:41,606
the content of when you render


1409
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,086
the content, you don't want to


1410
00:35:43,086 --> 00:35:44,736
necessarily be fully constrained


1411
00:35:44,866 --> 00:35:47,086
and wild on all the axes and


1412
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:48,546
grow on the X and grow on the Y.


1413
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,286
You might know how wide the


1414
00:35:50,286 --> 00:35:51,296
thing is, for example.


1415
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,716
An example of our headers and


1416
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,336
footers, we might know that we


1417
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:57,316
want it to be exactly the width


1418
00:35:57,316 --> 00:35:58,106
of the CollectionView.


1419
00:35:58,266 --> 00:35:59,546
But, you know, we want the


1420
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:00,756
height to vary a little bit.


1421
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:02,576
So I'm going to show an example


1422
00:36:02,576 --> 00:36:03,466
of this real quick.


1423
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:04,376
And we've already been in this


1424
00:36:04,376 --> 00:36:04,996
code before.


1425
00:36:05,636 --> 00:36:07,796
So here we see our very familiar


1426
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:10,206
sections, headers and footers.


1427
00:36:10,206 --> 00:36:11,216
I'm going to pull down here and


1428
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:13,846
go to my text size widget and


1429
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:14,566
ramp it up.


1430
00:36:15,896 --> 00:36:16,286
All right.


1431
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:17,716
So here everything's just


1432
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:18,326
adapted.


1433
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:19,336
It's done the right thing,


1434
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:19,746
right?


1435
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,336
Now, how do we do this?


1436
00:36:21,406 --> 00:36:21,926
All right.


1437
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:23,756
So here we can see that the


1438
00:36:23,756 --> 00:36:25,306
height dimension's estimated.


1439
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:26,616
That's all we did differently


1440
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:26,936
here, right?


1441
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:28,226
We specified that we knew


1442
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:29,606
exactly how wide this thing's


1443
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:31,026
going to be, but we don't know


1444
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:31,676
about the height.


1445
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:32,856
We just estimate it to be 44


1446
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:33,426
points.


1447
00:36:34,046 --> 00:36:35,316
So as the content's rendered, we


1448
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:36,436
have a better idea.


1449
00:36:36,436 --> 00:36:37,456
We can invalidate the layout


1450
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:38,096
automatically.


1451
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,026
And this happens all


1452
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:40,466
automatically, makes it really


1453
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:42,046
easy to support dynamic type in


1454
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:43,356
your applications, even with


1455
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:44,446
supplementaries and headers and


1456
00:36:44,446 --> 00:36:44,776
footers.


1457
00:36:44,776 --> 00:36:46,336
So this is -- this is pretty


1458
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:46,536
great.


1459
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:49,256
All right.


1460
00:36:49,256 --> 00:36:49,926
So now we're getting to some


1461
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:50,636
really fun stuff.


1462
00:36:50,636 --> 00:36:52,076
So what about nesting things?


1463
00:36:52,186 --> 00:36:53,386
So we talked about this notion


1464
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:54,606
of composition early on.


1465
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:56,066
Well, let's talk about how that


1466
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:56,646
works.


1467
00:36:57,436 --> 00:37:00,856
So the core layout thing inside


1468
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:01,606
of compositional layout is


1469
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,226
layout group.


1470
00:37:02,766 --> 00:37:04,416
And layout group is actually a


1471
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,556
subtype of


1472
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,766
NSCollectionLayoutItem.


1473
00:37:07,506 --> 00:37:09,006
Now, because this is a


1474
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:11,186
relationship, when you specify


1475
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:12,966
the items that are in a layout


1476
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:14,336
group, you can also have other


1477
00:37:14,336 --> 00:37:14,826
groups.


1478
00:37:14,826 --> 00:37:15,736
So you can nest these.


1479
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,186
And there's no limit to this


1480
00:37:17,226 --> 00:37:18,096
particular nesting, it's


1481
00:37:18,096 --> 00:37:18,636
arbitrary.


1482
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:21,086
And because we have this, it


1483
00:37:21,086 --> 00:37:23,356
unlocks a ton of interesting new


1484
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:24,146
designs.


1485
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:27,076
Okay. So in this example we see


1486
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:29,036
a group is compromised of three


1487
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:29,456
items.


1488
00:37:30,156 --> 00:37:32,006
And we see this big old monster


1489
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:33,716
on the leading side and it has a


1490
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:36,326
vertical group on the trailing


1491
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:37,246
side, right?


1492
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:38,676
So how would we reason about


1493
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:39,436
this in code?


1494
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:44,676
All right, so this is pretty


1495
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:45,366
straightforward, right?


1496
00:37:45,366 --> 00:37:46,646
We had this horizontal group on


1497
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:47,686
the bottom here.


1498
00:37:47,776 --> 00:37:49,546
And its subitems are the


1499
00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:52,026
leadingItem itself, right, and a


1500
00:37:52,026 --> 00:37:52,966
trailingGroup.


1501
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:54,236
So it's very easy to reason


1502
00:37:54,236 --> 00:37:55,186
about these kinds of things.


1503
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:56,226
We can see right away what we're


1504
00:37:56,226 --> 00:37:56,786
trying to do.


1505
00:37:56,786 --> 00:37:57,856
And we just compose in


1506
00:37:57,856 --> 00:37:59,416
additional stuff and we get


1507
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:01,126
these great layouts.


1508
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:03,136
All right.


1509
00:38:03,176 --> 00:38:05,106
So nested groups are pretty


1510
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:05,406
cool.


1511
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:07,256
But what about -- what about


1512
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:08,446
nesting CollectionViews?


1513
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:10,266
All right.


1514
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:14,296
So here we see the App Store,


1515
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,756
the refresh for iOS 13.


1516
00:38:17,516 --> 00:38:18,396
And I don't know about you, but


1517
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,146
when I was a third-party


1518
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:20,116
developer, if I saw this


1519
00:38:20,606 --> 00:38:21,826
particular design handed to me,


1520
00:38:21,826 --> 00:38:22,776
I'd have a heart attack.


1521
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:24,116
This is complicated stuff.


1522
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:25,916
This can be challenging.


1523
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:26,926
There's a lot of bookkeeping


1524
00:38:26,926 --> 00:38:27,496
involved.


1525
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:28,436
And -- but it's a common


1526
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:28,776
pattern.


1527
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:30,376
We see it all the time in


1528
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:32,236
today's applications.


1529
00:38:32,656 --> 00:38:34,686
And to make this perform well


1530
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:36,196
and look great is a bit of a


1531
00:38:36,196 --> 00:38:36,656
challenge.


1532
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:37,696
Well, compositional layout


1533
00:38:37,696 --> 00:38:39,366
solves this with one line of


1534
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:39,456
code.


1535
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:41,316
And I want to show you a demo of


1536
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:41,836
this right now.

[ Applause ]


1538
00:38:52,306 --> 00:38:54,246
Okay. So here we have the same


1539
00:38:54,246 --> 00:38:55,366
group I had from the prior one.


1540
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,146
But we notice the group's a


1541
00:38:56,146 --> 00:38:57,126
little bit squishier, right?


1542
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,846
It's about 80% of the


1543
00:38:58,846 --> 00:38:59,586
container's width.


1544
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:01,376
And this is a vertically


1545
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,376
scrolling CollectionView.


1546
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:03,706
It's got five sections on it.


1547
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:05,946
But each section scrolls


1548
00:39:05,946 --> 00:39:07,456
orthogonally with that single


1549
00:39:07,456 --> 00:39:07,876
line of code.

[ Applause ]


1551

All right.


1552
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:17,316
And we've got a ton of different


1553
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:18,086
variations of this.


1554
00:39:18,086 --> 00:39:18,646
And bear with me.


1555
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:19,536
I'm going to switch around here.


1556
00:39:19,596 --> 00:39:19,836
All right.


1557
00:39:19,836 --> 00:39:21,846
So we've got five different ways


1558
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:22,886
to do this, right, including the


1559
00:39:22,886 --> 00:39:24,206
none case, which I don't want


1560
00:39:24,206 --> 00:39:24,416
that.


1561
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,626
We have two continuous cases.


1562
00:39:26,876 --> 00:39:28,576
And then we have three paging


1563
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:29,176
cases.


1564
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:30,406
All right.


1565
00:39:30,406 --> 00:39:31,166
So I'm going to walk through


1566
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:34,666
each one of these in kind here.


1567
00:39:36,256 --> 00:39:37,016

1570
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:42,386
And continuous is just like


1571
00:39:42,386 --> 00:39:42,956
you'd expect it.


1572
00:39:42,956 --> 00:39:44,696
This is a very simple,


1573
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:46,086
straightforward scroll view-like


1574
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:46,896
behavior, you know?


1575
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:48,236
You -- you had me at bounce,


1576
00:39:48,236 --> 00:39:48,376
right?


1577
00:39:48,376 --> 00:39:51,446
It's got that great -- gosh, I


1578
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:52,506
could do this for hours, right?


1579
00:39:52,986 --> 00:39:54,226
All right.


1580
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,466
So that's just the normal scroll


1581
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:56,006
view behavior.


1582
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:57,186
But we have an additional one


1583
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,846
for this continuous, you know,


1584
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:00,516
fluid kind of scrolling that we


1585
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:01,996
call continuous group-leading


1586
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:02,316
boundary.


1587
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,356
And that's a mouthful but it's


1588
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:04,066
pretty descriptive.


1589
00:40:04,476 --> 00:40:05,696
So as we scroll and we impart


1590
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:07,836
volume to it, we naturally come


1591
00:40:07,836 --> 00:40:09,426
to rest at that group's


1592
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:10,976
semantic-leading boundary.

So you people that clap have


1595
00:40:17,006 --> 00:40:18,496
done targeted content offset or


1596
00:40:18,496 --> 00:40:19,716
proposed offset before and you


1597
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:20,356
know it's a pain.


1598
00:40:20,566 --> 00:40:21,696
All right.


1599
00:40:21,696 --> 00:40:23,016
So with the addition of the


1600
00:40:23,016 --> 00:40:24,926
continuous behaviors, we have


1601
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:26,216
some paging behaviors.


1602
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:27,276
And this gets really cool.


1603
00:40:27,276 --> 00:40:29,316
So this is just like the normal


1604
00:40:29,316 --> 00:40:30,856
scroll view paging behavior, and


1605
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:32,216
we named this behavior paging.


1606
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:33,696
Pretty creative.


1607
00:40:34,386 --> 00:40:35,526
And here we can see no matter


1608
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:36,866
how much velocity the user


1609
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:38,716
imparts, we just get one page of


1610
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:39,216
content.


1611
00:40:39,216 --> 00:40:40,826
And this page is defined as the


1612
00:40:40,826 --> 00:40:42,596
default scroll view behavior


1613
00:40:42,596 --> 00:40:44,206
where it's the width of the


1614
00:40:44,206 --> 00:40:44,796
CollectionView.


1615
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:48,266
We have two more variants to


1616
00:40:48,266 --> 00:40:48,866
this, okay?


1617
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,596
And as you can probably intuit,


1618
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:52,016
we have this notion of group


1619
00:40:52,106 --> 00:40:52,636
paging.


1620
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:54,526
So now we have the semantic


1621
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:55,906
notion of what a group is, we


1622
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:57,786
can make the page size be the


1623
00:40:57,786 --> 00:40:58,606
size of the group.

If you wanted to build UI like

this today using just flow


1694
00:43:05,276 --> 00:43:07,396
layout, you'd probably start


1695
00:43:07,396 --> 00:43:08,556
with a CollectionView that


1696
00:43:08,556 --> 00:43:09,366
scrolls in the vertical


1697
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:09,816
direction.


1698
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:14,046
Then for every single section


1699
00:43:14,236 --> 00:43:15,586
that scrolls on the horizontal


1700
00:43:15,586 --> 00:43:17,466
axis, you'd need an additional


1701
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:19,846
CollectionView, which means more


1702
00:43:19,846 --> 00:43:21,526
support code to intermediate the


1703
00:43:21,526 --> 00:43:23,726
presentation and behavior of


1704
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,406
each collection.

00:43:27,536 --> 00:43:29,576
With compositional layout, this


1706
00:43:29,576 --> 00:43:31,596
can be done using just a single


1707
00:43:31,596 --> 00:43:32,226
CollectionView.


1708
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:35,816
In fact, we've done just that.


1709
00:43:37,086 --> 00:43:39,386
In iOS 13, App Store has been


1710
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:40,806
rearchitected using


1711
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:41,736
compositional layout.


1712
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,436
Each of the content types you


1713
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:47,526
see on this page are capable of


1714
00:43:47,526 --> 00:43:49,096
vending their own layout


1715
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:49,646
description.


1716
00:43:50,146 --> 00:43:52,016
And all those layout sections


1717
00:43:52,016 --> 00:43:53,566
come together to comprise our


1718
00:43:53,566 --> 00:43:54,906
one overall


1719
00:43:54,906 --> 00:43:56,076
CollectionViewLayout.


1720
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:01,996
We describe this section using


1721
00:44:01,996 --> 00:44:03,996
just a single layout item which


1722
00:44:03,996 --> 00:44:05,756
has a known height and which


1723
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:07,856
occupies 100% of its container's


1724
00:44:07,856 --> 00:44:08,076
width.


1725
00:44:10,616 --> 00:44:12,266
That layout item sits inside of


1726
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:14,566
a layout group, which itself


1727
00:44:14,566 --> 00:44:16,346
occupies half of its container's


1728
00:44:16,346 --> 00:44:16,556
width.


1729
00:44:17,056 --> 00:44:19,796
And these are really all the


1730
00:44:19,796 --> 00:44:21,216
basic building blocks we need to


1731
00:44:21,216 --> 00:44:22,136
get this UI working.


1732
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:26,466
We take that layout group, stick


1733
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:28,556
it in a layout section, and to


1734
00:44:28,556 --> 00:44:29,746
get that paging behavior we


1735
00:44:29,746 --> 00:44:31,266
want, we set our orthogonal


1736
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:33,426
scroll behavior to group paging.


1737
00:44:34,156 --> 00:44:34,976
And we're off to the races.


1738
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:41,676
In iOS 13 App Store is also


1739
00:44:41,676 --> 00:44:43,636
getting UI support for languages


1740
00:44:43,636 --> 00:44:45,976
that read from right to left.


1741
00:44:45,976 --> 00:44:47,256
And compositional layout helps


1742
00:44:47,256 --> 00:44:48,436
make that possible.


1743
00:44:49,016 --> 00:44:52,456
We construct our layouts using


1744
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:53,656
all the same primitives that


1745
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:55,376
you've seen here today, and


1746
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:56,716
compositional layout just takes


1747
00:44:56,716 --> 00:44:57,556
care of the rest.


1748
00:44:58,056 --> 00:45:00,236
It ensures that the placement of


1749
00:45:00,236 --> 00:45:01,626
our supplementaries and our


1750
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:03,546
cells is appropriate for our


1751
00:45:03,546 --> 00:45:04,526
right to left environment.


1752
00:45:05,186 --> 00:45:07,456
And furthermore, we don't have


1753
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,326
to write a single line of code


1754
00:45:09,486 --> 00:45:10,976
to make sure that our paging


1755
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:13,106
behavior also translates for the


1756
00:45:13,106 --> 00:45:14,496
right to left layout direction.


1757
00:45:17,496 --> 00:45:20,216
So this new API has enabled to


1758
00:45:20,216 --> 00:45:21,946
us take all of those scrollable


1759
00:45:21,946 --> 00:45:23,466
regions that we were previously


1760
00:45:23,466 --> 00:45:25,746
micromanaging and flatten them


1761
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:27,956
into a single CollectionView at


1762
00:45:27,956 --> 00:45:28,576
the top level.


1763
00:45:28,576 --> 00:45:31,336
All the while, our code has


1764
00:45:31,336 --> 00:45:34,086
become more concise, easy to


1765
00:45:34,086 --> 00:45:36,286
reason about, as well as easier


1766
00:45:36,286 --> 00:45:37,736
to maintain going forward.


1767
00:45:40,016 --> 00:45:41,466
Compositional layout has


1768
00:45:41,526 --> 00:45:42,966
reimagined the way that we think


1769
00:45:42,966 --> 00:45:44,686
about CollectionViews in our own


1770
00:45:44,686 --> 00:45:46,546
application, and we can't wait


1771
00:45:46,546 --> 00:45:47,756
to see how it enhances the


1772
00:45:47,756 --> 00:45:49,436
experience for the apps that all


1773
00:45:49,436 --> 00:45:50,756
of you bring to the App Store.


1774
00:45:50,756 --> 00:45:51,936
Back to you, Troy.

[ Applause ]


1776
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:58,556
>> Troy Stephens: Thank you so


1777
00:45:58,556 --> 00:45:59,206
much, Dersu.


1778
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:00,386
Boy, that is a beautiful


1779
00:46:00,386 --> 00:46:00,996
redesign.


1780
00:46:01,376 --> 00:46:02,996
And we couldn't be more thrilled


1781
00:46:03,116 --> 00:46:04,406
to see compositional layout


1782
00:46:04,436 --> 00:46:05,816
already making a difference


1783
00:46:06,236 --> 00:46:07,346
simplifying the development


1784
00:46:07,346 --> 00:46:08,926
process for one of our prominent


1785
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:10,446
user-facing apps.


1786
00:46:10,446 --> 00:46:13,046
And I'm so happy to be making


1787
00:46:13,046 --> 00:46:14,556
the same API available to


1788
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:16,756
developers across our platforms.


1789
00:46:17,186 --> 00:46:18,516
Speaking of which, I'd like to


1790
00:46:18,516 --> 00:46:19,986
show you a real quick demo of


1791
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,396
compositional layout working


1792
00:46:21,396 --> 00:46:23,866
with NSCollectionView on Mac OS.


1793
00:46:29,596 --> 00:46:31,086
So when you open the sample


1794
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:32,316
project that you downloaded in


1795
00:46:32,316 --> 00:46:34,196
Xcode, notice that there's a


1796
00:46:34,196 --> 00:46:35,686
build scheme and target for the


1797
00:46:35,686 --> 00:46:35,866
Mac.


1798
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:37,596
And we're going to build and run


1799
00:46:37,596 --> 00:46:37,976
that here.


1800
00:46:42,126 --> 00:46:43,656
And let's just open up all of


1801
00:46:43,656 --> 00:46:45,206
our layout examples that we


1802
00:46:45,206 --> 00:46:47,016
looked at in this talk, and


1803
00:46:47,016 --> 00:46:47,816
we'll fan them out.


1804
00:46:51,276 --> 00:46:52,046
So here we go.


1805
00:46:52,046 --> 00:46:53,096
Here they are, our various


1806
00:46:53,096 --> 00:46:54,376
compositional layout examples.


1807
00:46:54,696 --> 00:46:55,876
And these are essentially just


1808
00:46:55,876 --> 00:46:57,326
the same code that we use.


1809
00:46:57,326 --> 00:46:58,916
We're programming to the same


1810
00:46:58,916 --> 00:46:59,356
API's.


1811
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:00,536
The only adjustments you're


1812
00:47:00,536 --> 00:47:01,636
really going to see are for


1813
00:47:01,636 --> 00:47:03,816
metrics where we wanted to apply


1814
00:47:03,816 --> 00:47:05,336
more macOS-appropriate metrics


1815
00:47:05,336 --> 00:47:05,896
for things.


1816
00:47:05,896 --> 00:47:07,816
But we have orthogonal scrolling


1817
00:47:07,816 --> 00:47:08,666
working here.


1818
00:47:10,176 --> 00:47:12,786
And, of course, on the Mac we


1819
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:13,836
expect things to behave in


1820
00:47:13,836 --> 00:47:14,636
Mac-like ways.


1821
00:47:14,636 --> 00:47:15,396
And one of the things that can


1822
00:47:15,396 --> 00:47:16,396
happen with CollectionViews on


1823
00:47:16,396 --> 00:47:17,636
the Mac is they're continually


1824
00:47:17,636 --> 00:47:19,066
resizable usually, right?


1825
00:47:19,446 --> 00:47:21,546
So we've got -- we've made sure


1826
00:47:21,546 --> 00:47:23,286
that resize is nice and fast,


1827
00:47:24,176 --> 00:47:25,296
super light-weight, these


1828
00:47:25,506 --> 00:47:27,286
layouts reevaluate very quickly.


1829
00:47:27,286 --> 00:47:29,156
And our adaptive sections layout


1830
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,556
has a layout break just like


1831
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,076
before.


1832
00:47:31,076 --> 00:47:32,606
And now that you know how this


1833
00:47:32,606 --> 00:47:33,886
works, you can easily add


1834
00:47:33,886 --> 00:47:35,126
additional layout breaks for


1835
00:47:35,126 --> 00:47:36,876
wider window widths and screen


1836
00:47:36,876 --> 00:47:37,546
widths if you want.


1837
00:47:38,226 --> 00:47:40,386
Of course, we have features like


1838
00:47:40,386 --> 00:47:41,496
being able to click items to


1839
00:47:41,496 --> 00:47:42,116
select them.


1840
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,626
I can use the arrow keys and


1841
00:47:44,626 --> 00:47:45,656
navigate around.


1842
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,756
I can hold down the shift key


1843
00:47:47,756 --> 00:47:48,736
while arrowing around to


1844
00:47:48,736 --> 00:47:49,926
accumulate a selection.

1846

And, of course, I can drag to

rubber band select.


1848
00:47:56,026 --> 00:47:57,266

00:48:00,536 --> 00:48:01,976
more advanced ones like this.

would expect on the Mac.


1855

1865
00:48:23,396 --> 00:48:24,846

changes, and try different

things, and iterate on them is

00:49:08,526 --> 00:49:10,266
iteration with your designers.


1893
00:49:10,606 --> 00:49:12,016
So we think this is a really big


1894
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:12,786
game-changer.


1895
00:49:14,256 --> 00:49:15,606
So go out, take the sample


1896
00:49:15,606 --> 00:49:17,806
project, experiment with it, try


1897
00:49:17,846 --> 00:49:19,946
changing various things, use our


1898
00:49:19,946 --> 00:49:21,746
code as a basis for yours and


1899
00:49:21,746 --> 00:49:23,606
start working on the custom


1900
00:49:23,606 --> 00:49:25,266
layouts for your next app


1901
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:25,686
versions.


1902
00:49:25,956 --> 00:49:27,026
And we can't wait to see the


1903
00:49:27,026 --> 00:49:28,696
delightful user experiences that


1904
00:49:28,696 --> 00:49:29,986
this is going to empower you to


1905
00:49:29,986 --> 00:49:31,886
create in a fraction of the


1906
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:32,326
time.


1907
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:34,426
Now, if you found this talk


1908
00:49:34,426 --> 00:49:35,766
exciting, we've got another that


1909
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:36,616
I think you're really going to


1910
00:49:36,616 --> 00:49:37,696
love, especially if you work


1911
00:49:37,696 --> 00:49:39,316
with collection views or even UI


1912
00:49:39,316 --> 00:49:40,046
table views.


1913
00:49:40,286 --> 00:49:42,486
In Advances in UI Data Sources


1914
00:49:42,806 --> 00:49:44,816
we introduce an entirely new


1915
00:49:45,006 --> 00:49:47,126
radically simpler API for


1916
00:49:47,126 --> 00:49:48,806
feeding model data to your


1917
00:49:48,806 --> 00:49:50,446
CollectionViews and your UI


1918
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,016
table views while getting


1919
00:49:52,016 --> 00:49:53,266
automatic computation of


1920
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:54,646
differences and automatic


1921
00:49:54,646 --> 00:49:55,596
animations for free.


1922
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:56,666
It's going to create delightful


1923
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:57,666
users experiences.


1924
00:49:57,666 --> 00:49:59,276
So make sure to check this


1925
00:49:59,276 --> 00:49:59,876
session out.


1926
00:50:01,046 --> 00:50:02,546
Thank you so much for watching.
