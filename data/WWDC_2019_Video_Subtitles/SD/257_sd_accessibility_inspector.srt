1
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:15,956
>> Good morning everyone.


2
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,636
My name is Gary and I am an


3
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:20,216
engineer on the Accessibility


4
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:20,416
Team.


5
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:23,426
Today, I'm excited to talk about


6
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:25,876
a tool called Accessibility


7
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:26,416
Inspector.


8
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,156
The Accessibility Inspector


9
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:35,306
provides an easy way to find,


10
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:38,296
diagnose, and fix accessibility


11
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:39,746
issues within your app.


12
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:42,786
In this presentation, we will be


13
00:00:42,786 --> 00:00:44,256
doing exactly that, using a


14
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:44,816
sample app.


15
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:46,286
Let's jump right into it.


16
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:53,996
So here this is my Peanut Butter


17
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:54,586
Tracking App.


18
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:56,446
It helps my fellow peanut butter


19
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:56,896
lovers.


20
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:59,186
Tracks their favor brand, rate,


21
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:00,946
them and record details about


22
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:01,126
them.


23
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,216
Tapping on the particular cell


24
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:04,885
will bring me to the Detail View


25
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:05,986
for that particular brand.


26
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:08,996
And in here, I can take photos


27
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,426
of my favorite peanut butter.


28
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:13,966
I could favorite it or I could


29
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:15,146
buy it again and share with my


30
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:15,436
friends.


31
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:17,856
Now I want to test for


32
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:19,366
accessibility issues from my


33
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,366
Detailed View but I'm not quite


34
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:22,336
sure where to start.


35
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:24,956
The Accessibility Inspector


36
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:26,556
makes this daunting task easy.


37
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:28,466
Let's start by opening the


38
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:29,236
Accessibility Inspector.


39
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:33,026
So first, I'll go over to XCode


40
00:01:34,116 --> 00:01:36,156
and under the XCode Menu you'll


41
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:38,016
see Open Developer Tools.


42
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:41,696
And in here, you can find the


43
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:42,556
Accessibility Inspector.


44
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,296
You might notice what seems to


45
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:45,856
be a large tooltip.


46
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:48,426
This is actually a new feature


47
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:49,916
that we added for low vision


48
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:50,856
user on the Mac.


49
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:53,516
It is called Hover Text and it


50
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:55,006
makes anything under the mouse


51
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:56,866
cursor larger and sharper to


52
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,106
see.


53
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:58,986
And we'll be using it throughout


54
00:01:58,986 --> 00:01:59,566
our demo today.


55
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:07,626
[ Applause ]


56
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:09,936
So now with Inspector open, I'm


57
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:11,015
going to use the Target


58
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:13,086
Selection Drop Down to select my


59
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:13,596
iOS device.


60
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:18,526
The Inspector has three main


61
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:18,756
parts.


62
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:22,336
First, the Inspector tab.


63
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:24,906
Then the Audit tab.


64
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:26,996
And the Settings tab.


65
00:02:26,996 --> 00:02:28,236
Let's focus on the Audit tab for


66
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:28,426
now.


67
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,156
This is one of the easiest ways


68
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:33,686
to help me find accessibility


69
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,256
issues in my app.


70
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,066
By pressing on the Run Audit


71
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:38,906
button, you'll get a list of


72
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:40,636
potential accessibility issues.


73
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:45,856
So let's try that for our view.


74
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:47,586
Immediately, you see that it


75
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:48,686
found a bunch of issues.


76
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:51,366
And clicking on the issue will


77
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:52,416
highlight the problematic


78
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,296
element in yellow.


79
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:57,276
Let's start in the middle with


80
00:02:57,276 --> 00:03:00,496
Image name used in description.


81
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,046
This issue seems to affect all


82
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:03,016
three of our custom buttons.


83
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:06,136
Assistive technologies like


84
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:08,156
VoiceOver uses accessibility


85
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:10,086
information such as a Label to


86
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:13,176
help users interact and navigate


87
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:14,656
with the UI in your view.


88
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,366
But how exactly do we provide


89
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:18,686
such information to the


90
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:19,396
assisting technologies?


91
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:22,456
You can click on the Help button


92
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:24,236
on the right to get a suggestion


93
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:27,596
for what to do.


94
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,296
So here it states that consider


95
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:30,736
setting a human readable,


96
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:33,466
localized accessibilityLabel.


97
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,026
Now let's head back to our


98
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:39,516
Inspector tab.


99
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:41,176
Now I want to inspect for my


100
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:41,846
custom buttons.


101
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:45,066
And to do that, you'll press the


102
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:47,266
Point Inspection button on the


103
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:48,966
top.


104
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:51,656
Now with my fingers down on the


105
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:54,876
screen, I can move around and


106
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:56,796
focus on any accessible element.


107
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:58,706
Let's start with the Custom


108
00:03:59,316 --> 00:03:59,466
button.


109
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,456
Here under the Basic section,


110
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,606
you'll see the Label property is


111
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:06,696
set to the Image File Name.


112
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:09,746
This creates a poor experience


113
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:10,456
for our users.


114
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:13,316
And to help you get an idea of


115
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:15,266
this experience, we added a new


116
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:16,846
feature that will simulate a


117
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:18,636
VoiceOver would say by


118
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:19,796
pressing on the speaker button.


119
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:23,236
>> Camera.on.rectangle button.


120
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:25,846
>> And I can use the Next button


121
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:27,186
to jump to the next element.


122
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:28,916
>> Sue.heart button.


123
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:31,966
Cart.badge.plus button.


124
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:34,286
>> So as we navigated over the


125
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:36,246
buttons, we heard unhelpful


126
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:36,716
descriptions.


127
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:39,566
These descriptions didn't really


128
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,206
tell us what the buttons do.


129
00:04:42,426 --> 00:04:43,986
So let's jump into Code and add


130
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:45,326
some meaningful Labels for


131
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:45,866
Custom buttons.


132
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:53,806
To add a Label, we'll simply set


133
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:55,666
the accessibility Label


134
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,806
attribute under View.


135
00:04:58,176 --> 00:05:00,156
So for my Favorite button, I'll


136
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:01,736
set it equal to the state of


137
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:02,196
favorite.


138
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:06,116
And for my Camera button, I'll


139
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:08,076
simply set it to take a photo.


140
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:12,486
And for my Buy button, I'll set


141
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:13,036
it as Buy.


142
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:15,366
And remember to properly


143
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:16,186
localize your string.


144
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:18,846
So now let's head back to the


145
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:21,236
Inspector to see our remaining


146
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:21,626
issues.


147
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,276
Here it looks like there's a


148
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:29,686
potentially inaccessible text.


149
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:33,556
If you're using sender UIKit or


150
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:35,066
app key controls, then


151
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,346
accessibility comes for free.


152
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:39,136
However, in this case, we're


153
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:41,066
drawing the brand name using


154
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,396
CATextLayer, which means we're


155
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:45,536
responsible for handling our own


156
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:46,166
accessibility.


157
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,386
Let's jump into Code to see how


158
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:50,726
we can make this Custom text


159
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:51,376
accessible.


160
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:56,766
So the first thing that I'll


161
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,236
have to do is to let the


162
00:05:58,236 --> 00:06:00,036
assistive technologies know that


163
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:01,506
this is an accessibility element


164
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:05,136
and to do that, I'll simply set


165
00:06:05,256 --> 00:06:06,996
the isAccessibilityElement to


166
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:07,766
true.


167
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:11,276
Next, I'll have to give it a


168
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:12,026
meaningful Label.


169
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:15,246
And in our case, we'll set it


170
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:17,426
equal to the brandName and


171
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:19,566
that's it.


172
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:20,586
So let's jump back to the


173
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:22,026
Inspector to see our final


174
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:22,316
issue.


175
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:27,136
Here it looks like there's a


176
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,496
contrast problem for our


177
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:28,896
brandName.


178
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,106
We can click on the Disclosure


179
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:32,826
triangle to get a more detailed


180
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:33,586
explanation.


181
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:38,636
Here it shows a contrast ratio


182
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,246
and the color we used to


183
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:40,846
calculate it.


184
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:43,916
Displaying information in a


185
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,766
clear and legible manner is


186
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:46,136
crucial.


187
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:49,716
But it looks like the contrast


188
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,146
for our brand name is too poor


189
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:54,716
for the users to pick out text.


190
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:59,136
Let's click on the Help button.


191
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,666
Here it says that the


192
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,156
recommended contrast ratio


193
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:03,736
should be above 3.0.


194
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:05,896
But how do we achieve this


195
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:06,206
ratio?


196
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:09,486
The Accessibility Inspector has


197
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:11,256
a helpful tool called the Color


198
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:12,226
Contrast Calculator.


199
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:15,736
This tool insures that the text


200
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,216
and it's background meets the


201
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:18,496
recommended contrast ratio.


202
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:20,846
And we can find that tool by


203
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:24,236
going to Menus, Windows, Show


204
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:27,936
Color Contrast Calculator.


205
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:33,276
And now I'll click on the Color


206
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:36,026
Picker to select the light gray


207
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:38,946
color that I used for the brand


208
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:39,706
name.


209
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:43,766
Here you see that the contrast


210
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:46,746
ratio is 2.3 which is below the


211
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:48,116
recommended 3.0 ratio.


212
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:50,926
So now I'm going to use a slider


213
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:53,656
to pick a color to satisfy the


214
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:55,796
contrast ratio without


215
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:57,416
compromising my original design.


216
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,456
And this dark gray color looks


217
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:01,066
just about right.


218
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:02,866
Let's use that in our color.


219
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:10,736
So the first thing now I have to


220
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:13,586
do is to add the darkGrayColor,


221
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:15,666
then I'll set the


222
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:18,706
foregroundColor for my textLayer


223
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:21,076
to be the color that we just


224
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:21,326
added.


225
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,326
Now for the moment of truth,


226
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:27,716
let's run the app again to see


227
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:33,046
how it works.


228
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:34,706
While the app is running, I'm


229
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:36,515
going to open the Inspector.


230
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:43,376
To verify that all of our


231
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,356
changes works, I'm going to run


232
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:46,496
the Audit test once more.


233
00:08:49,956 --> 00:08:52,106
Great. It looks like all of the


234
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:52,936
warnings are gone.


235
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:58,546
[ Applause ]


236
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:00,086
Let's head over to the Inspector


237
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,906
tab to see how VoiceOver would


238
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:04,086
work on this view by pressing on


239
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,276
the Auto Navigate button.


240
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:08,326
>> Nutter Buddy button.


241
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,106
Patty's creamy header.


242
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:12,326
Patty's peanut butter jar image.


243
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:13,836
Take a photo button.


244
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:15,036
Favorite button.


245
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:16,076
Buy button.


246
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:17,746
Creamy bullet no-stir.


247
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:18,786
This tastes great.


248
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,076
>> And that's a much better


249
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:22,576
experience.


250
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:34,256
These are just some of the ways


251
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:35,536
of how the Accessibility


252
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:37,396
Inspector can help you create a


253
00:09:37,456 --> 00:09:38,806
fantastic app experience.


254
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:41,396
It is a powerful tool to help


255
00:09:41,396 --> 00:09:44,006
you find and fix accessibility


256
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:46,926
issues and an easy way to get


257
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:48,266
started with accessibility.


258
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:51,126
I encourage you to spend a few


259
00:09:51,126 --> 00:09:53,356
minutes to audit for your own


260
00:09:53,356 --> 00:09:56,016
apps and to make sure that your


261
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,756
app is accessible for everyone.
