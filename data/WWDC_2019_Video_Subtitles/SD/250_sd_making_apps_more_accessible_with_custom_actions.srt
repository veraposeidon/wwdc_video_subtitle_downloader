00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:12,826
>> Hi, everyone.


3
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:14,326
My name is Dan.


4
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:15,636
I'm an engineer on the


5
00:00:15,636 --> 00:00:17,316
Accessibility Team, and I'm


6
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:18,506
super excited to be talking to


7
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:20,086
you about Accessibility Custom


8
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,696
Actions and how they can improve


9
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:23,336
the experience for people using


10
00:00:23,336 --> 00:00:24,976
assistive technologies with your


11
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:25,346
apps.


12
00:00:25,996 --> 00:00:26,646
Let's get started.


13
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:29,656
Custom actions are really great


14
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:30,386
for two things.


15
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:32,826
The first is reducing clutter in


16
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:33,206
your app.


17
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:35,436
This is important for everyone


18
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,026
that uses your app, but it's


19
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:38,256
especially important for people


20
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:39,796
that use assistive technologies,


21
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:40,916
and I'll explain why.


22
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,346
The second is all about


23
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:44,736
improving the convenience and


24
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:46,066
speed of more complex


25
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:47,906
interactions in your app.


26
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,216
Let's start by talking about


27
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,426
reducing clutter and to do this


28
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:53,196
I'd like to talk about


29
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:53,786
VoiceOver.


30
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:55,986
VoiceOver is the built-in screen


31
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:57,076
reader we ship across many of


32
00:00:57,076 --> 00:00:58,246
our products for people who are


33
00:00:58,246 --> 00:00:59,406
blind and low vision.


34
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:01,746
People that use VoiceOver can


35
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:02,886
navigate through their apps in a


36
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:04,936
variety of ways but one way


37
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,616
that's particularly popular when


38
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:07,986
navigating through a new app or


39
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,066
interface is by swiping left and


40
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,606
right to move between the next


41
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:12,366
and previous item.


42
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:15,756
I have an app I've been working


43
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:16,866
on to help me track my favorite


44
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:17,586
types of peanut butter.


45
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:19,486
If you were going to use this


46
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:22,066
app without using VoiceOver and


47
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:23,326
we wanted to increase the rating


48
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:24,466
of the second jar of peanut


49
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:26,886
butter in this list, how do we


50
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:27,476
go about doing that?


51
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:30,766
Well, you'd probably visually


52
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:32,396
scan the list until you found


53
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:33,336
the jar you were looking for.


54
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:35,746
You then might focus on that


55
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:37,276
cell and look for the button


56
00:01:37,276 --> 00:01:38,416
that affords the action you want


57
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:41,486
to perform and then tap on it.


58
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:43,396
Now that may seem pretty


59
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:46,026
intuitive but that's because the


60
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:47,426
UI affords that intuition by


61
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:48,846
logically grouping the buttons


62
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:51,036
with the cells, which makes the


63
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:52,806
content easy for us to process


64
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:56,016
and digest, but what if instead


65
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,136
the app was laid out a bit


66
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:57,666
differently?


67
00:01:58,726 --> 00:02:01,036
Perhaps something like this.


68
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,996
Notice the buttons are now


69
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:05,566
underneath the cells, which


70
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:06,736
means we have a lot more content


71
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:07,396
to scroll through.


72
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,735
Additionally, it's much more


73
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,296
ambiguous as to which buttons


74
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:12,486
correspond to which cells.


75
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:15,276
This could very well be the


76
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:16,736
experience for someone using


77
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,026
VoiceOver with your app.


78
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:19,806
Let me show you what I mean.


79
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:21,776
Let's take a look at what it's


80
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:23,206
like to use VoiceOver to


81
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:24,046
navigate through one of the


82
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:25,806
cells of this app.


83
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,116
>> Patty's, creamy, Noster rated


84
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:30,926
1 out of 5.


85
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:33,116
Add to favorites button.


86
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:35,296
Decrease rating button.


87
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:37,596
Increase rating button.


88
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:40,816
>> After we swipe past the cell


89
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:43,696
we focused on three buttons, add


90
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,546
to favorites, decrease rating


91
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:47,776
and increase rating and those


92
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:49,166
three buttons exist in every


93
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,386
single cell in this list.


94
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,096
So if we were trying to find the


95
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:55,106
10th jar, we would have listened


96
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:57,726
to those buttons 30 times, which


97
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:59,146
can very quickly get repetitive.


98
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:01,426
Additionally, we have to keep in


99
00:03:01,426 --> 00:03:02,846
our head what the last jar of


100
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:03,926
peanut butter we heard was,


101
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:06,156
otherwise we don't know what


102
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:07,366
content is going to be affected


103
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:08,546
when we activate one of those


104
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:09,000
controls.


105
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,206
So let's take a look at the app


106
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,356
only this time designed a bit


107
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:13,836
differently.


108
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:15,556
I've changed the buttons so that


109
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:16,676
they're no longer accessible to


110
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:17,246
VoiceOver.


111
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:19,246
I've added custom actions to the


112
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:21,006
cells so that when VoiceOver


113
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,536
lands on a cell we can swipe up


114
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,956
or down with one finger to


115
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:25,496
choose an action and then double


116
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,486
tap to perform it.


117
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:27,626
Let's take a look.


118
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:32,456
>> Patty's, creamy, Noster rated


119
00:03:32,456 --> 00:03:33,626
1 out of 5.


120
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,126
Anna's, chunky, sugar-free,


121
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,096
rated 4 out of 5.


122
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:40,416
Actions available toggle


123
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,226
favorite, increase rating.


124
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:46,596
>> This time when we swipe past


125
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:48,576
the cell we just got to the next


126
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,586
one which made it much easier


127
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:51,526
for us to go through this


128
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:52,876
content and find what we are


129
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:53,446
looking for.


130
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:55,996
Once we found it, we could then


131
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:57,536
drill in and pick an interaction


132
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,086
from there, which much more


133
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:00,556
closely matches the experience


134
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:01,786
we talked about earlier of


135
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:03,626
visually scanning a list.


136
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:06,446
So custom actions can really


137
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,656
help us reduce clutter, we


138
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:10,146
remove the repetitive controls,


139
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:11,676
and we also reduced the


140
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,266
cognitive load on ourselves


141
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,346
while we were using the app.


142
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:16,685
Because we're explicitly picking


143
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:18,305
an interaction after finding the


144
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:19,906
content we want to interact with


145
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:22,166
it's no longer ambiguous what


146
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,096
those controls do.


147
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,296
All of this simplified the


148
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:25,866
experience.


149
00:04:28,696 --> 00:04:30,436
Next let's talk about how custom


150
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,646
actions can improve the


151
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,126
convenience and speed of more


152
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:34,496
complex interactions in your app


153
00:04:35,546 --> 00:04:36,566
and to do this I'd like to talk


154
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:37,386
about Switch Control.


155
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:39,686
This is another feature we ship


156
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:41,096
for people with limited mobility


157
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:42,706
and these people can interact


158
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:43,996
with their devices using as few


159
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:45,316
as one or two inputs.


160
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:48,096
I've added some additional


161
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:49,186
functionality into the peanut


162
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:50,836
butter app so that when we long


163
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:52,596
press on a cell an action sheet


164
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,016
comes up with additional options


165
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:55,896
including the option to send


166
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,126
information about one of the


167
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:58,186
jars of peanut butter to a


168
00:04:58,186 --> 00:04:58,576
friend.


169
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:00,586
I have two switches paired with


170
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:00,986
the device.


171
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,336
The orange switch will move


172
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:04,566
Switch Control's focus to the


173
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:06,646
next item and the white switch


174
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:07,636
will select that item.


175
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:09,996
Keep in mind switches can be


176
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:11,016
designed for a variety of


177
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:11,516
different needs.


178
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,566
So, for example, someone might


179
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:14,696
have switches mounted to a


180
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:15,566
wheelchair that they can


181
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,346
activate with their head.


182
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:18,656
Let's take a look at what it's


183
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:20,866
like to Switch Control to send


184
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,076
information about that second


185
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:23,066
jar of peanut butter to our


186
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:23,500
friend.


187
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:27,196
So we can use our orange switch


188
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:28,516
to navigate down to the second


189
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:30,066
cell and then use the white


190
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:31,116
switch to select it.


191
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:32,836
This brings up the Switch


192
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:34,336
Control Menu which provides


193
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,656
additional options of ways we


194
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:36,726
can interact with the cell.


195
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:39,056
We can navigate down to the page


196
00:05:39,056 --> 00:05:40,896
control and select it to view


197
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:41,666
more options.


198
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:44,446
From here, we can press select


199
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:46,106
to drill in and then navigate


200
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:46,906
over to gestures.


201
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:49,246
Selecting this will give us a


202
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:50,836
list of all of the gestures we


203
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:52,276
might have wanted to perform by


204
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:53,096
touching the display.


205
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:55,926
From here we can navigate down


206
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:57,246
to the second row and press


207
00:05:57,246 --> 00:05:59,046
select to drill in and then


208
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:00,576
navigate over to tap and hold.


209
00:06:01,576 --> 00:06:03,006
Selecting this will perform our


210
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:04,496
long press gesture and bring up


211
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:06,126
our action sheet, which we can


212
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:08,126
then navigate through to select


213
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:08,996
send to a friend.


214
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:12,556
We'll perform the tap and we're


215
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:13,000
done.


216
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:17,356
Now if you think about it, we


217
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:19,886
did all of that and we never


218
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:20,726
touched the display.


219
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:23,316
That's pretty cool, right?


220
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:26,156
But you also probably noticed


221
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:27,386
that that interaction normally


222
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,946
takes us two taps, one long


223
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:31,646
press and one tap on the action


224
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:33,806
sheet and with Switch Control


225
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:38,186
that took us 18 taps, but custom


226
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:39,756
actions can significantly reduce


227
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:40,256
that number.


228
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,596
So let's take a look again only


229
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:44,706
this time I've added custom


230
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:45,826
actions back into the app.


231
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,006
We'll still use the orange


232
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:49,156
switch to navigate down to the


233
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:51,436
second cell only this time when


234
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:53,276
we select it right away on the


235
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:54,526
first page of the Switch Control


236
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:56,066
Menu are all of the actions of


237
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:56,716
we've implemented.


238
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:59,306
We can drill in, navigate over


239
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:01,056
to send to a friend, press


240
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,736
select and we're done.


241
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:06,326
We didn't even need to navigate


242
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:07,396
through the action sheet that


243
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:08,386
came up the first time.


244
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:10,866
We're right where we need to be.


245
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,516
That was a significantly faster


246
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,066
interaction.


247
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,626
We were able to take those 18


248
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:18,896
taps and we get all the way down


249
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,836
to 6 taps, which is 67% fewer


250
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:22,806
taps than before.


251
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:26,366
So custom actions can provide


252
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:27,926
huge wins for convenience and


253
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:28,336
speed.


254
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:30,566
We removed the cumbersome


255
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,036
gestures which significantly


256
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,036
sped up the interaction.


257
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:35,286
Additionally, we improved the


258
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:36,856
prominence and the convenience


259
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,466
of those interaction options by


260
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:39,666
placing them on the first page


261
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,656
of the Switch Control Menu.


262
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:42,566
We didn't need to navigate


263
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:44,166
through several submenus and try


264
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,526
out different gestures to figure


265
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:46,516
what might be possible.


266
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:48,526
Instead, everything was much


267
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:50,606
more straightforward and direct.


268
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:52,746
Now I bet after hearing all


269
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:54,266
these awesome advantages of


270
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,946
custom actions you just can't


271
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:57,116
wait to use them in your apps


272
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:58,896
and luckily it's pretty easy.


273
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:00,926
You simply override the


274
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:02,286
Accessibility Custom Actions


275
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:04,406
property on your view and return


276
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:06,026
an array of UI accessibility,


277
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:07,236
custom action objects.


278
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:09,886
Each one takes in a name, a


279
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:11,036
target, and a selector.


280
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:13,676
Your function simply needs to


281
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:14,936
return a Boolean as to whether


282
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:16,226
or not the action was successful


283
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:18,466
and take in an UI accessibility


284
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:19,696
custom action object as a


285
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:20,136
parameter.


286
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:23,316
New this year we have a version


287
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:24,626
of the API that takes in an


288
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:25,936
action handler instead of a


289
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:26,756
target and selector.


290
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:28,576
So if using a block of code


291
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:29,606
better fits with the design of


292
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:30,996
your app, we encourage you to


293
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:31,656
give this a try.


294

[ Applause ]


295
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:36,866
Yes.


296
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:39,226
Additionally, if you're going to


297
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:40,716
use a custom action to replace


298
00:08:40,716 --> 00:08:41,895
something like an accessory


299
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,756
control inside of a cell, you'll


300
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,776
often want to set is


301
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:46,236
accessibility element to false


302
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:47,786
on those controls so they're no


303
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:48,706
longer navigable by the


304
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:49,646
assistive technology.


305
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:52,786
And what we talked about our


306
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,256
VoiceOver and Switch Control in


307
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:56,486
our demos today, custom actions


308
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:57,786
can be leveraged across many of


309
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:59,036
the assistive technologies we


310
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:00,956
ship including full keyboard


311
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:02,426
access and voice control which


312
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:03,116
are new this year.


313
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:04,976
I really encourage you to turn


314
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:06,526
some of these features on and


315
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:07,866
play around with your apps to


316
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:09,356
look for ways custom actions can


317
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:10,346
improve the experience.


318
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:11,826
Thank you very much.
