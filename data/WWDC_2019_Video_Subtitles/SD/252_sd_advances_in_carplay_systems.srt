00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:09,166
>> Hi, this is Tom from the Car


3
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:10,586
Experience Team at Apple and


4
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:12,166
welcome to our talk on Advances


5
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,246
in CarPlay Systems.


6
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:16,656
As you know, CarPlay is the


7
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:18,636
smarter, safer way to use your


8
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:20,766
iPhone in the car.


9
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,716
iOS 13 has a ton of new updates


10
00:00:22,716 --> 00:00:24,576
to CarPlay including the all-new


11
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,326
CarPlay Dashboard for a simple


12
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,746
view of your tunes, turns and


13
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:30,186
Smart Siri suggestions.


14
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:32,235
In this session we will


15
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:33,436
introduce you to vehicle


16
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:34,826
integration features newly


17
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,546
available in iOS 13.


18
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:38,746
All of the features we will talk


19
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:40,096
about today will require the


20
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:42,006
vehicle system to adopt new APIs


21
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:43,456
available in the CarPlay


22
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:47,506
Communication plug-in R15.


23
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,926
Today we will introduce new


24
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:50,696
display and audio features in


25
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:51,856
CarPlay that you can take


26
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:53,566
advantage of in future vehicles.


27
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,956
First up, let's look at how


28
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,406
CarPlay supports irregularly


29
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,406
shaped displays.


30
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:01,866
The vehicle declares the


31
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,786
physical size and resolution of


32
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:04,786
the display and iPhone will


33
00:01:04,786 --> 00:01:07,416
setup an H.264 video stream of


34
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,836
that size which will be rendered


35
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:09,456
to the display.


36
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:12,606
Prior to iOS 13, the CarPlay UI


37
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,566
would be drawn up to each edge


38
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:15,526
of the video screen.


39
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,426
However, some car displays are


40
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:19,976
fitted with pieces of trim that


41
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:21,636
may obscure parts of the CarPlay


42
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:23,566
user interface, restricting


43
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:24,776
access to some touchable


44
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:26,506
controls and preventing the user


45
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:27,926
from being able to see certain


46
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:28,876
parts of the UI.


47
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:32,296
With iOS 13, CarPlay now


48
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:33,826
supports irregularly shaped


49
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:34,496
displays.


50
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,556
First, your system defines a


51
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:37,186
view area.


52
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:39,246
This represents the rectangle


53
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:40,886
that CarPlay can draw a user


54
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:42,156
interface image into.


55
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:45,646
A view area can also contain a


56
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:46,326
safe area.


57
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:48,796
The safe area is also a


58
00:01:48,796 --> 00:01:50,626
rectangular area and must be a


59
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:51,896
subset of the view area.


60
00:01:53,276 --> 00:01:55,006
The safe area represents the


61
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:56,446
portion of the display that will


62
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:58,076
contain interactive content.


63
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:00,346
This includes user interface


64
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:01,536
elements such as buttons and


65
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:02,996
lists and important status


66
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:05,136
information like time, signal


67
00:02:05,136 --> 00:02:06,546
strength and route guidance


68
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:07,146
information.


69
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:09,295
iPhone will draw interactive


70
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,076
content within the boundaries of


71
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:11,786
the safe area.


72
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:15,036
Modern car displays can come in


73
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:16,786
many different shapes and sizes.


74
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:17,956
Displays themselves may be


75
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:19,736
non-rectangular or portions of


76
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:21,486
the display may be occluded by


77
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:22,196
other elements.


78
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:24,896
With iOS 13, CarPlay can use


79
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,476
safe areas to better support


80
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:28,296
non-rectangular shaped displays.


81
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:30,976
First, the system defines a view


82
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:31,316
area.


83
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:33,516
The view area rectangle in this


84
00:02:33,516 --> 00:02:34,586
case would be made up of the


85
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:36,216
widest and tallest points of the


86
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:36,736
display.


87
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:38,626
This allows the CarPlay image to


88
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,016
render to all parts of the


89
00:02:40,016 --> 00:02:40,546
display.


90
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,416
Then a safe area rectangle will


91
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,756
be declared for the part of the


92
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,756
display where a CarPlay UI is


93
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:48,496
guaranteed to be visible and


94
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:49,896
interactable to the user.


95
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,926
And that was our update on


96
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:54,566
irregularly shaped displays.


97
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:58,276
Next up, let's talk about second


98
00:02:58,276 --> 00:02:59,606
screen support in CarPlay.


99
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:02,866
Prior to iOS 13, iPhone provided


100
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:05,586
a single H.264 video screen to


101
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,126
display the CarPlay UI on the


102
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:08,386
center console display.


103
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:10,686
This provides a great way for


104
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:12,096
users to set a navigation


105
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:13,976
destination, interact with music


106
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:15,006
apps and more.


107
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:17,366
However, this limits the user's


108
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:18,486
CarPlay experience to the


109
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:19,676
vehicle's main display.


110
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:23,136
Many vehicles have rich displays


111
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,626
directly in front of the driver


112
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,226
to show important information in


113
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:27,216
the form of an instrument


114
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:27,586
cluster.


115
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:30,156
In iOS 13, we now support


116
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:33,116
multiple H.264 video streams to


117
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:34,636
display CarPlay content in the


118
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:36,026
vehicle's instrument cluster.


119
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:38,116
This is a great way to display


120
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:39,176
additional information from


121
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,946
CarPlay apps directly in the


122
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:41,796
instrument cluster.


123
00:03:43,896 --> 00:03:45,006
And different types of


124
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,216
information can be displayed in


125
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:47,146
different areas of the


126
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:48,866
instrument cluster using more


127
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:49,876
than one video stream.


128
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:53,806
In iOS 13, CarPlay will support


129
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:55,276
a maneuver instruction card


130
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,726
provided by Apple Maps, as well


131
00:03:57,726 --> 00:03:58,946
as a map view which can be


132
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:00,386
rendered in parallel with the


133
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:02,066
instruction card in two separate


134
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,016
video streams.


135
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:05,756
Each video stream will have an


136
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:07,576
independent night mode, allowing


137
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:09,086
the vehicle system to specify an


138
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:10,336
appearance mode for different


139
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:11,266
content types.


140
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,216
Also, the vehicle chooses what


141
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:15,886
type of content is shown in each


142
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:16,276
stream.


143
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:18,116
For instrument clusters, car


144
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:19,986
play will only draw the type of


145
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:21,136
content the vehicle has


146
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:21,636
selected.


147
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:24,336
But please note for heads-up


148
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:26,306
displays, information from iAP2


149
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:27,906
Route Guidance will continue to


150
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:28,466
be used.


151
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,606
So with this in mind, let's look


152
00:04:30,606 --> 00:04:31,896
at how to best utilize the


153
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,456
different available protocols to


154
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:35,026
integrate CarPlay into a vehicle


155
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:35,776
instrument cluster.


156
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:38,116
Users can be provided with


157
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,726
simple status information from


158
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,126
apps in CarPlay such as


159
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:43,026
navigation, audio and phone


160
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:43,456
calls.


161
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:46,396
Firstly, map or turn-by-turn


162
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:47,956
information provided as a video


163
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:49,426
from iPhone can be displayed.


164
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:51,726
Additional information about the


165
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:52,946
navigation route can also be


166
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:55,126
provided as metadata using the


167
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:56,986
iAP2 Route Guidance feature.


168
00:04:57,746 --> 00:05:00,266
This, like other iAP2 features,


169
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,706
requires the vehicle to draw the


170
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,786
metadata in its own native UI.


171
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,696
The currently playing track or


172
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,396
podcasts can be rendered using


173
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:09,596
iAP2 Now Playing along with any


174
00:05:09,596 --> 00:05:11,456
information about ongoing phone


175
00:05:11,456 --> 00:05:12,786
calls using the iAP2


176
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,006
Communications feature.


177
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:16,666
Control of those phone calls can


178
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,686
be supported using iAP2 Call


179
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,456
Controls, allowing the system to


180
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:22,036
offer specific user actions


181
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,726
during phone calls like mute,


182
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:26,786
swap call and end call.


183
00:05:28,856 --> 00:05:30,536
Displaying CarPlay content in


184
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:31,586
the instrument cluster is


185
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:32,636
another part of the vehicle


186
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:34,206
system that benefits from using


187
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:35,936
safe areas and view areas.


188
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,316
In this example, the view area


189
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:39,986
would be the rectangle between


190
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:41,376
and behind the virtual


191
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:42,106
tachometers.


192
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:43,976
While aesthetically it may be


193
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,856
desirable for CarPlay content to


194
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,296
fill this region, some of it


195
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:48,696
would be obscured by the virtual


196
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:49,396
tachometers.


197
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:51,476
So a safe area would be declared


198
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,866
in the area between the two


199
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,466
tachometers and CarPlay will


200
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,526
position the important


201
00:05:55,526 --> 00:05:56,736
information where it will be


202
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:57,716
visible to the user.


203
00:05:58,286 --> 00:06:00,856
And multiple streams can be set


204
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:02,116
up to display different types of


205
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:03,496
content from CarPlay within the


206
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,296
instrument cluster.


207
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:06,626
For example, the second stream


208
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:07,806
could be a map view and the


209
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:09,736
third stream an instruction


210
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:10,606
card.


211
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,216
Displaying content within a


212
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:13,806
virtual tachometer will also


213
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,706
make use of view areas and safe


214
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:16,186
areas.


215
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:18,196
The rectangle containing the


216
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:20,046
entire circle would be the view


217
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,666
area, and the rectangle


218
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,246
contained entirely within the


219
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:24,916
circle is the safe area.


220
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:27,706
Again, CarPlay will position the


221
00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:29,286
important information where it


222
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:30,476
will be visible to the user.


223
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:33,206
So that was our update on


224
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:34,666
support for second screens.


225
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,446
Now let's take a look at the


226
00:06:37,446 --> 00:06:38,836
last of our new features that


227
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:40,236
affects displays in CarPlay,


228
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:42,316
dynamic screen resizing.


229
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:45,606
Prior to iOS 13, the size of the


230
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,336
CarPlay image remained fixed


231
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:48,506
while the CarPlay session was


232
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:48,906
active.


233
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:51,606
Now the size of the CarPlay UI


234
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:53,086
can change on the fly at the


235
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,046
user's request by declaring


236
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:56,406
multiple view areas for that


237
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:56,866
display.


238
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,226
This is ideal for systems that


239
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,926
support configurable horizontal


240
00:07:00,926 --> 00:07:03,116
split screens as shown here, and


241
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:04,616
larger portrait screens that are


242
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:06,276
normally divided into distinct


243
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:07,846
context-specific regions.


244
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:10,016
CarPlay can provide an Always


245
00:07:10,016 --> 00:07:11,546
Available button for the user to


246
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:13,176
trigger a resize request from


247
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,476
within the CarPlay UI.


248
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:17,376
This is useful to show CarPlay


249
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:18,966
in a full-screen configuration


250
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,416
without reserving space in the


251
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,626
native UI for dedicated control


252
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:23,816
for the user to exit that


253
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:24,566
configuration.


254
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:28,236
Resizing is not only supported


255
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:29,626
on the center console display


256
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:30,796
but also on the instrument


257
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:31,486
cluster as well.


258
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:34,076
So let's use the instrument


259
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:35,176
cluster from the previous


260
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:36,556
section as an example of how


261
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,236
dynamic resizing could be used


262
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:38,816
in CarPlay.


263
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:41,436
Let's say this instrument


264
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:43,076
cluster offers the user a way to


265
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,616
move the virtual tachometers


266
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,476
into one of two preferred


267
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:47,156
positions.


268
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:50,116
For this to work well, the


269
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:51,406
CarPlay image needs to be able


270
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:52,776
to adjust its size based on


271
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:54,066
where the virtual tachometers


272
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:54,746
are positioned.


273
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:57,586
Multiple view areas can be


274
00:07:57,586 --> 00:07:59,016
declared for this display to


275
00:07:59,016 --> 00:07:59,706
make this happen.


276
00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:01,666
Let's declare the first view


277
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,686
area for the widest


278
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:04,426
configuration and include a safe


279
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:05,786
area as discussed earlier.


280
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:09,526
For the narrower configuration,


281
00:08:09,586 --> 00:08:11,236
a second view area would be used


282
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:12,936
with its own narrower safe area.


283
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,316
The vehicle system can also


284
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:16,956
specify how long the transition


285
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,246
between those configurations


286
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:19,666
should take, allowing the


287
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,236
CarPlay content to transition


288
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:22,966
sizes in the same timeframe.


289
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:25,026
Let's take a look at how this


290
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:26,566
transition would work.


291
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,486
The user starts in the wider


292
00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:30,956
configuration and uses some


293
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:32,806
native UI control, possibly a


294
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:34,056
steering wheel button, to begin


295
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:34,746
the transition.


296
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:37,976
During this three-second


297
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,466
transition, CarPlay is telling


298
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:40,826
the native system the size of


299
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:42,645
the encoded image in the H.264


300
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,196
frame, allowing the vehicle


301
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:45,306
system to synchronize the


302
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:46,656
position of its own tachometer


303
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:47,626
UI elements.


304
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,026
So in summary, dynamic resizing


305
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:52,706
is supported on center console


306
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,226
and instrument cluster displays.


307
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:56,966
A UI resize can be triggered by


308
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,316
the user either through the


309
00:08:58,316 --> 00:09:00,026
native UI or a button within the


310
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:00,846
CarPlay UI.


311
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:03,736
The vehicle system declares how


312
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:05,116
long transitions between view


313
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:05,886
areas should take.


314
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:09,256
And CarPlay provides an update


315
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:10,556
on how far the view area


316
00:09:10,556 --> 00:09:12,106
transition it is so the vehicle


317
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:13,116
system can synchronize


318
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:14,816
transition animations in its own


319
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:15,156
UI.


320
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:18,186
So that's all for our new


321
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:19,716
display-related features.


322
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:21,326
Thanks for listening so far.


323
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:23,096
Now over to Tanya for an update


324
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,216
on Siri in CarPlay.


325
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,226
>> Thanks, Tom.


326
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,656
My name is Tanya Kancheva and


327
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:30,656
I'll talk to you about enabling


328
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:32,396
Hey Siri support in future


329
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:33,046
vehicles.


330
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:35,756
So what do we mean when we talk


331
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:37,476
about supporting Hey Siri in


332
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:37,966
your car?


333
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:41,696
First, of course, the driver can


334
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,006
launch Siri completely


335
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:44,996
hands-free without needing to


336
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:46,886
press a button or take their


337
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:47,896
eyes off the road.


338
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,136
And since Hey Siri is detected


339
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:52,646
using the car's microphone,


340
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,436
iPhone can be out of sight, left


341
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:57,086
in a pocket or even in the


342
00:09:57,086 --> 00:09:57,436
trunk.


343
00:09:58,156 --> 00:09:59,846
Siri will still be available.


344
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:03,946
We also updated audio handling


345
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:05,856
so that activating Siri through


346
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,116
a button press is instantaneous.


347
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:10,666
Just hold the Siri button on the


348
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,426
steering wheel and say your


349
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:14,056
request without waiting for an


350
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,506
audible trigger to speak.


351
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:17,636
Siri will be back with your


352
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:18,906
answer immediately.


353
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:23,566
Lastly, we looked at how Siri


354
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:25,276
and Music interplay in the car


355
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:27,496
and enable the smoother and more


356
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:28,756
familiar experience.


357
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,936
Music continues to play in the


358
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:33,076
background while interacting


359
00:10:33,076 --> 00:10:33,626
with Siri.


360
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:39,166
Here is a system overview for


361
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,576
audio handling in CarPlay.


362
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,826
Some of the components should


363
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:44,516
already be familiar to you, but


364
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,276
let's go ahead and look into the


365
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:46,876
details.


366
00:10:48,216 --> 00:10:50,506
To support Hey Siri, the in-car


367
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:52,386
microphone needs to be always


368
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:55,336
active and undergo continuous


369
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:56,256
voice processing.


370
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,376
The echo cancellation module


371
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:01,256
runs all the time and removes


372
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:02,626
any audio playing through the


373
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:04,916
car's speakers as well as


374
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,386
reduces background driving


375
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:06,656
noise.


376
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:11,146
The process microphone data is


377
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:12,826
sent to an audio ring buffer


378
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:14,786
within the CarPlay communication


379
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:16,886
plug-in which holds a couple of


380
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,816
seconds of historical audio.


381
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:21,296
This buffer is stored within the


382
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:23,576
car until there is a trigger to


383
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:25,796
send it to iPhone.


384
00:11:26,026 --> 00:11:27,256
So what is this trigger?


385
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:30,126
In fact, there are two modules


386
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,886
which can lead to audio exchange


387
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:32,576
with iPhone.


388
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,306
Both constantly analyze the


389
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:36,716
process microphone data.


390
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,116
One can trigger when the drive


391
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,126
says Siri.


392
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:41,936
That's the keyword detector.


393
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:44,456
The other one triggers when the


394
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:45,836
drive starts talking.


395
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:47,556
That's the voice activity


396
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:48,016
detector.


397
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:51,196
Both detectors must be available


398
00:11:51,196 --> 00:11:53,646
in the car as iPhone determines


399
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,126
which one is used for a


400
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:56,306
particular scenario.


401
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,956
Now let's say the keyword


402
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:02,216
detector triggered so the car


403
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:03,936
notifies iPhone through the


404
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:05,066
communication plug-in.


405
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:09,176
iPhone opens a new audio stream


406
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,946
called Aux In, requesting some


407
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:13,756
historical audio data to be


408
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:14,186
sent.


409
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:18,366
The received audio is reanalyzed


410
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:20,886
by a voice trigger detector on


411
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,246
iPhone which verifies that the


412
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:24,706
user said, "Hey, Siri."


413
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,026
The second pass detector uses


414
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:29,916
offline keyword detection on


415
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,706
iPhone similar to how Hey Siri


416
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:34,606
is detected when the user is not


417
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:35,056
driving.


418
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:38,196
Only after the second pass


419
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:41,736
detector on iPhone triggers Siri


420
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:43,686
is activated to process the data


421
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:45,316
and respond to the user.


422
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:49,716
Now, let's look at how this


423
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:51,516
architecture is helping us


424
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:53,376
improve triggering Siri with a


425
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:54,246
button press.


426
00:12:54,636 --> 00:12:57,926
As we already saw, the mic, the


427
00:12:57,926 --> 00:13:00,276
ECNR unit and the audio ring


428
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:02,136
buffer are processing audio


429
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:04,026
within the car system all the


430
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:04,436
time.


431
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:08,686
Now the user presses the Siri


432
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:10,326
button on the steering wheel


433
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:13,416
that is the trigger for iPhone


434
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,336
to request audio data from the


435
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,176
time when the user pressed the


436
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:17,646
button.


437
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:20,076
Since this is the button press,


438
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:22,446
Siri activates immediately.


439
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:24,956
And as the buffered audio is


440
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:27,566
sent faster than real-time, Siri


441
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,366
can be ready with a response


442
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,056
right after the user stops


443
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:31,546
talking.


444
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:35,886
Okay, now that we have discussed


445
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:37,756
the three ways in which Siri can


446
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:40,536
trigger from the car through a


447
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:43,156
detected keyword, voice activity


448
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:45,596
or a button press, let's see


449
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,506
what happens when Siri is active


450
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,896
and helping the driver.


451
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,936
Typically, music will be playing


452
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:53,496
in the car.


453
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,136
In this case, let's say that


454
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,846
music is coming from iPhone.


455
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,366
The car will receive the audio,


456
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:02,366
mix it and play it through the


457
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:03,016
speakers.


458
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:05,696
In the past, when Siri started


459
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:08,126
in CarPlay, music had to stop


460
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:09,836
and there was a bit of silence


461
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:11,486
before Siri prompts played.


462
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:13,956
With this new architecture,


463
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:16,536
media playback is separated from


464
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:19,396
Siri prompts so the music can


465
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:20,776
keep playing in the background.


466
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,706
When Siri launches, an


467
00:14:23,706 --> 00:14:25,116
additional audio stream


468
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:27,556
dedicated to Siri output, Aux


469
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:29,296
Out, will be opened.


470
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:32,636
The car will then mix the two


471
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:35,036
streams, reduce the volume of


472
00:14:35,036 --> 00:14:37,366
the music as needed and play


473
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:39,496
Siri prompts quickly and without


474
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:40,586
big interruptions.


475
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,536
But please don't forget that in


476
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:47,016
addition to Siri prompts, there


477
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,276
might be active route guidance,


478
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:51,556
so the mixer has to be able to


479
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,816
mix three parallel audio streams


480
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:54,866
coming from iPhone.


481
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:57,676
All right.


482
00:14:58,226 --> 00:14:59,626
Now that we have gone through


483
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:00,936
the details of the audio


484
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:02,926
architecture, let's quickly


485
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:05,656
summarize what is needed within


486
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:06,716
the vehicle system.


487
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,046
First, a microphone which is


488
00:15:10,046 --> 00:15:11,766
always processing audio in your


489
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:12,256
system.


490
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:15,186
Then, an echo canceller and


491
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:17,136
noise reduction module to clean


492
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:18,396
up microphone input.


493
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:21,786
A detector that triggers when


494
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:23,006
the driver is talking.


495
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:26,676
A detector that triggers when


496
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,296
the Siri keyword is heard.


497
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:32,906
The ability to mix three audio


498
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:33,946
streams from CarPlay.


499
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,396
And that's how our update on Hey


500
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:38,816
Siri.


501
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:41,926
Thank you for your time.


502
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:44,376
