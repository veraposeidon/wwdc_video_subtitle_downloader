00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:08,846
>> Hello, I'm Tim Hatcher an


3
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:10,066
engineer on the WebKit Team.


4
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:11,886
I'm going to talk about


5
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,406
Supporting Dark Mode in Web


6
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:13,876
Content.


7
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:18,036
When macOS Mojave introduced


8
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:20,056
Dark Mode, users and developers


9
00:00:20,056 --> 00:00:21,926
naturally began to ask about web


10
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:22,766
content.


11
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:25,766
Over the decades web content has


12
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:27,166
traditionally been light in


13
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,356
color leading to a very bright


14
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:30,966
experience when mixed among


15
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:32,716
newly Dark Mode aware apps.


16
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,036
The WebKit team has been working


17
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,306
to standardize a way for


18
00:00:37,306 --> 00:00:39,416
developers to style web content


19
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,486
for Dark Mode, which I'm happy


20
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:43,026
to announce is available in


21
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:45,786
Safari 12.1 on macOS Mojave and


22
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,876
with iOS 13's system wide dark


23
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:53,266
appearance, you will see the


24
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:54,996
same Dark Mode styling for web


25
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:57,106
content in Safari for iOS.


26
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:01,116
Throughout this video I'll be


27
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:03,486
using Safari in my examples, but


28
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:04,566
this support is not just


29
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:05,706
available in Safari.


30
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:08,936
It is also available in mail and


31
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,806
in your app when showing content


32
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:11,636
in web views.


33
00:01:13,726 --> 00:01:15,056
There are three areas I want to


34
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:16,006
cover in this video.


35
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:18,826
One, general styling support for


36
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:19,836
Dark Mode on the web.


37
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:23,296
Two, some specific cases that


38
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:24,696
apply to email messages.


39
00:01:25,496 --> 00:01:27,146
And, three, tools you can use to


40
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:28,966
debug web content in Dark Mode.


41
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:32,266
Let's get started.


42
00:01:32,796 --> 00:01:35,986
I've been working on a new blog


43
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:37,526
to document some recent trips


44
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:38,896
I've taken around California.


45
00:01:40,956 --> 00:01:42,376
While designing the site to be


46
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:43,816
responsive for mobile and


47
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:45,976
desktop visitors, this would be


48
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:47,586
a good time to add support for


49
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:48,276
Dark Mode.


50
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:50,446
Dark mode can be viewed as a


51
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:52,026
progression of responsive web


52
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:54,646
design, another way to adapt to


53
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:56,746
the circumstances of the device.


54
00:01:57,606 --> 00:01:59,416
It is important to note that


55
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,336
Safari and WebKit will not auto


56
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:02,506
darken your content.


57
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:04,716
As the web developer, you are in


58
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:06,536
control of how your content will


59
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:08,756
appear to users using the dark


60
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:09,795
system appearance.


61
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:12,236
Let's take a look at how we can


62
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:14,846
transform this light page design


63
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:16,546
into a Dark Mode ready site.


64
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,866
The main way to signal that your


65
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,986
content supports Dark Mode is to


66
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:22,996
adopt the new color scheme style


67
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:24,716
property currently being


68
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:26,986
specified for inclusion in the


69
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:28,226
CSS standard.


70
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:31,016
Specifying the values light and


71
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,896
dark on the root element lets


72
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:34,416
the rendering engine known both


73
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,646
modes are supported by the


74
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:36,456
document.


75
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:39,046
This changes the default text


76
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:40,216
and background colors of the


77
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:42,386
page to match the current system


78
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:44,436
appearance, standard form


79
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:47,116
controls, scrollbars and other


80
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:49,236
named system colors also change


81
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,376
their look automatically.


82
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:53,246
Let's take a look at how adding


83
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:54,606
that property to my blog


84
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:55,556
affected things.


85
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:59,096
You can see the background color


86
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,126
changed from white to black and


87
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:02,676
most of my text completely


88
00:03:02,676 --> 00:03:03,816
disappeared into the black


89
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,796
background; that was not what I


90
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:06,576
was expecting.


91
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,746
Let's take a look at some of the


92
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:11,036
style rules for this page to see


93
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:11,846
what is happening.


94
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,526
Here are the main style rules


95
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:16,726
for the affected areas of the


96
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:17,306
page.


97
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,646
For the text that disappeared


98
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:22,266
the black was being set as the


99
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,456
text color on the body.


100
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:25,686
I also have a dark gray text


101
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:27,406
color for the level 1 headings,


102
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:28,976
which doesn't have a high enough


103
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,226
contrast with the black


104
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:30,826
background.


105
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:33,276
By default, the text color of


106
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:34,656
the body will be black and light


107
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:34,966
mode.


108
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:37,956
Since that is what I wanted on


109
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:39,786
this page I can just delete the


110
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,506
color property override from my


111
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:42,416
style sheet.


112
00:03:42,986 --> 00:03:44,366
Now that I'm using the color


113
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:46,086
scheme property, the default


114
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:47,556
text and background color will


115
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:49,426
both automatically change to the


116
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:50,656
Dark Mode values.


117
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:53,526
For the other colors in my style


118
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,566
sheet that I want to keep, I can


119
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,336
use something called CSS custom


120
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:58,976
properties otherwise known as


121
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:01,206
CSS variables to centrally


122
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:02,886
define them for use throughout


123
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:04,146
my site style sheets.


124
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:06,846
Using CSS variables makes it


125
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,746
very easy to later adapt the


126
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:09,976
style sheet for Dark Mode.


127
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:11,976
Let's see how that will work.


128
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:16,016
We simply take the color values


129
00:04:16,086 --> 00:04:17,875
and move them to a central place


130
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:19,606
like the root element rule we


131
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,125
added for the color scheme


132
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:21,776
earlier.


133
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,846
For these colors we define a


134
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:27,826
variable name signified by a


135
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:29,356
double hyphen prefix.


136
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:33,086
Now we can return to the


137
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:35,136
original style rules where I am


138
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:36,816
still using the static color


139
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:40,366
values and change them to use


140
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:41,596
the variables we defined


141
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,046
referencing them by name using


142
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:45,876
the VAR function which looks


143
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:46,466
like this.


144
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:48,906
This style sheet is now ready to


145
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:50,706
support a dark color scheme.


146
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:54,586
Like responsive design


147
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,366
breakpoints for different device


148
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,336
widths, we can use a media query


149
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:00,436
to conditionalize for Dark Mode.


150
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:02,726
Specifically, if the user


151
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:04,486
currently prefers a dark color


152
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:04,996
scheme.


153
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:10,106
We can override the same CSS


154
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:11,636
variables we defined earlier for


155
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:13,996
light mode with Dark Mode


156
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:15,436
appropriate color values.


157
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:17,186
Now let's take a look at what


158
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,556
the page looks like with these


159
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:19,456
changes applied.


160
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:22,436
We go from this where we only


161
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:23,976
added the color scheme property


162
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,936
to this where the text and


163
00:05:26,936 --> 00:05:29,196
header colors properly adapt to


164
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,026
the dark appearance, but what


165
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:31,926
about images?


166
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:33,866
Like the hero picture here of


167
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:34,836
the Mojave Desert.


168
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:37,996
The Mojave Desert image is


169
00:05:37,996 --> 00:05:39,456
included by an image element


170
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,266
that is sourcing a JPEG on my


171
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:41,746
server.


172
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:44,116
We can easily adapt this code


173
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:46,026
using another responsive design


174
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:46,556
technique.


175
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:49,086
Specifically, the picture


176
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:50,696
element, which is a great way to


177
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:52,336
source multiple versions of an


178
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:54,456
image based on various device


179
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:56,796
characteristics using the same


180
00:05:56,796 --> 00:05:57,736
media queries.


181
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:00,316
Here I specify an alternate


182
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:01,976
image of the Mojave Desert at


183
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:04,206
night using the same media query


184
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:05,496
that was used earlier for the


185
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:07,256
Dark Mode colors I can


186
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:09,256
conditionally load a night image


187
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:11,096
for users that prefer a dark


188
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:12,096
color scheme.


189
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:15,076
So we go from this where I was


190
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:16,576
using one image for both color


191
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,406
schemes to this where the desert


192
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:20,986
image is adapted to the dark


193
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:23,336
appearance and now the site is


194
00:06:23,336 --> 00:06:26,356
ready for both dark and light


195
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:27,196
appearances.


196
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:31,216
To recap you want to use the new


197
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:32,886
color scheme property to declare


198
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:34,346
support for light and Dark


199
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:34,846
Modes.


200
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:36,646
This informs the rendering


201
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,516
engine what color schemes your


202
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:40,866
content was designed for so it


203
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:43,116
can adapt the default colors and


204
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:44,326
controls to match.


205
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,836
When the default colors are not


206
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:49,916
enough, use the


207
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,556
prefers-color-scheme media query


208
00:06:51,556 --> 00:06:52,766
for custom values.


209
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:55,656
You can use the same media query


210
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:57,216
along with other responsive


211
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,426
images in the picture element


212
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:02,116
for Dark Mode ready sources and


213
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:04,806
consider using CSS variables


214
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:06,646
when adopting color schemes.


215
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:08,406
It will be easier to maintain


216
00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:10,356
both appearance modes across


217
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:10,976
your content.


218
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:13,796
That brings us to Dark Mode and


219
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:14,746
email messages.


220
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:18,156
Just like mail in macOS Mohave


221
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:20,156
simple email messages composed


222
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:22,786
directly in mail on iOS 13 are


223
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:24,936
ready to go in both light and


224
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:27,196
dark appearances even if they


225
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,306
include in-line image


226
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:29,736
attachments like you see here.


227
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,356
This is the case because of


228
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:33,606
mail's auto darkening


229
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:35,936
transformations that get applied


230
00:07:36,226 --> 00:07:38,056
to these simple email messages.


231
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:42,246
However, if you are an email


232
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:43,866
template designer creating


233
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:45,546
designs for a campaign that


234
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:47,476
includes remotely loaded images,


235
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:49,376
you will need to adopt the same


236
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:50,966
styling techniques I covered


237
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,606
earlier for web content.


238
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:54,506
Without adopting the color


239
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:56,076
scheme property mail will


240
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,786
display your email message in


241
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:59,366
the light appearance and will


242
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,246
not employ any auto darkening


243
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:03,166
transformations that simple


244
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,516
email messages receive.


245
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:07,706
Here is the same email message


246
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:10,266
with Dark Mode styling including


247
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:11,736
the color scheme declaration.


248
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:13,946
It is now perfectly adapted to


249
00:08:13,946 --> 00:08:15,356
the dark system appearance.


250
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:19,296
To recap simple email messages


251
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:20,996
will auto darken even if they


252
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:22,106
include in-line image


253
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:24,556
attachments and rich email


254
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:27,256
messages with remote images like


255
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,226
custom email marketing campaigns


256
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,086
will use the light color scheme


257
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:31,846
by default.


258
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,405
You can declare support for the


259
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:36,106
dark color scheme in your


260
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:38,476
marketing email messages and use


261
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,376
the media query for custom color


262
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,876
and image customizations.


263
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:45,666
Now let's talk about tools to


264
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,916
debug Dark Mode content


265
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,676
specifically Web Inspector.


266
00:08:49,806 --> 00:08:51,386
In macOS, we added the dark


267
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,306
appearance to Web Inspector when


268
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:54,806
your system is in Dark Mode.


269
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,186
This was a very popular request


270
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:58,806
from web developers, and I'm


271
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,426
very happy we have it now.


272
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:03,296
Not only did we add the dark


273
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:04,796
appearance there are a couple


274
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:06,496
tools to help you debug your own


275
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:07,776
content in Dark Mode.


276
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:10,626
The first is a new color scheme


277
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:12,616
toggle in the elements tab that


278
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:14,276
will change the page appearance


279
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:16,136
without requiring you to toggle


280
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:17,696
the entire system appearance


281
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:18,496
every time.


282
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,096
So if you like using Dark Mode,


283
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:23,166
you can quickly test how your


284
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,256
pages will look in the light


285
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:26,726
appearance with this button.


286
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:31,426
Like before the style sidebar


287
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:33,146
shows any rules that match for


288
00:09:33,146 --> 00:09:35,526
the selected element including


289
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:36,716
any media queries.


290
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,476
In this case, you can see the


291
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:41,176
prefers color scheme media query


292
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:43,696
definitions of color variables


293
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:45,196
on the WebKit.org site.


294
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:48,016
And that is Dark Mode and Web


295
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:48,656
Inspector.


296
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,346
Check out some of the other


297
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:52,116
Safari and WebKit sessions for


298
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:53,836
details about other great new


299
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:55,836
features in Web Inspector for


300
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:57,026
Safari 13.


301
00:09:58,136 --> 00:09:59,656
In summary, remember that web


302
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:01,376
pages and rich email messages


303
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:02,896
need to opt into Dark Mode.


304
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,346
Safari and WebKit will not auto


305
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:06,556
darken your content.


306
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,276
For simple email messages you


307
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,196
don't have to worry.


308
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:12,196
Mail darkens them to match the


309
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,046
system appearance automatically


310
00:10:14,826 --> 00:10:16,066
and now you can use Web


311
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,716
Inspector to test your content


312
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:19,536
in light and Dark Modes with the


313
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,016
new color scheme toggle in the


314
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:21,876
elements tab.


315
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:24,126
I look forward to seeing what


316
00:10:24,126 --> 00:10:25,496
you will do with this support


317
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:27,476
and how your sites and apps will


318
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:29,286
look in Dark Mode on Mac and


319
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:29,946
iOS.
