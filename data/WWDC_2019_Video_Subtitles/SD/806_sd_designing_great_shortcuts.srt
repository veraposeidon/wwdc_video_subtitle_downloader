3
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:11,836
>> Hi. I'm Jay.


4
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:13,456
I'm a designer on the Siri and


5
00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:14,186
Shortcuts team.


6
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:15,746
And today, we'll be talking


7
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:17,036
about how to design great


8
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:18,786
shortcuts for your apps.


9
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:21,426
We're going to cover three main


10
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:22,836
topics today.


11
00:00:23,836 --> 00:00:25,126
First, I'll talk about looking


12
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,306
at all the use cases of your


13
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,936
app, and deciding which ones


14
00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:29,206
might make sense as shortcuts.


15
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:32,345
Then, I'll talk about how to


16
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:33,056
make these shortcuts


17
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,336
discoverable in your apps.


18
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:37,956
And, finally, I'll walk through


19
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,426
how to design a great Siri


20
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:40,406
experience for the new


21
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:41,686
interactive capabilities of


22
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:43,296
shortcuts in iOS 13.


23
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:46,526
Now, stepping back for a moment,


24
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:48,276
shortcuts in general are a great


25
00:00:48,276 --> 00:00:49,086
way to bring your app's


26
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:50,356
functionality in front of more


27
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:52,316
users in more places in the OS.


28
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:53,836
So, let's take a look at the


29
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:54,696
places where your apps'


30
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:56,316
shortcuts can appear to get a


31
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:57,536
feel for what might be useful.


32
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,516
If you tell the system when the


33
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:02,786
user does something in your app,


34
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:04,156
the system can automatically


35
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:05,416
suggest a shortcut when it


36
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,726
predicts the user will next want


37
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:07,456
to do that action.


38
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:09,386
And, these shortcuts can appear


39
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:10,846
in lock screen and search.


40
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:13,046
Here, this shortcut lets you


41
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:14,466
quickly start a guided workout,


42
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:15,826
you usually do at this time of


43
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:15,916
day.


44
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:20,286
If a user adds a shortcut to


45
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:21,926
Siri, by assigning it a custom


46
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:23,566
phrase, they can invoke it at


47
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:24,966
any time with their voice.


48
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,086
Here, the shortcut lets them


49
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,116
order their usual dinner.


50
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:30,306
In one quick confirmation step,


51
00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:31,496
the user can get some great


52
00:01:31,496 --> 00:01:32,886
Mediterranean food.


53
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:36,646
Another great use for shortcuts


54
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:38,116
with Siri is getting information


55
00:01:38,116 --> 00:01:39,246
hands- and eyes-free.


56
00:01:40,216 --> 00:01:42,106
So, to your HomePod, if you have


57
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:43,526
a transit app shortcut, you can


58
00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:45,626
say, Hey Siri, bus schedule.


59
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:47,516
And, Siri will speak out the bus


60
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:48,686
schedule information from your


61
00:01:48,686 --> 00:01:49,000
app.


62
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:53,996
And, you can also incorporate


63
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,516
your app's functionality as part


64
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:56,696
of a multi-step shortcut.


65
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:58,596
Here, the shortcut handles your


66
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,366
evening routine, ordering soup


67
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:01,626
in time for your arrival home,


68
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,326
playing your favorite music for


69
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:04,756
your car ride, and showing the


70
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:06,486
fastest directions.


71
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:09,836
So, looking at these examples,


72
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:11,266
we can see that shortcuts are


73
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,486
great for accelerating


74
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:14,316
frequently used, useful actions


75
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:15,046
your app can do.


76
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:17,446
Presenting information at a


77
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:20,296
glance, or with your voice, or


78
00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:21,746
as building blocks for powerful


79
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:23,526
multi-step shortcuts, where your


80
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:24,986
app can work alongside others.


81
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:28,656
We introduced Siri shortcut


82
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,556
suggestions in iOS 12, so look


83
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:32,366
back at past sessions for more


84
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:33,746
information on how to develop


85
00:02:33,746 --> 00:02:34,726
great shortcuts to be


86
00:02:34,726 --> 00:02:36,336
automatically suggested on lock


87
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:37,226
screen and search.


88
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:39,526
Today, I'm going to focus on how


89
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,626
to make shortcuts to take


90
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:41,826
advantage of the new Siri


91
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,496
capabilities in iOS 13.


92
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:45,416
We're going to walk through how


93
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,756
to prioritize the features in


94
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:47,966
your app that might make for


95
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,026
good Siri shortcuts.


96
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:51,816
To do that, let's take a look at


97
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:52,846
one of our favorite apps,


98
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:54,526
SoupChef, which lets you order a


99
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:56,256
wide variety of soups for pickup


100
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:56,846
or delivery.


101
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:58,846
Let's walk through the design


102
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,226
process for making a SoupChef


103
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:01,286
shortcut.


104
00:03:04,046 --> 00:03:05,206
List out all the things that


105
00:03:05,206 --> 00:03:05,886
your app can do.


106
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:08,086
When doing so, start thinking


107
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,276
about things that a user might


108
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:10,426
want to repeat with their voice.


109
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:13,146
So, with SoupChef, you can do


110
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:14,526
things like browse the menu of


111
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:14,846
soups.


112
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:16,256
Order a soup.


113
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:17,816
Check your order status, or view


114
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:18,466
past orders.


115
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:20,426
Let's take a look at some of


116
00:03:20,426 --> 00:03:20,976
these features one by one.


117
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:26,876
Browsing a menu is a very visual


118
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:28,046
activity that requires a lot of


119
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:29,366
structured information that


120
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:30,576
won't translate well to voice.


121
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:32,846
It requires scrolling, tapping,


122
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,726
and navigating.


123
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:35,756
And, it provides information


124
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:37,146
that isn't likely to change from


125
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:38,566
invocation to invocation.


126
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,626
And, it's more of a means to an


127
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:43,136
end, and not a valuable action


128
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:44,026
in and of itself.


129
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:46,836
So, this might not be a good


130
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:48,466
candidate for a shortcut.


131
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:52,236
Checking an order status could


132
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:53,366
be something a user might want


133
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,446
to do with their voice, getting


134
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:55,736
a quick summary of information


135
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,556
from Siri.


136
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:58,846
But, it's also only applicable


137
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:00,296
for a narrow window of time,


138
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:01,426
right after a user's ordered


139
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:01,826
something.


140
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:04,316
So, this is something that you


141
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:05,726
could consider allowing users to


142
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:07,546
turn into a shortcut, but maybe


143
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:08,956
only if your delivery periods


144
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:10,076
are long, or have multiple


145
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:10,496
phases.


146
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:15,196
And viewing past orders is nice


147
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:16,245
to have, but I don't know about


148
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:17,586
you, I'm not regularly checking


149
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:17,805
that.


150
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:18,956
So, not a great shortcut.


151
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:24,606
Ordering a soup is a very


152
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:25,486
valuable activity.


153
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:27,226
In fact, the most important


154
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,056
activity of your app.


155
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:29,356
And, you can imagine it being


156
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:30,856
repeatable if a user has a


157
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:31,966
favorite soup.


158
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:33,876
So, let's call this a pretty


159
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:35,016
good candidate for a shortcut.


160
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,776
So, in summary, a great use for


161
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:40,926
shortcuts will be something that


162
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:42,406
is valuable, or interesting to


163
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:42,736
repeat.


164
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:45,346
Doable with your voice by not


165
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:46,886
relying on visuals or tapping.


166
00:04:47,436 --> 00:04:49,436
And, invokable in many contexts.


167
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:50,766
So, the shortcut isn't just


168
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:52,096
applicable during a small window


169
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,146
of time.


170
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,526
So, now that we know that we


171
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:57,036
want users to be able to reorder


172
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:59,016
soup with shortcuts, let's take


173
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,216
a look at how we might make that


174
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,206
discoverable in your app.


175
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:03,176
We provide a standard Add to


176
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,606
Siri button, that makes it easy


177
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:06,096
for users to see what features


178
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:07,566
in your app can be turned into a


179
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,226
Siri shortcut.


180
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:09,966
But use it thoughtfully.


181
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:13,156
Don't do this, where you put an


182
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:14,826
Add to Siri button on every item


183
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:15,556
on your main menu.


184
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:17,506
As beautiful as the button is on


185
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:19,146
its own, repeating it like this


186
00:05:19,146 --> 00:05:20,386
looks ugly, and it's not really


187
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:20,976
relevant here.


188
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:22,806
The user's probably just trying


189
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:23,756
to make an order in the first


190
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,066
place.


191
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:25,366
And, these buttons are getting


192
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:25,766
in the way.


193
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:28,196
And, these could be items that


194
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:29,336
the user has never ordered


195
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:29,786
before.


196
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:31,146
So, it doesn't make sense to


197
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:32,516
suggest reordering them just


198
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:33,226
yet.


199
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,976
Instead, look at opportunities


200
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:36,906
where you can present it in a


201
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:38,316
focused UI, where you have a


202
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:39,636
clear signal that a user might


203
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:40,526
want to repeat something.


204
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:43,686
For example, it might be better


205
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:44,936
to show an Add to Siri button


206
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,346
right after a user has ordered


207
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:46,706
something.


208
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,716
The logic being, if a user's


209
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:49,796
found it good enough to order


210
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,516
before, the user's more likely


211
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:52,466
to want to order it again.


212
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:54,226
And, you're not interrupting


213
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:55,696
anything a user's trying to do.


214
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:56,806
They just finished their order,


215
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,056
so this is a good opportunity.


216
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:01,676
To make the Add to Siri button


217
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:02,846
fit in to your app's visual


218
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:05,176
appearance even better, you can


219
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:06,896
now customize the corner radius


220
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:07,426
of the button.


221
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:11,026
And, you can have its appearance


222
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:12,246
automatically change based on


223
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,366
the user's light or dark mode


224
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:13,716
preference.


225
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:16,936
Now, if you've tried really


226
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:18,696
hard, like really hard, and the


227
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:20,226
button's visual style doesn't


228
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:22,006
fit into your app, you can make


229
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:22,696
your own button.


230
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:23,886
But, you should replicate all of


231
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:25,236
Add to Siri's functionality.


232
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:29,276
The standard Add to Siri button


233
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:30,926
shows the user's shortcut phrase


234
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:31,606
once configured.


235
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:32,966
And, this is a good way to


236
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:34,326
remind the user what they can


237
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,046
say to run the shortcut.


238
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:38,666
Tapping on it will reveal a


239
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,926
standard sheet which allows the


240
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:40,726
user to edit or delete the


241
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:40,976
shortcut.


242
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:46,796
If you want a centralized place


243
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:47,926
in your app where you list all


244
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:49,376
your shortcuts, it might be too


245
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,516
much to have the Add to Siri


246
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:52,336
button on every row, like we saw


247
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:52,716
earlier.


248
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,506
So, instead, you're free to use


249
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:56,746
standard UIKit elements.


250
00:06:58,056 --> 00:06:59,536
Just make sure that when a user


251
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:01,196
sets up a shortcut, just like


252
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:03,556
the Add to Siri button, you show


253
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,756
the phrase the user has set up


254
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:05,426
the shortcut with.


255
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:07,676
Tapping on it should also reveal


256
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:08,816
the sheet, where you can edit or


257
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:09,606
delete the shortcut.


258
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:12,966
So, let's get back to users


259
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,006
setting up the shortcut for the


260
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:15,156
first time.


261
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:19,166
Once the user taps on the Add to


262
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,496
Siri button, they'll see the Add


263
00:07:20,496 --> 00:07:21,886
to Siri sheet, where the user


264
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:23,386
can choose what phrase to use to


265
00:07:23,386 --> 00:07:24,436
invoke the shortcut.


266
00:07:25,106 --> 00:07:27,696
In iOS 13, your app can pre-fill


267
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:29,356
a shortcut of your own choosing.


268
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:31,146
And, most users will probably


269
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:32,596
just assign this phrase if you


270
00:07:32,596 --> 00:07:34,176
provide it, so make sure you


271
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:36,906
provide a good default.


272
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:38,686
Order Soup is a good, short,


273
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:40,136
memorable phrase in this case,


274
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,666
that the user might want to


275
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:42,916
genuinely want to use for the


276
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:43,286
shortcut.


277
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,276
Let's take a look at another


278
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:46,316
example, and take a break from


279
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:49,496
soup for a while.


280
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:50,626
Checking the bus schedule.


281
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:52,456
While this might look like a


282
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:53,796
sensible phrase, given how


283
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:55,396
relatively short it is, there


284
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:56,616
are plenty of opportunities for


285
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:58,116
the user to forget words, or


286
00:07:58,116 --> 00:07:59,016
switch words around.


287
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:00,946
They might try to say, Look up


288
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:01,736
the bus schedule.


289
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:03,546
Or, the bus schedule for the 35.


290
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:04,696
Or, just drop the "the"


291
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:05,416
altogether.


292
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:08,286
While Siri will do its best to


293
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,026
match these to the phrase, users


294
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:11,216
can still get pretty creative


295
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:12,306
when trying to recall longer


296
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:12,716
phrases.


297
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:15,056
So, this might not be the best


298
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:15,776
suggested phrase.


299
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:19,666
Instead, keep it short, at


300
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,016
around three or fewer words.


301
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:22,916
Try limiting it to a proper


302
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,546
noun, or just a verb and an


303
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:24,986
object.


304
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:26,766
This reduces the chance that


305
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:28,246
users will mix up word order, or


306
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:28,976
use different prepositions.


307
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:33,486
OK.


308
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:34,506
A user wants to set up a


309
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:35,635
shortcut for ordering tomato


310
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:35,936
soup.


311
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:38,056
But, what if the user wants the


312
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,056
shortcut to do something


313
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:40,275
slightly different every time,


314
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:41,736
like order a different soup.


315
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:44,936
In iOS 13, users can tap on the


316
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:46,716
cell under the Do area, and


317
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:49,176
customize how much information


318
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:50,506
is pre-baked into the shortcut


319
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:52,276
by simply tapping on one of the


320
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:53,626
fields.


321
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:55,586
The user can choose to leave


322
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:57,186
certain fields blank, like the


323
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:58,226
type of soup itself.


324
00:08:58,556 --> 00:09:00,876
And, when they do that, Siri can


325
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:02,336
ask for this missing information


326
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:03,416
on your app's behalf.


327
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:06,046
Now, ideally a shortcut has very


328
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:06,986
minimal interaction.


329
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:08,746
After all, it should accelerate


330
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:09,856
people to something that they do


331
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:10,386
frequently.


332
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:13,296
So, when you present the ad to


333
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:14,846
Siri sheet, the action should


334
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,686
include as much information as


335
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:18,156
possible, to run the shortcut


336
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:19,326
with just one or two steps.


337
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:21,616
In this case, this shortcut goes


338
00:09:21,616 --> 00:09:22,646
straight to the confirmation


339
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:23,806
screen, because everything is


340
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:24,666
already specified.


341
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:27,406
But, what happens when a user


342
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:28,506
chooses to leave everything


343
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:30,346
blank, and wants to specify all


344
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:31,686
of the details of their order in


345
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:32,786
an interaction with Siri?


346
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:36,746
Let's take a look at how we


347
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:38,266
might design a complete ordering


348
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:38,976
soup interaction with Siri.


349
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:44,906
Think about what information you


350
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:45,936
need to know in order to carry


351
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:47,096
out a soup request.


352
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:48,696
Like, the kind of soup it is.


353
00:09:49,386 --> 00:09:50,296
Whether you're ordering for


354
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:51,126
delivery or pick up?


355
00:09:51,126 --> 00:09:52,256
And, if you're ordering for


356
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:53,606
delivery, what location are you


357
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:54,646
delivering to, and if you're


358
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:55,886
ordering for pickup, what you're


359
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,556
picking up from.


360
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,376
To start thinking about the


361
00:09:58,376 --> 00:09:59,536
order and manner in which you


362
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:00,806
might collect this information,


363
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:02,016
you should think of your app's


364
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:03,556
interaction as a conversation


365
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:05,596
between your user and Siri.


366
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:08,526
And, one way to visualize this


367
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,396
conversation is with a script,


368
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:11,756
which is useful for quickly


369
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:13,386
jotting down one conversational


370
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:14,326
path.


371
00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:17,246
Of course, there isn't just one


372
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:18,216
path you can go down.


373
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:19,666
You should write down all of the


374
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,756
possible paths in which the


375
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:21,706
conversation might go.


376
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:24,246
For example, a user could say an


377
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:25,546
option that's not supported by


378
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:25,886
your app.


379
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:27,866
In that case, Siri should


380
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,276
probably indicate that to the


381
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:29,956
user.


382
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,586
Now, handing over a book of


383
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:34,086
scripts might get unwieldy as a


384
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:36,406
design specification, so, at the


385
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:37,346
end of the process, you'll


386
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,506
probably end up with something


387
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:40,556
more like this; a flow diagram


388
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,776
that covers all the possible


389
00:10:41,776 --> 00:10:43,116
states and transitions within a


390
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:43,766
conversation.


391
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:46,736
Now, there are specific ways


392
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:48,326
that Siri can present choices,


393
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:50,226
and handle user input, so let's


394
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:51,036
dive straight into the


395
00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:52,816
conversational patterns you have


396
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:53,616
at your disposal.


397
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:57,286
The first pattern that you have


398
00:10:57,426 --> 00:10:58,046
is the prompt.


399
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:00,226
This is the most open-ended way


400
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,686
you can collect a value from the


401
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:01,986
user.


402
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:04,196
You should write your prompt as


403
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,716
a question, and phrase it in a


404
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:07,326
way that sets the user up for a


405
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:10,726
well-formed response.


406
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,066
When a user says something that


407
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,086
might mean multiple things to


408
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,716
your app, you can present an


409
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,926
option list which allows the


410
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,476
user to specify which one they


411
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:18,716
meant.


412
00:11:19,536 --> 00:11:20,866
This is called a disambiguation


413
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:21,176
prompt.


414
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:24,086
You can minimize disambiguation


415
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:25,536
prompts, which add another step


416
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:27,516
to your conversation, by


417
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:28,826
presenting an option list up


418
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:29,136
front.


419
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,336
Notice that the user has said


420
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:32,846
their shortcut phrase, Order


421
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:34,366
Soup, and went straight to the


422
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:34,716
list.


423
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:36,996
You should use this instead of a


424
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,506
free-form prompt if there's a


425
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:39,846
constrained list of options to


426
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:40,306
choose from.


427
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:42,686
Make sure your prompt dialog


428
00:11:42,686 --> 00:11:44,146
encourages choosing from a list.


429
00:11:44,596 --> 00:11:45,546
Questions that start with the


430
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:46,886
word "which" work really well


431
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:46,976
here.


432
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,476
When using s shortcut without a


433
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:54,156
display, Siri will read out


434
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:54,706
options.


435
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:57,026
Like on AirPods, on HomePod, or


436
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:57,966
when the user says Hey Siri.


437
00:12:02,486 --> 00:12:04,226
And, Siri will read these out as


438
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:05,076
you would provide them in your


439
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:05,566
visual UI.


440
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,786
But, you can imagine that this


441
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:09,246
could get verbose, especially if


442
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:10,136
a lot of the options are


443
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:10,536
similar.


444
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:13,136
To improve this experience, you


445
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:15,136
can separately specify how Siri


446
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:16,806
reads your options out loud, by


447
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:18,276
providing pronunciation hits


448
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:19,746
that you can add to each option.


449
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:22,136
Let's take a look at a slightly


450
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:22,826
different example.


451
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:24,786
The user has asked for Noodle


452
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,316
Soup.


453
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:26,146
And, there are two kinds.


454
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:28,026
Instead of saying Beef Noodle


455
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:29,716
Soup, or Veggie Noodle Soup, you


456
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,196
might want to just say Beef or


457
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:31,556
Veggie?


458
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:33,776
So, consider only reading out


459
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:35,276
the details that differentiate


460
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:37,806
between each item.


461
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:39,936
Now, conversations are a two-way


462
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:41,266
street, so you also have to


463
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,736
account for what the user might


464
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:43,056
say.


465
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:44,986
And, the user may not use the


466
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:46,216
exact words that you've labeled


467
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:47,516
the option with.


468
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,746
To handle natural variations in


469
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:52,876
responses, for each option, you


470
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:53,836
should provide Siri with


471
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:55,226
synonyms that mean the same


472
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:56,186
thing as that option.


473
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,126
So, when the user just says


474
00:12:58,216 --> 00:12:59,696
Beef, it'll match to Beef Noodle


475
00:12:59,696 --> 00:12:59,966
Soup.


476
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:02,536
When coming up with these


477
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:04,026
synonyms, you should also keep


478
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:05,436
in mind that the phrasing of


479
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:06,386
your question impacts the way


480
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:06,976
the user may respond.


481
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:12,956
So, if you have a more casual


482
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:14,406
way of describing the options,


483
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:15,766
like the one with meat, or the


484
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:17,586
vegetarian one, you should make


485
00:13:17,586 --> 00:13:19,496
sure that you recognize the user


486
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:20,646
repeating that kind of phrasing


487
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:20,976
back to Siri.


488
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,476
If a user provides a response


489
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:28,536
that you want to be extra sure


490
00:13:28,536 --> 00:13:29,566
about, like a value of


491
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:31,066
particularly high consequence,


492
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:32,816
you can provide a parameter


493
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:33,806
confirmation prompt.


494
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:35,876
But, use this judiciously, and


495
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,276
only for truly exceptional


496
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:38,866
cases, as this slows the user


497
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:39,500
down.


498
00:13:42,216 --> 00:13:43,866
One alternative way of using a


499
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,786
parameter confirmation prompt is


500
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:47,276
if your app has its own logic


501
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:48,486
for predicting what a user might


502
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:48,756
want.


503
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:50,836
You can present your best guess


504
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,126
to the user, and they can either


505
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:53,906
confirm it, in which case, yay,


506
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:54,656
they don't have to provide


507
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:55,496
additional details.


508
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:57,756
Or, they can deny it, in which


509
00:13:57,756 --> 00:13:59,256
case you can fall back to a more


510
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,036
open-ended prompt.


511
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:02,206
If you can guess what the user


512
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:03,696
wants, it's a great way of


513
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:04,686
making your shortcut interaction


514
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:04,976
even faster.


515
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,476
At the end of the flow, consider


516
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,106
using a confirmation prompt that


517
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:14,406
applies to the action as a


518
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:16,056
whole, particularly if the


519
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,226
action itself is of high


520
00:14:17,226 --> 00:14:17,756
consequence.


521
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:20,386
In this step, you can confirm


522
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:21,946
all of the details of the action


523
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:23,276
about to be performed that's


524
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:24,616
relevant to the decision, like


525
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,316
price and delivery time in a


526
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:27,826
visual user interface that you


527
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:28,776
can fully customize.


528
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,686
Note that for actions in the


529
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:32,056
ordering category, the system


530
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,556
requires the user to confirm.


531
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,036
So, make sure, if you fall under


532
00:14:35,036 --> 00:14:36,556
that category, you provide a


533
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:37,686
great confirmation experience.


534
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:41,846
But, remember that your shortcut


535
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:43,506
can be run by a user not looking


536
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:44,786
at a screen, so you should


537
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:46,286
provide dialog for voice-only


538
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:46,886
experiences.


539
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:48,926
In this case, we provide


540
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:50,526
additional dialog to help the


541
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:51,316
user make a choice.


542
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:54,806
The purpose of this additional


543
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,666
dialog is to provide information


544
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:57,706
that can't otherwise be


545
00:14:57,706 --> 00:14:59,026
displayed in a visual user


546
00:14:59,026 --> 00:14:59,406
interface.


547
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,696
So, think of this extra dialog


548
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:03,536
as a spoken equivalent of the


549
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,116
most important information you


550
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:05,796
would otherwise draw in a


551
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:05,976
display.


552
00:15:10,046 --> 00:15:11,606
Finally, your response.


553
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:13,896
Siri will indicate the status of


554
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:14,366
the action.


555
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,436
You can provide a visual UI


556
00:15:16,436 --> 00:15:17,606
summary here to describe


557
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:19,196
additional details, like who's


558
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:19,916
going to be delivering your


559
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,586
soup, and the latest estimated


560
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:22,296
delivery time.


561
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,816
Notice that we just say, "OK.


562
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:25,966
Ordered" here, because we're


563
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,206
using a display to show the


564
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:28,146
additional information.


565
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:30,656
For voice-only experiences, you


566
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:31,716
should specify a more


567
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:32,626
descriptive dialog.


568
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:36,426
And, again, think of this extra


569
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:38,276
dialog as a spoken equivalent of


570
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:39,826
the most important information


571
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,166
of the response UI you would


572
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:41,886
draw on a display.


573
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:46,676
When you're thinking about your


574
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:47,936
confirmation and response


575
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:49,526
dialog, you should keep in mind


576
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:50,466
that you'll need to select a


577
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:51,806
category for your shortcut.


578
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:53,726
When you define your shortcut in


579
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:55,546
Xcode, select the category that


580
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:56,606
is the closet match to your


581
00:15:56,606 --> 00:15:57,656
shortcut's functionality.


582
00:15:58,386 --> 00:15:59,406
In our SoupChef case, it's


583
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:00,156
pretty clear that the order


584
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:00,976
category fits the bill.


585
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:07,246
In confirmation prompts, Siri


586
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:08,186
will provide the question


587
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:09,566
itself, based on the category


588
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:10,056
you select.


589
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:12,346
So, don't include a question as


590
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:13,696
part of the confirmation dialog


591
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:14,676
you customize, highlighted in


592
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:14,966
white here.


593
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,036
In response dialog, Siri will


594
00:16:21,036 --> 00:16:22,146
provide a status that is


595
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:23,296
appropriate to the category.


596
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:25,486
Your custom dialog gets appended


597
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,826
to the end of the dialog Siri


598
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:27,246
provides.


599
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,106
Voice interactions should also


600
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:33,716
be as robust as possible, to


601
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:36,126
avoid forcing the user to open


602
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:37,616
the app to continue manually.


603
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:40,156
For example, you should provide


604
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:41,566
clear error messages if a


605
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:42,986
parameter value is invalid.


606
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:44,916
Siri will then automatically


607
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,066
re-prompt for that value.


608
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:48,626
You should also avoid getting


609
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:49,826
yourself into this scenario in


610
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:50,386
the first place.


611
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:51,936
If you're presenting option


612
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:53,216
lists, make sure you don't


613
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:54,326
present any options that you


614
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:56,436
know to be invalid at runtime.


615
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:00,156
You should also consider


616
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:01,656
opportunities to dig users out


617
00:17:01,656 --> 00:17:02,086
of holes.


618
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,306
Users may include values like


619
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:05,326
delivery location in their


620
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:06,856
shortcut, since it's usually


621
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:08,286
just their home, and so they get


622
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:09,126
used to not saying their


623
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:10,715
delivery location to Siri.


624
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:12,096
One day they might use the


625
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:13,146
shortcut when they're far from


626
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:13,455
home.


627
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:15,066
You should check for that case,


628
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,046
and prompt for a different


629
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:16,455
location.


630
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:19,215
And, for whatever reason, users


631
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:20,286
might want to continue running


632
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:21,576
the shortcut in your app.


633
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:23,876
They can tap anywhere in your UI


634
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,675
to do that.


635
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:26,806
So, when you present UI, keep in


636
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:28,606
mind that the whole area is one


637
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:30,346
big button that opens your app.


638
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:31,806
So, don't draw elements that


639
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:33,276
look individually interactable.


640
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:34,046
They can't be.


641
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:37,126
Make sure that when a user does


642
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:39,076
tap this area, your app opens up


643
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:40,676
to the right place, with all of


644
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:41,966
the information the user has


645
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:43,346
already provided up until that


646
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:46,726
point, filled out in the app.


647
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,946
And, finally, we encourage you


648
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:50,206
to take time when writing


649
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:50,696
dialog.


650
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:52,316
It's not something that you can


651
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:53,866
just do a quick pass at, to have


652
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,076
something to demo, and then


653
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:55,926
leave in your final shipping


654
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:56,296
product.


655
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,856
Remember, that in a voice


656
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:00,476
interaction, language is the


657
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:01,216
user interface.


658
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:03,126
So, you should treat the words


659
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:04,856
in your Siri interaction with as


660
00:18:04,856 --> 00:18:06,856
much respect and care as you do


661
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:09,396
the pixels in your app.


662
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:10,596
With that said, let's walk


663
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:11,186
through a small set of


664
00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:11,656
guidelines.


665
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,066
Don't be overly polite or inject


666
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:16,926
too much personality.


667
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:18,666
Users who want to customize


668
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,866
their soup will hear this


669
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,386
non-essential dialog every time


670
00:18:21,386 --> 00:18:23,126
they run this shortcut, which


671
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:24,416
will get irritating.


672
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:27,936
When in doubt, test it.


673
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:29,766
Listen to Siri speak your


674
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:30,246
dialog.


675
00:18:30,706 --> 00:18:32,146
How does your dialog feel to you


676
00:18:32,146 --> 00:18:33,396
after the third time hearing it?


677
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:34,666
What about the 10th?


678
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:37,186
If parts of it feel annoying, it


679
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,596
might be a good signal that you


680
00:18:38,596 --> 00:18:40,346
should reduce the verbosity of


681
00:18:40,876 --> 00:18:42,976
your dialog.


682
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:44,566
Dialog should be concise,


683
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:46,506
neutral, and communicate the


684
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:47,556
type of response that you're


685
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:48,016
expecting.


686
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:52,646
Don't include your app name in


687
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:53,276
your dialog.


688
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,006
Your app will already be


689
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:57,506
attributed, visually, via your


690
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:58,946
confirmation and response UI,


691
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:01,056
and occasionally via Siri's own


692
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:01,556
additions.


693
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:03,906
So, just take your name out.


694
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:04,956
Don't worry, your brand is safe.


695
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,116
Similarly, you shouldn't include


696
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,516
your user's name in your dialog.


697
00:19:14,126 --> 00:19:15,396
Siri may at times speak the


698
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:17,146
user's name on HomePod to verify


699
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:17,736
their identity.


700
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:19,706
If your app does so as well, it


701
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:20,856
might sound repetitive and


702
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:21,256
annoying.


703
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:25,426
So, just take your name out.


704
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:28,946
Avoid using first-person


705
00:19:28,946 --> 00:19:30,576
pronouns, since Siri isn't


706
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,086
performing the action, your app


707
00:19:32,086 --> 00:19:32,306
is.


708
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:34,346
It's a subtle distinction, but


709
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:35,226
it's an important one.


710
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:37,736
By saying "I" or "we" in Siri's


711
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:39,676
voice, users might think Siri


712
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,166
has a better understanding of


713
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,316
your app's capabilities than it


714
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:43,766
does, and might try to take


715
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:45,476
follow-up actions that your app


716
00:19:45,546 --> 00:19:46,826
and Siri can't understand.


717
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:51,526
Instead, present options


718
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:53,276
neutrally, using words like


719
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:53,756
"here" or "there are a few


720
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:53,976
options."


721
00:19:58,346 --> 00:20:01,296
So, what have we learned today?


722
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:04,386
Shortcuts are meant to elevate


723
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:05,466
your app's most repeatable


724
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:05,836
features.


725
00:20:06,576 --> 00:20:09,106
You should use the Add to Siri


726
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:10,956
button to make sure users know


727
00:20:11,196 --> 00:20:12,026
what they can turn into a


728
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:14,046
shortcut from inside your app.


729
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:16,636
You should make your Siri


730
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:18,546
interactions logical, concise,


731
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:19,286
and robust.


732
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:22,576
And, you should take extra care


733
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:23,566
when writing dialog.


734
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:24,976
Thank you.
