00:00:07,506 --> 00:00:09,326
>> Hi. My name is Jared McGann.


3
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:10,586
I'm an engineering manager in


4
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:11,286
watchOS.


5
00:00:11,876 --> 00:00:14,556
In watchOS 5, Apple released the


6
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,175
new Infograph clock faces with


7
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:17,466
graphic complications.


8
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:20,526
In watchOS 6, we've enhanced


9
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:22,226
graphic complications with a new


10
00:00:22,226 --> 00:00:22,816
tinted mode.


11
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:26,136
Any clock face with graphic


12
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:27,616
complications supports tinted


13
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:28,456
complications.


14
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,606
Here's some more examples from


15
00:00:30,606 --> 00:00:32,086
our new watch faces in watchOS


16
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:32,516
6.


17
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:34,976
These graphic complications are


18
00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:36,546
composed of three data types;


19
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:38,406
gauges, text, and images.


20
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:40,626
The system alters the appearance


21
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:42,076
of each into contexts.


22
00:00:42,296 --> 00:00:43,576
Let's walk through each one.


23
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:46,876
In tinted context, gauges are


24
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:48,266
displayed as a solid color


25
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:49,596
rather than a color gradient.


26
00:00:51,546 --> 00:00:52,816
The color of the gauge is


27
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:54,306
determined by the system, as


28
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:55,626
informed by the customer's color


29
00:00:55,626 --> 00:00:56,156
selection.


30
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:58,406
If your complication relies on


31
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,796
color to communicate information


32
00:00:59,796 --> 00:01:01,256
within the gauge, you may need


33
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:02,616
to reconsider how you display


34
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:03,726
that information in your


35
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:04,396
complication.


36
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:08,286
Text is also displayed with a


37
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:10,056
single color in tinted contexts.


38
00:01:10,556 --> 00:01:11,816
Again, the color is determined


39
00:01:11,816 --> 00:01:12,876
by the system, based on the


40
00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:14,016
customer's color choice.


41
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:16,576
Multicolor text providers are


42
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,626
reduced to a single color, as


43
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:19,996
seen in the activity rings


44
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:20,746
complication.


45
00:01:23,036 --> 00:01:25,116
Lastly, images are desaturated


46
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:26,866
by default in tinted contexts,


47
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:29,536
but we also have new API to


48
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:31,086
provide alternate images in this


49
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:31,366
mode.


50
00:01:33,736 --> 00:01:35,356
Before we dive into the new API,


51
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:36,966
I'd like to take a step back and


52
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:38,056
talk about data providers


53
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:38,596
generally.


54
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:40,886
ClockKit includes a number of


55
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:41,756
data providers for


56
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:42,646
complications.


57
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:44,786
These providers manage the data


58
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:46,066
you supply to ClockKit for


59
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,446
display within a complication.


60
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:51,276
Let's take a look at the full


61
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:52,456
color image provider.


62
00:01:54,236 --> 00:01:56,056
The image property specifies a


63
00:01:56,056 --> 00:01:57,666
full-color image to be displayed


64
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:58,666
by a complication.


65
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:01,486
Then there's an accessibility


66
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:02,846
label property, which is a


67
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:04,496
succinct label that identifies


68
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:05,596
the purpose of the image.


69
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,596
So how do you provide an


70
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:08,866
alternate image for tinted


71
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:09,556
contexts?


72
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:12,436
In watchOS 6 there's a new


73
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:13,146
property in


74
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:15,646
CLKFullColorImageProvider called


75
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:16,616
tintedImageProvider.


76
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:18,866
It's an optional property where


77
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,316
you can provide a separate image


78
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:21,966
for tinted contexts if you don't


79
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,266
want the full color image to be


80
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:23,986
desaturated.


81
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:26,466
This property is of the type


82
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:28,196
CLKImageProvider.


83
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:30,266
We chose this class because it


84
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:31,406
allows you to provide both


85
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:32,926
one-piece and two-piece template


86
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:34,516
images for tinted contexts.


87
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,506
Let's take a closer look at


88
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:40,426
CLKImageProvider, which has been


89
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,726
around since watchOS 2.


90
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:44,316
The first thing to note is that


91
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:46,436
CLKFullColorImageProvider is not


92
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:48,356
derived from CLKImageProvider.


93
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,516
These are two distinct classes.


94
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:53,596
This class, CLKImageProvider,


95
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,316
manages template images for


96
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:56,536
display in a complication.


97
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:58,326
The clock face displaying the


98
00:02:58,326 --> 00:02:59,686
complication determines how to


99
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:01,396
display the image and what tint


100
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:02,146
color to apply.


101
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,606
The first property is one-piece


102
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:06,956
image, which is a single


103
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:07,806
template image.


104
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:09,386
This is the only required


105
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:10,186
property.


106
00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:12,906
Next up is tint color.


107
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:14,946
In some classic complication


108
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,806
contexts, this color is applied


109
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:17,906
to the template image within a


110
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:18,676
complication.


111
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:21,396
In graphic complications, tint


112
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:22,906
color is ignored because color


113
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:24,516
is determined by the system as


114
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:25,766
influenced by the customer's


115
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:26,556
color selection.


116
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,266
Then, there are two-piece


117
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,996
images, which are composed of


118
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:32,576
the two-piece image background


119
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,366
and two-piece image foreground


120
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:34,926
properties.


121
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:39,636
Classic complications use


122
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,306
two-piece images in multicolor


123
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:42,836
contexts, as seen here.


124
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:45,026
Graphic complications use


125
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,656
two-piece images in some tinted


126
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:47,406
contexts.


127
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:49,606
When applicable, two-piece


128
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:51,066
images take priority over


129
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,016
one-piece images.


130
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:54,856
A two-piece image consists of a


131
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:56,456
foreground image layered on top


132
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:57,466
of a background image.


133
00:03:58,146 --> 00:03:59,906
Both images are template images.


134
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:01,966
In classic complications, the


135
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:02,976
color and the tint color


136
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,416
property is applied to the


137
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,026
background image and white to


138
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:06,936
the foreground image.


139
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,536
In tinted graphic complications,


140
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:11,306
as previously mentioned, tint


141
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:12,156
color is ignored.


142
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:13,936
The system will determine the


143
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:15,686
foreground and background colors


144
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,236
as informed by the customer's


145
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:17,995
color selection.


146
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:21,776
Let's walk through a few


147
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,536
scenarios for displaying images


148
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:24,656
within a tinted graphic


149
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:25,316
complication.


150
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,706
The first is for the full color


151
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:29,276
image to appear desaturated in


152
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:30,236
tinted contexts.


153
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,036
Here, we see the full color


154
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:33,936
image desaturated, more or less


155
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:35,066
gray scale on the right.


156
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:39,236
To achieve this in code, merely


157
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:39,906
initialize a


158
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,796
CLKFullColorImageProvider


159
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:43,696
without a tintedImageProvider,


160
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:44,676
as seen here.


161
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:46,816
When the tintedImageProvider


162
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:48,656
property is nil, the system


163
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,316
displays a desaturated version


164
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:51,426
of the full color image.


165
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:55,406
In other scenarios, you may want


166
00:04:55,406 --> 00:04:56,666
to display an alternate template


167
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,126
image in tinted contexts.


168
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:00,086
Perhaps your full color image


169
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:01,816
doesn't desaturate well, or


170
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:02,686
maybe you're concerned about a


171
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:03,796
logo being displayed in


172
00:05:03,796 --> 00:05:04,816
undesirable colors.


173
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,586
To do this in code, create a


174
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:10,406
CLKImageProvider with the


175
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:11,866
desired one-piece template


176
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:12,266
image.


177
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:14,086
Then supply that in the


178
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:16,086
CLKFullColorImageProvider


179
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:18,096
initializer alongside the full


180
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:18,796
color image.


181
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:21,456
In full color context, ClockKit


182
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:22,716
will utilize the full color


183
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:23,106
image.


184
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:24,946
In tinted contexts, the


185
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:25,896
one-piece image from the


186
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:27,356
CLKImageProvider will be


187
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:27,996
utilized.


188
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:32,226
It's worth noting that you can


189
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:33,936
also provide the same full color


190
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:34,646
image within the


191
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:36,596
tintedImageProvider, and that


192
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:37,926
image will be templatized


193
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:39,076
instead of desaturated.


194
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,246
We use this technique in many of


195
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:42,266
the standard watchOS


196
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,126
complications.


197
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,846
Lastly, you may want to provide


198
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:49,176
an alternate two-piece image in


199
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:50,146
tinted contexts.


200
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:54,776
To achieve this, create a


201
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:56,626
CLKImageProvider with both


202
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:58,246
one-piece and two-piece template


203
00:05:58,246 --> 00:05:58,776
images.


204
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,866
Then supply this object in the


205
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,896
CLKFullColorImageProvider


206
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,006
initializer alongside the full


207
00:06:05,006 --> 00:06:05,836
color image.


208
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:08,256
In tinted contexts, ClockKit


209
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:09,866
will determine if the one-piece


210
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,136
or two-piece image should be


211
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:11,766
utilized.


212
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:15,126
Here's a chart from the Human


213
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,296
Interface Guidelines with


214
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:17,746
various graphic complication


215
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:18,266
layouts.


216
00:06:20,876 --> 00:06:22,076
And here you can see the same


217
00:06:22,076 --> 00:06:23,616
layouts in a tinted environment.


218
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:28,076
Remember that ClockKit will


219
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:28,986
alter the appearance of


220
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:30,246
complications in tinted


221
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:30,986
contexts.


222
00:06:31,996 --> 00:06:33,416
Tint color in tinted graphic


223
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,926
complications is determined by


224
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:36,656
the system, as informed by the


225
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:37,936
customer's color selection.


226
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:40,546
And lastly, we've supplied new


227
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:42,166
API that allows you to provide


228
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,726
alternate template images to be


229
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,436
displayed in tinted contexts.


230
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:49,916
If you're new to complications


231
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:50,926
