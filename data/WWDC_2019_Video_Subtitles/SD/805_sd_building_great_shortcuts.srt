00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:14,256
>> Hello. My name is Ian and I


4
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:15,816
am an engineer on the Shortcuts


5
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:16,046
Team.


6
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:18,056
Today I'm going to talk to you


7
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:19,696
about how users can build their


8
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:21,546
own shortcuts and how you can


9
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:22,896
ensure that they have the best


10
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:23,996
possible experience.


11
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:27,006
I'm going to cover three topics


12
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:27,266
today.


13
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:30,136
First, intents from your app can


14
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:31,866
now be editable by the user as


15
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:32,336
actions.


16
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:34,216
I'm going to walk you through


17
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:35,616
the parts of an action and show


18
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:37,046
how users can configure them


19
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:38,266
inside of their Shortcuts.


20
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,286
You've built great Shortcuts and


21
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:42,246
we want to make sure that you


22
00:00:42,246 --> 00:00:43,216
can get them in front of your


23
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:44,076
users, as well.


24
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:45,896
I'm going to talk about some


25
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:47,286
ways that you can showcase the


26
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:48,836
Shortcuts from your app using


27
00:00:48,836 --> 00:00:50,736
Add to Siri and other APIs.


28
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:53,266
And later on, we're going to


29
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:55,026
build a multistep shortcut and


30
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:56,596
make actions that work great


31
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:58,326
with others by using input and


32
00:00:58,326 --> 00:00:58,746
output.


33
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,176
Let's get started.


34
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:03,766
I have an app called Soup Chef.


35
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:05,546
And as you know, it's a super


36
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:07,296
way to order clam chowder or


37
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:09,006
tomato soup for delivery and


38
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:09,576
pickup.


39
00:01:10,316 --> 00:01:11,876
And Soup Chef has made an intent


40
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:13,446
for ordering soup.


41
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,926
So, here's that inside of the


42
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:17,596
Shortcuts Editor, where actions


43
00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:18,246
are configured.


44
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,276
Every action can have parameters


45
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:22,806
that can be edited by the user.


46
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:24,426
And these parameters were


47
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:25,756
defined inside of the Intent


48
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:26,616
definition file.


49
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:29,676
Until the user enters a value,


50
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:31,476
parameters show the display


51
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:31,716
name.


52
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:33,626
And because this display name


53
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,436
can sometimes be shown as a


54
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:37,916
title in configuration UI, make


55
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:39,386
sure that the display name is


56
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:40,506
always capitalized.


57
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:43,306
The parameter summary is a


58
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:44,426
sentence that's shown to the


59
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:46,046
user that describes what the


60
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:47,506
shortcut will do when it's run.


61
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:49,626
Summaries should read like a


62
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:51,306
sentence and start with a verb.


63
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:53,276
There's no need to write the


64
00:01:53,276 --> 00:01:54,816
name of your app in the summary


65
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:56,476
because it will be displayed at


66
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:58,056
the top of the action alongside


67
00:01:58,056 --> 00:01:58,956
your app's icon.


68
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:01,836
Try to keep the summary short


69
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:03,506
and only include the parameters


70
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:04,746
that must be filled out for the


71
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:06,166
action to be functional.


72
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:08,386
And whichever parameters you


73
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:09,826
don't include the summary will


74
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:11,076
be displayed underneath Show


75
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:13,236
More which the user can expand


76
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:14,616
while editing to modify the


77
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:15,806
values in the remaining


78
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:16,516
parameters.


79
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:19,226
Parameter summaries are defined


80
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:20,526
in the Shortcuts app section in


81
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:22,086
the Intent editor Xcode.


82
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:24,836
Soup Chef has multiple different


83
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:25,446
summaries.


84
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:27,156
One for ordering pickup and the


85
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:28,366
other for ordering delivery.


86
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:31,326
So, as the user changes between


87
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:32,716
pickup and delivery inside of


88
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:34,216
the action, the parameter


89
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:36,326
summary will update based on the


90
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,966
different values that the user


91
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:39,026
has entered.


92
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:43,456
So, your app knows best about


93
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:45,026
what the user does and when.


94
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,016
So, we think the most relevant


95
00:02:47,046 --> 00:02:48,816
place to create shortcuts is


96
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:49,826
right inside of your app.


97
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:52,516
Here we are inside of Soup Chef


98
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:53,766
and someone just ordered some


99
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:54,986
tomato soup with cheese.


100
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:57,136
And this is a great time to


101
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,516
present an Add to Siri button


102
00:02:58,516 --> 00:02:59,976
because the user just performed


103
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:01,136
an action that they're very


104
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,036
likely to repeat.


105
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,836
So, to do that, Soup Chef placed


106
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,196
the order information into an


107
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:08,086
intent and then, placed the Add


108
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,436
to Siri button into the UI.


109
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:12,176
When the user taps on that


110
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:13,546
button, the app lets them create


111
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:15,046
a shortcut by showing the Add to


112
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:16,116
Siri View Controller.


113
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:18,656
The API to do this has not


114
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,816
changed since iOS 12 but this


115
00:03:20,816 --> 00:03:22,166
year, we've expanded what users


116
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,286
can do inside of the View


117
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:23,776
Controller.


118
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:25,656
So, let's look at what's new.


119
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:28,756
First, and instead of having to


120
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:30,176
say the phrase to save the


121
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,916
shortcut, users can now just


122
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:33,366
type it or use dictation.


123
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:36,506
Your app should be prefilling


124
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:37,616
this value by setting the


125
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,266
suggestedInvocationPhrase


126
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,566
property of your intent.


127
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:42,906
Try to keep this phrase short


128
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:44,336
and descriptive about the kind


129
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:45,456
of action that the user just


130
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:46,026
did.


131
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:47,726
And because the user will be


132
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,656
able to say this to Siri, it


133
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:51,406
should also be easy to speak and


134
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:51,896
remember.


135
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:55,376
Underneath that is the Do


136
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:56,556
section, which will show the


137
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:58,026
user a preview of what this


138
00:03:58,026 --> 00:03:59,386
shortcut will do when it's run.


139
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:01,596
Make sure to put as much


140
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:03,286
information as possible into the


141
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,676
intent about what the user just


142
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:05,046
did.


143
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:06,646
This will ensure that your app


144
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:08,746
can order the soup again without


145
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:10,266
having to ask too many follow-up


146
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:10,686
questions.


147
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:14,196
And if you've made your intent


148
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:16,026
configurable, the user can tap


149
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:17,565
on this, customize the shortcut,


150
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:18,896
and change the values that were


151
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:20,505
prefilled by, by you.


152
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:23,286
And once the user is done, they


153
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:24,836
will tap the Add to Siri button


154
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:27,156
and return back to your app.


155
00:04:27,156 --> 00:04:28,376
And later on, they can go into


156
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:29,836
the Shortcuts app where they can


157
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,516
view, edit, and run the shortcut


158
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:32,526
that they've made.


159
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,496
So, now let's take a look at


160
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:35,896
some places in the Shortcuts app


161
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:37,076
where you can make your


162
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:39,006
shortcuts discoverable, as well.


163
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:41,986
Many first-time users will start


164
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:43,576
off in the right-most tab which


165
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:44,266
is the Gallery.


166
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:45,896
Here is where we suggest


167
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:47,056
prebuilt shortcuts.


168
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,136
In iOS 13, we added a new


169
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:51,806
section to the Gallery and it


170
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:53,536
has suggested shortcuts from the


171
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:54,906
apps that are frequently used on


172
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:55,566
your device.


173
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:57,796
Now, your app's suggested


174
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,246
shortcuts have the possibility


175
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:00,606
of being prominently featured in


176
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,066
the Gallery depending on how


177
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:03,596
frequently the user interacts


178
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:05,466
with your app.


179
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:06,896
Your app can influence the


180
00:05:06,896 --> 00:05:08,246
suggestions that are displayed


181
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:09,726
in the Gallery in two different


182
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:09,966
ways.


183
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:12,866
First, you can explicitly set a


184
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:15,326
list of suggested shortcuts and


185
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:16,056
you can use the


186
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,566
INVoiceShortcutCenter to do


187
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:17,786
this.


188
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,356
You can update this as often as


189
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:21,726
you'd like as you learn more


190
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,076
about your user's habits and


191
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:23,616
preferences.


192
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:26,666
And we also populate this list


193
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:28,526
with recent or frequently used


194
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:30,036
actions that the user has done


195
00:05:30,036 --> 00:05:31,696
inside of your app.


196
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:32,926
Now, how does the Shortcuts app


197
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:34,336
know what the user does inside


198
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,136
of your app?


199
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:36,476
In previous years, we've


200
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:37,876
introduced the concept of


201
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:38,516
Donation.


202
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:41,116
Now, Donation allows you to tell


203
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:42,396
the system about things that the


204
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:44,386
user does so that the system can


205
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,966
later suggest them at a relevant


206
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:46,316
time.


207
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:49,226
You can create a, you can donate


208
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:51,886
by creating an INInteraction and


209
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,206
putting a filled out intent


210
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:54,576
about what the user just did


211
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:55,076
into there.


212
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:57,526
And then, later call the Donate


213
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:57,936
method.


214
00:05:59,256 --> 00:06:00,976
Not only does Donate allow your


215
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:02,096
shortcuts to appear in the


216
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,836
Gallery, but it also enables


217
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,636
private on-device Siri


218
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:07,176
suggestions in places like the


219
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:09,106
Lock Screen or Spotlight Search.


220
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:11,406
If you'd like to know more


221
00:06:11,406 --> 00:06:12,366
information about how


222
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:14,136
suggestions from Donations work


223
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:16,206
across the system, I encourage


224
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:17,746
that you watch our talks from


225
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:19,866
WWDC 2018.


226
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:22,606
Now, another time that users


227
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:24,026
might be creating and


228
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:25,586
discovering your shortcuts is


229
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,696
when building a new shortcut


230
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:27,646
inside of the app.


231
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:30,536
You'll see all of the possible


232
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:32,176
actions that can be added into


233
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:33,326
the shortcut in the Shortcuts


234
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:33,676
editor.


235
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:35,976
There's categories across the


236
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:37,866
top which contain hundreds of


237
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:39,386
built-in actions for things like


238
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,306
playing media, adding reminders,


239
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:42,976
and also scripting actions like


240
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:44,226
Loops and If statements.


241
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:48,086
Next, is a list of suggested


242
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:48,656
actions.


243
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:50,216
And these suggestions are based


244
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:52,386
also on device usage which


245
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:53,416
includes actions from


246
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,336
third-party apps.


247
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:56,846
Since I order soup a lot, Soup


248
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:58,116
Chef's action is right here at


249
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:58,866
the top.


250
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:01,536
So, how did Soup Chef get all of


251
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:03,426
these soup options to show up?


252
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,216
Well, there were two easy steps


253
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:06,046
to get this to work.


254
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:08,726
The first thing is to select


255
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:10,166
which of the parameters is the


256
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,056
key parameter.


257
00:07:12,276 --> 00:07:13,616
Your key parameter should be the


258
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:15,306
one that's most identifiable to


259
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:15,756
the user.


260
00:07:16,296 --> 00:07:17,776
And Soup Chef picked the soup


261
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:19,256
type as the parameter because


262
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:20,936
that's the most useful to the


263
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:22,676
user, more than quantity or


264
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,196
toppings.


265
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:26,516
And the second step is to Donate


266
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:27,976
every time the user performs


267
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:29,286
that action inside of your app,


268
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:32,656
if you're already donating via


269
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:34,726
the INVoiceShortcutCenter or via


270
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:36,206
INInteraction, then there's no


271
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,566
additional work required by your


272
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:37,896
app.


273
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:39,936
As long as your donation has a


274
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:41,296
value set for that key


275
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:43,176
parameter, we can show it inside


276
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:43,916
of suggestions.


277
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:47,166
Also, don't forget to include an


278
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,486
image for your key parameter


279
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:49,316
when donating.


280
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:51,016
If you don't provide an image,


281
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:52,436
then your app's icon will be


282
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:53,836
displayed in the list, instead.


283
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:56,416
And additionally, if you're


284
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,726
looking for a list of all of the


285
00:07:57,726 --> 00:07:59,106
actions from your app that's


286
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,736
donated or not, you can tap on


287
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:03,096
the app's section to see them


288
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:03,266
all.


289
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:06,346
Now, let's switch gears and


290
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:07,756
build a shortcut with a set of


291
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:09,326
actions that work great together


292
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:11,276
by using input and output.


293
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:13,846
I have another app called


294
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:14,566
StickyNote.


295
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:16,116
And StickyNote's a notetaking


296
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,796
app where I write down things


297
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:18,646
that I need to do.


298
00:08:19,956 --> 00:08:21,256
StickyNote has a whole bunch of


299
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:21,766
actions.


300
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:23,326
And most importantly, it has an


301
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:24,816
action where I can search for


302
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:25,676
notes by name.


303
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,466
And then, once a note is found,


304
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,886
there are other actions that can


305
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:32,275
manipulate that note such as


306
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:33,956
inserting text into the note or


307
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:35,106
deleting it.


308
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,616
In iOS 13, we now allow actions


309
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,216
from your apps to output


310
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:41,905
information for others to use.


311
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,966
So, the Find StickyNote action


312
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:46,206
can output a StickyNote with an


313
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:48,616
identifier, name, content, and


314
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:49,606
the last date that it was


315
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:50,116
modified.


316
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:53,216
I want to be able to chain two


317
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,796
shortcuts together and find a


318
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,286
note and then, add information


319
00:08:57,346 --> 00:08:58,126
into that note.


320
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:00,206
So, the note would be the output


321
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,986
of the first action and I'm


322
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:03,346
passing it as input to the


323
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:03,706
second.


324
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:06,166
So, let's take a look at how to


325
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,706
set up your action to produce


326
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:07,956
output.


327
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:12,616
First, we'll click on the plus


328
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:14,376
button at the bottom left to add


329
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:15,776
a new type representing what a


330
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:16,736
StickyNote is.


331
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:19,896
Types already have an identifier


332
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:20,836
and the Display Name.


333
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:23,406
But the note has content and a


334
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:24,716
date that it was last modified.


335
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:25,696
So, we'll add those as


336
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:27,546
properties so the user can


337
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:29,006
access all of that information.


338
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:32,286
Next, we'll select the response.


339
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:34,076
And the response is the object


340
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:35,626
representing the result of the


341
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:35,916
intent.


342
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,916
We will add a note property,


343
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:40,546
selecting the new type that we


344
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,066
just made.


345
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:43,696
And finally, we'll select that


346
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:45,386
property from the Output


347
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:45,906
dropdown.


348
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,476
So, if your response has


349
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:49,886
multiple properties, you need to


350
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:51,086
pick a single one from that


351
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:52,186
Output dropdown.


352
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:53,596
And this lets you control what


353
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,256
information other actions can


354
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:55,626
see.


355
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,576
So, now that our action has


356
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:01,296
output, I can add one action and


357
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:02,846
after the other and select the


358
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:04,486
found note as the note that I


359
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:07,196
want to add text to.


360
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:08,986
But for actions to work really


361
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:10,356
great together, it would be nice


362
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:11,936
if the note could automatically


363
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:13,206
be filled in to the second


364
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:14,586
action, so I don't have to


365
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:16,126
select it from the first every


366
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:16,796
single time.


367
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:19,766
So, if you need your actions to


368
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:21,756
work great together and fill


369
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:23,526
output from one into the input


370
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:25,006
of another, you need to select


371
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,436
one of your parameters as the


372
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:27,176
input parameter.


373
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:29,406
Here we are looking at that Add


374
00:10:29,516 --> 00:10:30,536
Text to Note action.


375
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:33,046
And we'll select the note as the


376
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:33,966
input parameter.


377
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,236
So, now when I add the second


378
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,616
action, the Add Text to Note


379
00:10:38,616 --> 00:10:40,326
action, that note is already


380
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:41,986
filled in to the note parameter


381
00:10:42,356 --> 00:10:43,296
from the first action.


382
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,566
So, adding inputs and outputs


383
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:47,416
allows users to create multiple


384
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,946
step shortcuts using your


385
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:50,086
actions that work great


386
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:50,456
together.


387
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,206
So, let's take a look at the


388
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:54,276
things that we covered today.


389
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,486
First, we walked through the


390
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:58,196
components of a Shortcuts action


391
00:10:58,456 --> 00:11:00,066
and how users can configure one.


392
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:02,776
Next, we looked at the various


393
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:05,046
ways that users can discover


394
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:05,756
your actions.


395
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:07,276
And we started inside of your


396
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:08,736
app using the Add to Siri


397
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:09,816
experience.


398
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:12,016
And next, we walked through the


399
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:13,636
Gallery and the Editor inside of


400
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:14,916
the Shortcuts app and talked


401
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,196
about how to make your actions


402
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,646
discoverable there, as well.


403
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:20,076
And finally, we explored how to


404
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:21,336
make your actions work great


405
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:23,056
together taking input and


406
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:23,996
produce output.


407
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:26,336
The Soup Chef app is available


408
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:27,056
as sample code.


409
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,646
So, be sure to check that out if


410
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,596
you want to see more about how


411
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:30,866
all of this works.


412
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:33,226
We also had a session earlier


413
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,756
this week where we covered more


414
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:36,566
about how these can be used to


415
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:38,086
power follow-up questions in


416
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:38,506
Siri.


417
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:40,426
Thanks for attending.
