00:00:07,046 --> 00:00:08,456
>> Hello, welcome to what's new


3
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:09,186
in ClassKit.


4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,016
My name is John Calhoun.


5
00:00:11,286 --> 00:00:12,496
I'm an iOS Engineer on the


6
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:13,886
ClassKit and Schoolwork Team.


7
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:16,646
In case you are new to ClassKit,


8
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:18,266
I'll begin with an introduction


9
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:19,486
to give you some context for


10
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,216
what follows.


11
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:21,976
And what follows are the new


12
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:23,716
features for ClassKit as well as


13
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:25,366
a brief discussion of best


14
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:26,796
coding practices that you might


15
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:27,546
want to consider.


16
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:30,836
Let's begin with what ClassKit


17
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:31,156
is.


18
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:34,146
ClassKit is a framework that


19
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:36,466
Apple introduced in iOS 11.3.


20
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:39,056
It's a core part of Apple's


21
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:40,516
education ecosystem.


22
00:00:41,036 --> 00:00:42,516
So if you consider your app to


23
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:44,546
also target education, then you


24
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:45,636
should become familiar with the


25
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:47,246
ClassKit framework and what it


26
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:47,946
can do for your app.


27
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:51,996
The whole purpose of ClassKit is


28
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:53,076
to allow your app to share a


29
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:54,156
student's progress with a


30
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:54,646
teacher.


31
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:56,446
I'll discuss what this means in


32
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:57,666
more detail in a bit.


33
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:01,126
And because student data is so


34
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:03,056
important, ClassKit exists to


35
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:04,245
ensure that the data remains


36
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:06,246
secure and is only accessible to


37
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:08,476
specific users like the teachers


38
00:01:08,476 --> 00:01:09,776
who have been granted privileges


39
00:01:09,956 --> 00:01:11,086
to access that data.


40
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,186
But let's move on to an example.


41
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:15,436
I'm going to use an imaginary


42
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:17,266
application as an example today.


43
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:19,236
This will be a simple app that


44
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:20,606
introduces the user to writing


45
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:20,966
code.


46
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,126
It contains a number of sections


47
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,236
that the student works through.


48
00:01:25,156 --> 00:01:26,796
There are exercises and quizzes


49
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,246
along the way that check to see


50
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:29,236
how well the student is


51
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:30,456
understanding the material.


52
00:01:31,036 --> 00:01:32,246
So it already has the notion of


53
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:33,886
activities and it will be nice


54
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,256
to share the student's progress


55
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:35,936
with a teacher.


56
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:37,906
In short, it's a good candidate


57
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:38,586
for ClassKit.


58
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:42,596
Here's the student using the


59
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:42,956
app.


60
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:45,796
And somehow the app would like


61
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:47,056
to share the student's progress


62
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:48,606
with the teacher and do so in a


63
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:50,006
way that protects the student's


64
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:50,556
privacy.


65
00:01:52,186 --> 00:01:53,646
This is the role that ClassKit


66
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,486
facilitates.


67
00:01:55,186 --> 00:01:56,446
ClassKit insures that the


68
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:57,886
student data stored on the


69
00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:59,776
device, sent to the Cloud, and


70
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,496
stored in the Cloud is always


71
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:01,936
secure.


72
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,436
And ClassKit insures that access


73
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:06,386
to this data is available only


74
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:07,316
to users with the right


75
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:07,966
privileges.


76
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:09,246
For example, the student's


77
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:09,696
teacher.


78
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:12,116
So how does a teacher or the


79
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:13,616
student for that matter, see


80
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:15,316
their progress in a ClassKit


81
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:16,106
enabled app?


82
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,226
Apple provides an application


83
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,076
called Schoolwork for iOS.


84
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:23,816
It's a free app for the iPad.


85
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:25,116
It's been available since


86
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:26,196
ClassKit debuted.


87
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:27,546
You can download it today.


88
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:30,526
It's been used by schools not


89
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:31,866
only in the United States, but


90
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:32,996
in other countries as well.


91
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,766
Teachers use Schoolwork to


92
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:36,096
create assignments called


93
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:37,976
handouts and students receive


94
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,176
these handouts from within


95
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:39,726
Schoolwork.


96
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:42,696
When your application in


97
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,436
response to a handout activity


98
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:46,856
records progress, it is within


99
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,506
Schoolwork that the teacher and


100
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:49,956
student both can track this


101
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:50,586
progress.


102
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:53,116
Let's briefly look at Schoolwork


103
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:54,386
so you can understand the


104
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:55,136
workflow.


105
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:57,466
The first time you launch


106
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:59,096
Schoolwork as a developer, you


107
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,356
may see a screen like this.


108
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:02,666
Schoolwork requires a managed


109
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,166
Apple ID.


110
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,286
These are the type of Apple IDs


111
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,646
that schools use in order to


112
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:07,956
assign them to students and


113
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:08,456
teachers.


114
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:10,596
Since most of us don't have a


115
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:12,786
managed Apple ID, we've provided


116
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:14,846
a useful switch in iOS under


117
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,366
Settings in the Developer's


118
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:16,866
Section.


119
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:20,026
You'll need the Developer


120
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:21,226
Install of iOS.


121
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:23,186
This adds additional developer


122
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:24,696
options in the Settings app.


123
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:27,706
One of the settings is labeled


124
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:28,666
ClassKit API.


125
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,686
Here you can emulate the role of


126
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:32,946
either a user with teacher


127
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,796
privileges, or a user with


128
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:35,836
student privileges.


129
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:37,676
Initially it is off.


130
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:41,126
But select Teacher and when you


131
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:42,516
launch Schoolwork, you'll have


132
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:44,196
the ability to create handouts


133
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:45,416
and assign them to a student.


134
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,186
Go back into Settings and switch


135
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,256
the ClassKit API role to Student


136
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:52,616
and when you return to


137
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:54,176
Schoolwork, you're now your


138
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,846
student persona and you can


139
00:03:55,846 --> 00:03:57,316
complete that handout that you


140
00:03:57,316 --> 00:03:58,706
just assigned from your teacher


141
00:03:58,706 --> 00:03:59,196
persona.


142
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:01,526
If you're still with me, you can


143
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:03,026
then switch back to the teacher


144
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:04,736
role and see your student


145
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,116
persona's progress.


146
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:09,236
Okay, if you've never used


147
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:10,876
Schoolwork, here's an example of


148
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,146
what a handout looks like.


149
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:14,376
The handout recipients displayed


150
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:15,586
at the top of the card are


151
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:16,716
chosen by the teacher.


152
00:04:16,986 --> 00:04:18,486
The title and instructions for


153
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,666
the handout just below the


154
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,286
recipients are created by the


155
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:22,065
teacher as well.


156
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:25,506
But the activity, the icon


157
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:26,926
representation of what you can


158
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:28,886
see here, could be an activity


159
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,706
in your ClassKit enabled app.


160
00:04:31,456 --> 00:04:33,086
So how do we get from your code,


161
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:35,206
your app, to a handout?


162
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:37,726
By adopting ClassKit.


163
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:40,126
And there's an entire


164
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:43,246
presentation from WWDC 2018 that


165
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:44,926
covers ClassKit and it's full


166
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:45,686
feature set.


167
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:47,596
But for brevity, I'll give you a


168
00:04:47,596 --> 00:04:49,176
primer on one specific and


169
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:52,016
important class in ClassKit, the


170
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:53,196
CLSContext.


171
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:55,856
If you're not familiar with the


172
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:57,626
whole of ClassKit, understanding


173
00:04:57,626 --> 00:04:59,146
at least the CLSContext will


174
00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:00,666
give you insight into how


175
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,116
exactly your app can appear in


176
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:03,656
Schoolwork and be added to a


177
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:04,246
handout.


178
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:05,866
It is through the use of


179
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:07,836
CLSContexts that you're app can


180
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:09,206
surface the activities that it


181
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:09,796
supports.


182
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,296
If your app teaches coding, each


183
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:13,556
lesson might be an individual


184
00:05:13,556 --> 00:05:15,526
activity and so each lesson


185
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:16,756
would have a corresponding


186
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:18,006
CLSContext.


187
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:20,566
And when a student is using your


188
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:22,896
app, those same CLSContexts


189
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,456
provide the scaffolding upon


190
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,696
which you hang the progress


191
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:25,966
data.


192
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,356
In the example app, I mentioned


193
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:29,836
we can keep track of time spent


194
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:31,986
within a given lesson, or if


195
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:33,176
there is a quiz in the app, we


196
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:34,486
can record the quiz score for


197
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,076
that student as progress data.


198
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:39,476
And as I alluded to, your


199
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:41,196
application can create as many


200
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:43,216
CLSContexts as there are


201
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:44,636
activities within your app.


202
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:46,266
As many as makes sense.


203
00:05:46,986 --> 00:05:48,516
ClassKit has your organize them


204
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,876
in a tree structure with


205
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:51,536
child-parent relationships.


206
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:54,886
So let's take a look at what is


207
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:56,526
mean by your app's Context Tree.


208
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,246
It begins with the one


209
00:05:58,246 --> 00:06:00,276
CLSContext that your app doesn't


210
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:00,736
create.


211
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:02,786
This is the main app context.


212
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:05,236
The main app context is created


213
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:06,606
for you by ClassKit when you


214
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:08,526
request it and it is this


215
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:11,046
context that all CLSContext that


216
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,406
you will create will descend


217
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,736
from, will be children of.


218
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:16,006
It's the root node of the tree.


219
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:18,806
So before you do anything at all


220
00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:20,366
with ClassKit in your app, you


221
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:21,836
need to request your main app


222
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:23,336
context from ClassKit.


223
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,206
You do this with a simple call


224
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:27,626
to the CLSDatastore singleton as


225
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:28,226
shown here.


226
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,096
But, before we go on to creating


227
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:32,726
contexts and adding them to our


228
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,746
main app context, we need to


229
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:37,326
step back and ask, what contexts


230
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:39,536
or activities does our app want


231
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:40,066
to present?


232
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:43,246
I'll stick with the example of


233
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:44,536
an app that is an introduction


234
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:45,456
on how to code.


235
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:47,546
For our example, I'll imagine


236
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:48,526
that there are three major


237
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:49,546
sections in the app.


238
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:52,156
An Intro section, a section on


239
00:06:52,156 --> 00:06:54,066
Variables and Datatypes, and


240
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,526
then one on Conditionals.


241
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:57,836
We could consider each of these


242
00:06:57,836 --> 00:06:59,866
an activity but ask yourself, if


243
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,306
a teacher might want to assign


244
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:02,996
one of these sections as part of


245
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:03,576
a handout.


246
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:05,506
These are large sections and


247
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:06,806
might cover a little too much


248
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:07,756
for a single handout.


249
00:07:07,756 --> 00:07:09,836
It might be too large in scope.


250
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,546
But digging deeper into our app,


251
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,866
within each section our app has


252
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:15,976
individual lessons.


253
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:18,586
The lessons are smaller, more


254
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:19,846
bite-sized if you will.


255
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:21,826
It makes more sense to expose


256
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:23,876
these instead at the activities.


257
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,216
Since the sections were rather


258
00:07:26,216 --> 00:07:28,066
broad, I'm going to assume no


259
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,586
teacher would assign an entire


260
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:30,136
section.


261
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:31,966
So I've removed them from


262
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:32,806
consideration.


263
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:34,476
We're left with these seven


264
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:35,066
lessons.


265
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:38,126
Oh, additionally in our app,


266
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:39,466
some of the lessons are followed


267
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:40,966
by a quiz to see how well the


268
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,416
student understood the lesson.


269
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:44,496
These would make nice activities


270
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:45,836
with which our app can provide


271
00:07:45,836 --> 00:07:47,306
meaningful progress data to the


272
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:49,356
teacher like what score the


273
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:50,656
student gets on a quiz.


274
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:52,566
So where does that leave us?


275
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:54,546
We decide to take advantage of


276
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:55,926
the tree structure that ClassKit


277
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:56,446
allows.


278
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:58,296
The quizzes then can be children


279
00:07:58,296 --> 00:07:59,736
activities of the lessons that


280
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:00,256
they cover.


281
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:03,416
Okay, each item here makes sense


282
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:05,476
as an individual, progress


283
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:06,826
trackable activity.


284
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:08,276
They're not too broad.


285
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:10,376
But now let's see how an app can


286
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:11,666
go about representing these


287
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,046
activities as CLSContexts.


288
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:17,716
So I've depicted the activities


289
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:19,556
now in a tree like arrangement.


290
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:21,296
At the top of the tree is not


291
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:22,966
surprisingly, the main app


292
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:24,646
content that ClassKit provides


293
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:25,046
our app.


294
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:26,916
And descending from the main app


295
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,556
context are the first level of


296
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:29,076
children.


297
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:31,146
These are the seven lessons that


298
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:31,876
I described.


299
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,826
Or a lesson had a quiz, of


300
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:35,606
course we have a child seal as


301
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,296
context that represents that


302
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:37,726
quiz.


303
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:39,996
The labels I'm showing here for


304
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:42,706
each app created CLSContext is


305
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:45,086
the CLSContexts identifier


306
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:45,686
property.


307
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:48,606
The identifier is any string you


308
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:50,776
wish to assign to a CLSContext.


309
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:52,526
It's never seen by the teacher


310
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:53,666
or student so you can use


311
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,916
whatever nomenclature makes


312
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,606
sense for you.


313
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:57,686
For this example, I came up with


314
00:08:57,686 --> 00:08:59,346
something fairly compact but


315
00:08:59,346 --> 00:08:59,876
descriptive.


316
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,396
CLSContexts have a title


317
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:04,356
property as well.


318
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:05,686
And this is what the teacher and


319
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:07,256
student will see as I will soon


320
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:07,816
demonstrate.


321
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:09,706
I'm showing only a portion of


322
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:11,176
the context tree here with their


323
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,576
titles because of how much


324
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:14,006
visual space they would take up


325
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:14,606
on the slide.


326
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,146
But let's return to the


327
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:17,946
identifiers.


328
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:19,586
From the software side, we deal


329
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:20,846
with the identifier property


330
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:21,606
exclusively.


331
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:24,486
Once a CLSContext with a give


332
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:25,966
identifier is added to your


333
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,396
context tree, it will have an


334
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:30,176
implied identifier path.


335
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,966
ClassKit API often make


336
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,906
reference to this path so it is


337
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:36,616
worthwhile briefly explaining


338
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:36,993
it.


339
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:38,916
An identifier path is an array


340
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,766
of strings, an array of


341
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:43,466
identifiers of CLSContexts from


342
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,286
the root of your context tree to


343
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:47,196
the CLSContext in question.


344
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:49,436
I begin at any child of the main


345
00:09:49,436 --> 00:09:50,886
app context and grab it's


346
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:51,606
identifier.


347
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:53,696
Append the identifiers of the


348
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:55,606
children as you descend the tree


349
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:57,196
until you arrive at some


350
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,976
intended CLSContext.


351
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:01,296
You have the identifier path now


352
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:02,876
for that CLSContext.


353
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,556
Just to give you a single


354
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:07,056
example, consider the


355
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:08,796
highlighted CLSContext.


356
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:11,776
The identifier path that looks


357
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:14,036
like 4 underscore structs and 4


358
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:16,126
underscore quiz uniquely refers


359
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:18,636
to this one CLSContext and is


360
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:20,466
this quiz context's identifier


361
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:20,816
path.


362
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:24,376
Now having examined our app and


363
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:25,666
considered the activities we


364
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,946
want to support and their


365
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:29,166
hierarchy, we've arrived at this


366
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,506
tree representation of


367
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,796
CLSContexts.


368
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:34,046
If you want to see code examples


369
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,076
on how to create CLSContexts,


370
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:37,866
there are resources associated


371
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:38,966
with this presentation.


372
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:40,986
To stay within the scope of this


373
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:42,796
presentation, I want to go back


374
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:44,206
briefly to Schoolwork so we can


375
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,266
tie this discussion of


376
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:47,326
CLSContexts back into the


377
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:48,666
teacher-student workflow.


378
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:51,526
You'll recall that in Settings


379
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:52,586
you could select a teacher


380
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:53,106
persona.


381
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:55,086
If you select this and then you


382
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:57,556
launch Schoolwork, there is a


383
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,196
plus button in the top right


384
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:00,716
corner of the Dashboard that


385
00:11:00,716 --> 00:11:02,196
allows the teacher to create a


386
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:02,906
new handout.


387
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:06,476
Tapping on that, presents this


388
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:06,736
view.


389
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:08,666
It allows you to create a new


390
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,216
handout.


391
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:11,876
As I mentioned earlier, the


392
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,596
teacher determines who to assign


393
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:15,196
the handout to, gives the


394
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,476
handout a title, and


395
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,196
instructions.


396
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,566
But more interesting to us, is


397
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:21,876
the blue plus button, labeled


398
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:23,246
Add Activity.


399
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:25,696
Tapping on that brings up a list


400
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:26,416
of activities.


401
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:28,316
There are a number of different


402
00:11:28,316 --> 00:11:29,826
options for adding various


403
00:11:29,826 --> 00:11:31,526
document types, but we want to


404
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:33,046
pay attention to the top item,


405
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:34,106
Apps.


406
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,926
Tapping that brings up a list of


407
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:39,056
App activities, and there,


408
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:40,896
second on the list, is our


409
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:41,696
application.


410
00:11:42,346 --> 00:11:44,246
That our app appears at all


411
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:45,636
indicates that our app has


412
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:47,716
created a CLSContext tree.


413
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,066
The disclosure chevron to the


414
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:52,666
right tells the teacher to drill


415
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,086
in for the activities for this


416
00:11:54,086 --> 00:11:54,346
app.


417
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:56,946
And having tapped to drill in,


418
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:58,456
guess what is presented to the


419
00:11:58,456 --> 00:11:58,926
teacher?


420
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,426
The CLSContexts that are the


421
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:03,346
first descendants of our app's


422
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:04,616
main app context.


423
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,646
Here of course we are displaying


424
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:08,796
the titles for each CLSContext,


425
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,026
not the identifiers.


426
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,876
That's why their human readable.


427
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:15,286
Notice that the last five have a


428
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:16,436
disclosure chevron.


429
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:18,576
It should surprise you that


430
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:20,396
these are the CLSContexts that


431
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:21,546
had a quiz as well.


432
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:25,506
For example, if the teacher taps


433
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:27,336
into the third item down, "What


434
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:30,086
is a variable?", there's the


435
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:30,626
quiz.


436
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,376
But let's say that the teacher


437
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,736
is creating a handout that


438
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:34,716
introduces Swift.


439
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:36,196
The class is not yet for


440
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:38,016
variables so instead, the


441
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:39,546
teacher backs up by tapping the


442
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:40,556
button to return.


443
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:42,856
The teacher then taps the Select


444
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:44,746
button in the upper right and


445
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:46,006
selects the "What is Swift?"


446
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:48,176
activity. This is how you add an


447
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:49,326
activity to a handout.


448
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,036
So now, we're back on the


449
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:53,276
handout editing view.


450
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:54,856
And at this point, the teacher


451
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:56,446
can tap Post in the upper right


452
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:58,056
corner and the handout will then


453
00:12:58,056 --> 00:12:59,466
be sent to the assignees.


454
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:02,736
And as we saw before, a handout


455
00:13:02,736 --> 00:13:04,366
card with the activity displayed


456
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,836
will appear in Schoolwork on


457
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:06,816
everyone's device.


458
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:08,736
There is more to learn in


459
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:10,416
ClassKit regarding what happens


460
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,476
when the student taps on the


461
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:13,226
activity and your app launches


462
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:14,866
and how you report progress


463
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:16,656
data, but that is outside of the


464
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:17,816
scope of this session.


465
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:19,946
I would refer you instead to the


466
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:21,796
many resources associated with


467
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:23,536
this session in particular, the


468
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,596
ClassKit session from WWDC 2018.


469
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:29,636
But with that somewhat focused


470
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:31,606
background on ClassKit, let's go


471
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:32,896
now to the new features.


472
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:35,046
The features I'm going to


473
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:36,496
describe were introduced in


474
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:39,156
ClassKit for iOS version 12.2,


475
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:40,766
so these are already available


476
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:41,186
today.


477
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:43,486
We've added a new context


478
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:45,436
provider extension, added a new


479
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:46,936
function you can call to mark an


480
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:49,106
activity as complete and added a


481
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:50,346
new progress value.


482
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:52,606
The first feature I'll discuss


483
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:53,846
is the Context Provider


484
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:54,476
Extension.


485
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:55,866
The name might be


486
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:56,986
self-explanatory.


487
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:58,786
It is a new extension you can


488
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:00,236
create for your app that will be


489
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:01,666
called upon to create your


490
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,636
CLSContext tree to provide


491
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:04,386
contexts.


492
00:14:05,506 --> 00:14:06,846
But before I explain how it


493
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,326
works, I want to show you how


494
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:09,666
you would initially create this


495
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,246
extension.


496
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:12,296
Here is the most recent Xcode.


497
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:13,986
If you go to the File menu and


498
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,526
select New and then Target, for


499
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,036
the iOS application Extensions


500
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:20,506
Templates, there is a new


501
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:22,716
template for ClassKit Context


502
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:23,226
Provider.


503
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,366
When you add this target to your


504
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:26,896
app, it creates a single new


505
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:27,766
file for you.


506
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:29,846
Let me explain how the Context


507
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:31,646
Provider Extension works by


508
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:33,066
showing you boilerplate code


509
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:33,996
that you might implement.


510
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,566
I'll show you after how it will


511
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:37,126
likely be used by Schoolwork.


512
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:40,846
So, I said that a context


513
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,496
provider extension adds a single


514
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:43,026
file.


515
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:44,586
It's in fact just a single


516
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:45,176
class.


517
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:48,196
CLSContextProvider is the super


518
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:50,146
class where you must override


519
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:51,526
just one function,


520
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:54,726
updateDescendants of context


521
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:55,546
completion.


522
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:57,306
ClassKit will call your


523
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:58,876
extensions updateDescendants


524
00:14:58,876 --> 00:14:59,216
call.


525
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:01,296
When called, your extension is


526
00:15:01,296 --> 00:15:02,936
being asked to add a minimum,


527
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:04,846
update or provide the children's


528
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:07,686
CLSContexts, of the CLSContext


529
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:08,716
being passed in.


530
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:10,826
You don't return these children


531
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,886
in the function, mind you.


532
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:13,956
Your extension is being asked to


533
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,736
add or update just a specific


534
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:17,456
part of your app's context tree


535
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:18,966
and to save those changes.


536
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:21,896
And for reasons I'll explain


537
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:23,366
your code in this function


538
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:24,806
should be as performant as


539
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:25,356
possible.


540
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:28,556
I'll go back to our earlier


541
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:30,146
example to give you an idea of


542
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,386
how this all might work.


543
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,236
Imagine your extension being


544
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:34,996
called updateDescendants of


545
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:36,756
context completion being called.


546
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:39,226
And the CLSContext passed in is


547
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:40,876
your app's main app context.


548
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:42,656
How does your code know it's the


549
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:43,706
main app context?


550
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:45,536
The simplest check is to see if


551
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:47,536
the CLSContext passed in has a


552
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:48,016
parent.


553
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:50,156
Only the main app context is


554
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:50,896
parentless.


555
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:53,676
So, your contract is to update


556
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,666
your context tree to provide at


557
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,516
least the first tier, that is,


558
00:15:57,516 --> 00:15:58,936
the immediate children


559
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:00,966
CLSContext of your main app


560
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:01,646
context.


561
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:03,906
If you recall from our example,


562
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,166
this would correspond to the


563
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,966
CLSContext what is an IDE, what


564
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,806
is Swift, what is a variable, et


565
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:10,216
cetera.


566
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:12,596
Those seven top level lessons,


567
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,776
or since we've been referring to


568
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:16,136
them by their identifiers,


569
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:16,956
these.


570
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:20,796
If these children are all there,


571
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:23,146
exist already in your context


572
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:24,246
tree, do not need to be


573
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:25,996
modified, then your code need do


574
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:26,676
nothing at all.


575
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,016
You can simply call the


576
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:29,636
completion block and pass no


577
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:31,386
error to indicate all is well.


578
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:33,456
But the extension exists to


579
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:34,976
allow you to create this portion


580
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:36,466
of your tree in the event that


581
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:37,636
the teacher had never yet


582
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:39,236
visited this portion of your


583
00:16:39,236 --> 00:16:39,556
app.


584
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:41,276
Maybe they have never launched


585
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:41,916
your app at all.


586
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:44,156
I want to add though that your


587
00:16:44,156 --> 00:16:45,906
extension is free to populate


588
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:47,686
more of your app's context tree.


589
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:49,606
In fact, could populate the


590
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,396
entire tree as long as it can be


591
00:16:51,396 --> 00:16:52,076
done quickly.


592
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:54,116
You'll see why this is important


593
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:54,616
in a minute.


594
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:56,636
For this example, I'll stick to


595
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:58,146
the bare minimum and imagine


596
00:16:58,146 --> 00:16:59,296
that we only create the


597
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:00,926
immediate descendants of the


598
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:02,596
CLSContext passed in.


599
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:05,226
And so, we create those seven


600
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,026
descendants, and our context


601
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,256
tree should look like this.


602
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,526
Let me give one more example and


603
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:12,685
I think it will be clearer how


604
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:13,296
this works.


605
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:15,526
Consider now your extension is


606
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:16,246
called again.


607
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:18,566
But this time, the CLSContext


608
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:20,685
with the identifier 3 underscore


609
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:23,266
datatypes is the CLSContext


610
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:24,366
passed to the function.


611
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:27,286
The expectation is that your


612
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:29,446
code will add or update at least


613
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:31,606
the immediate descendants of 3


614
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:32,886
underscore datatypes.


615
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:35,346
And you may recall, this was


616
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,376
simply a quiz.


617
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:38,156
And so, we have added it here.


618
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,686
What is the purpose of the


619
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,326
context provider extension?


620
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:45,406
I essentially laid it out for


621
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:46,766
you, it's to give your app an


622
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,196
opportunity to create your


623
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:50,666
CLSContext tree to, in effect,


624
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,966
advertise your app's activities,


625
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:54,576
and the teacher will not have


626
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:56,046
needed to have even launched


627
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:56,556
your app.


628
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,446
Of course, the teacher will have


629
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,126
had to have downloaded your app.


630
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:02,976
But the very act of downloading


631
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:04,096
will cause your ClassKit


632
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:05,516
extension to be registered with


633
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:07,706
iOS, such as the ClassKit, and


634
00:18:07,746 --> 00:18:09,346
more specifically, Schoolwork


635
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:10,486
will be aware of those


636
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:11,696
activities available.


637
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:17,146
Some of your apps may support a


638
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,876
bevy of activities and have a


639
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:20,876
tree that may be broad or deep.


640
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,876
To create this entire tree when


641
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,216
your app launches might cause a


642
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:25,166
performance issue.


643
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,456
So, this extension is designed


644
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,056
to allow you to dole out


645
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:31,566
CLSContexts in smaller batches.


646
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:34,686
Some ClassKit apps require user


647
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:36,206
interaction before they can


648
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:37,616
begin to create their context


649
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:37,906
tree.


650
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,376
Unfortunately, the extension is


651
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:41,986
not going to be useful in those


652
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:42,536
cases.


653
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:44,306
The extension is called without


654
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:45,386
an option for your app to


655
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:46,276
display any UI.


656
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:50,246
Finally, I want to present to


657
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:51,776
you how your Context Provider


658
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,326
Extension fits in with the


659
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:54,206
teacher workflow.


660
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,176
Recall the example that I gave


661
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,456
earlier, where a teacher was


662
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:58,806
creating a handout and was


663
00:18:58,806 --> 00:18:59,676
navigating through the


664
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:00,866
activities available.


665
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:02,846
If your app has a context


666
00:19:02,846 --> 00:19:04,306
provider extension, you can


667
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:05,606
expect it to be called before


668
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:07,246
the teacher gets to this screen


669
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:07,996
in Schoolwork.


670
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:09,636
Your extension should have been


671
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:10,636
called with the main app


672
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:12,186
context, so that your app can be


673
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:13,646
presented here as having


674
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:14,926
available activities.


675
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:16,766
And should the teacher begin


676
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,186
drilling down into your app's


677
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:20,886
activity hierarchy, you can


678
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:22,606
expect repeated calls to your


679
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:24,466
extension to provide more depth


680
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:26,006
to your CLSContext tree.


681
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:28,586
Since it is possible that your


682
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,236
tree is being created in more or


683
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,166
less real time, live as the


684
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,156
teacher is drilling in, this is


685
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:35,686
why it is important that your


686
00:19:35,686 --> 00:19:37,576
extension code work quickly to


687
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,176
create and save the CLSContext


688
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:41,146
being asked for.


689
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:43,896
I think you can see now how all


690
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:44,866
the pieces of this work


691
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,776
together, the extension, your


692
00:19:46,776 --> 00:19:48,566
app's tree of activities and


693
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:49,116
Schoolwork.


694
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:52,106
The next feature new to ClassKit


695
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:53,846
is an API that allows your app


696
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:54,936
to mark an activity as


697
00:19:54,936 --> 00:19:55,456
completed.


698
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:57,416
That is, to make it easier for


699
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,936
the student to let the teacher


700
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,446
know that the activity that was


701
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,786
assigned is done.


702
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:04,486
To understand why this is a nice


703
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,576
new feature, let me revisit


704
00:20:06,576 --> 00:20:08,546
Schoolwork but briefly show you


705
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:09,446
the student side.


706
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:11,046
We've seen a bit about the


707
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:12,576
teacher workflow for assigning


708
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:13,186
activities.


709
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:14,446
What's it like to be on the


710
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,146
receiving end?


711
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:17,356
This is the handout card that I


712
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:18,046
showed earlier.


713
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:19,746
It's how the student sees it in


714
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:20,316
Schoolwork.


715
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:25,426
When they tap on it, they see


716
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:27,116
the handout with the activities,


717
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,836
just the one activity in this


718
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:29,166
case.


719
00:20:29,516 --> 00:20:31,056
Tapping on the activity takes


720
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:31,856
them to your app.


721
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:33,776
But after completing the


722
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,776
activity, the students still has


723
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,846
to come back to Schoolwork and


724
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:39,206
tap the complete button.


725
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:41,816
If your app adopts a new


726
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:43,906
ClassKit API, you can make this


727
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:45,256
last step unnecessary.


728
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:47,536
From within your app, you can


729
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:49,266
mark the activity complete by


730
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:50,576
calling a new API.


731
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:54,186
The CLSDataStore has a new


732
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:54,976
function called


733
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:57,166
completeAllAssignedActivities


734
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:58,956
matching contextPath.


735
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:01,266
The path is, of course, an


736
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,606
identifier path to the


737
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:04,926
CLSContext or activity that the


738
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:06,016
student just completed.


739
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:08,186
If, for example, the student


740
00:21:08,186 --> 00:21:09,666
just completed the, what is a


741
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,466
variable quiz within this app,


742
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,516
we can indicate it is complete


743
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:14,156
by calling


744
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:16,036
completeAllAssignedActivities


745
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:18,036
for the CLSContext with the path


746
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:20,596
2 underscore vars, 2 underscore


747
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:21,086
quiz.


748
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:23,136
The next time the student


749
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:25,516
returns to Schoolwork, it will


750
00:21:25,516 --> 00:21:27,186
indicate the activity complete.


751
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:28,946
Further, the teacher who


752
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:30,586
assigned the handout will also


753
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:31,936
find the activity marked as


754
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:33,096
complete for that student.


755
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:35,286
If your app adapts this new


756
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:36,756
call, the student's workflow


757
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:37,866
will be much smoother.


758
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:42,806
Finally, ClassKit and iOS 12.2


759
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,236
adds a new activity item type, a


760
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,776
correct/incorrect type.


761
00:21:48,396 --> 00:21:49,736
In my ClassKit overview, I


762
00:21:49,736 --> 00:21:51,766
didn't describe the CLS activity


763
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:53,796
class, but for purposes of


764
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,216
introducing this new feature,


765
00:21:55,216 --> 00:21:56,956
I'll just mention that each


766
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:59,156
CLSContext can have an activity


767
00:21:59,156 --> 00:22:01,196
in the form of a CLS activity


768
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:01,856
object.


769
00:22:02,286 --> 00:22:05,046
And, a CLS activity can have any


770
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:07,456
number of CLS activity items.


771
00:22:08,846 --> 00:22:11,396
Now, CLSActivityItem is a parent


772
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,766
class to a handful of other


773
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,356
classes.


774
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:14,916
And I'll call out one, in


775
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,106
particular, the CLSBinaryItem.


776
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:22,016
A CLSBinaryItem can only


777
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:23,666
represent progress in one of two


778
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,326
states, the flavors of which are


779
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:25,856
shown here.


780
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:27,816
Maybe the progress you want to


781
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:28,946
report is simply whether the


782
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:30,246
student passed or failed.


783
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:33,156
And CLSBinaryItem has an ENUM to


784
00:22:33,156 --> 00:22:33,996
indicate this.


785
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:36,196
Additionally, you can indicate


786
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:38,416
true versus false or yes versus


787
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:38,746
no.


788
00:22:39,596 --> 00:22:41,036
But we heard from developers


789
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:41,976
that felt as though we were


790
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:43,736
missing another binary flavor.


791
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:46,956
So, ClassKit has defined the


792
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:49,006
correct/incorrect enumeration to


793
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:50,716
describe this new type of binary


794
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:51,306
activity.


795
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:53,376
Consider the quiz example that I


796
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:54,746
mentioned for our sample app.


797
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:56,656
It consists of ten questions.


798
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:58,626
We'll probably not use a binary


799
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:00,176
activity type for the primary


800
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:01,856
activity item, because we want


801
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:02,926
to represent the score as a


802
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:03,626
quantity.


803
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:05,266
So, the teacher sees that the


804
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:07,526
student got 70%, for example.


805
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,126
But as a bonus, our app can add


806
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:12,706
additional activity items.


807
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:14,216
For example, one for each


808
00:23:14,216 --> 00:23:16,156
question, and indicate correct


809
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:17,696
or incorrect for those so that


810
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,726
the teacher can see which


811
00:23:18,726 --> 00:23:20,076
questions the student missed,


812
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:21,706
which ones they got correct.


813
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:23,906
I just offer that as one example


814
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,376
of how this type might be used.


815
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:29,246
So, finally, let's talk about


816
00:23:29,246 --> 00:23:31,416
ClassKit coding best practices.


817
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:35,036
I've already described that it


818
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:36,556
is an error to add to your


819
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:39,306
context tree, a CLSContext whose


820
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:41,296
identifier path is not unique.


821
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:43,546
At first blush, this sounds sort


822
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:44,796
of like an error that's hard to


823
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:45,206
make.


824
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:46,656
But consider the following


825
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:48,856
scenario, your app launches for


826
00:23:48,856 --> 00:23:50,446
the very first time, and you


827
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:52,586
dutifully create a CLSContext


828
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:54,276
tree in order to make available


829
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:55,426
your app's activities.


830
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:57,516
A portion of that original tree


831
00:23:57,516 --> 00:23:58,166
is shown here.


832
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,676
On your app's second launch, you


833
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:03,026
should not create your


834
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,946
CLSContext tree again.


835
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:08,366
This would be adding CLSContext


836
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,256
that have identifier paths that


837
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:11,826
conflict with the existing ones.


838
00:24:12,236 --> 00:24:13,716
You should always check that a


839
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:15,936
CLSContext does not exist first


840
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:17,516
in your tree before adding it.


841
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:20,576
There are a few ways to check to


842
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:22,736
see if a CLSContext is already


843
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:23,556
part of your tree.


844
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:24,956
One way is to call the


845
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:27,486
CLSDataStore function contexts


846
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:28,906
matchingIdentifierPath.


847
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:30,636
And when your completion block


848
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,566
is called, a note that the call


849
00:24:32,566 --> 00:24:34,896
is asynchronous, an empty array


850
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,606
for the CLSContext returned


851
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:38,196
would indicate the context with


852
00:24:38,196 --> 00:24:40,086
that path does not yet exist.


853
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:41,866
So, it would be correct to now


854
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:43,276
create it.


855
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:44,906
Or, instead there was a


856
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:47,126
CLSContext function descendant's


857
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:49,146
matchingIdentifierPath that you


858
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:49,706
could call.


859
00:24:50,226 --> 00:24:51,656
It also is asynchronous.


860
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,096
And like the previous example,


861
00:24:53,396 --> 00:24:55,046
if no context is passed to your


862
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:56,926
completion block, then again, it


863
00:24:56,926 --> 00:24:58,236
is safe for your app to create


864
00:24:58,236 --> 00:25:00,036
and add the new CLSContext.


865
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:01,786
There are going to be numerous


866
00:25:01,786 --> 00:25:03,126
places within your app where


867
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,336
you're going to have to make one


868
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,176
of these checks.


869
00:25:05,826 --> 00:25:08,096
And if you adopt the new Context


870
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,666
Provider Extension, you're


871
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,076
adding even more vectors from


872
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,106
which you will need to test


873
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:14,286
whether a CLSContext has already


874
00:25:14,286 --> 00:25:15,976
been added to your tree or not.


875
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:18,906
So I wanted you to be aware of


876
00:25:18,906 --> 00:25:19,886
what might be an elegant


877
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,666
solution, which is to implement


878
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,086
the CLSDataStore Delegate


879
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:24,746
function, createContext


880
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:26,976
forIdentifier, parentContext,


881
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:28,366
parentIdentifierPath.


882
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:30,316
If you make one of the classes


883
00:25:30,316 --> 00:25:31,896
in your app, the CLSDataStore


884
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,676
Delegate, then when you call one


885
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:35,076
of the previous functions like


886
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,776
CLSDataStore context


887
00:25:36,776 --> 00:25:38,866
matchingIdentifierPath, this


888
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:40,426
delegate function will only be


889
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:42,416
called if the context has never


890
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,636
been created, implementing the


891
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:46,296
delegate sort of bottlenecks


892
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,196
then all context creation to


893
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:49,636
just one place in your app.


894
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,106
In my experience, the actual


895
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:53,786
implementation of creating a


896
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,766
CLSContext is pretty app


897
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:56,356
specific.


898
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:57,646
So I've left the code empty


899
00:25:57,646 --> 00:25:57,986
here.


900
00:25:58,316 --> 00:25:59,996
If you are adding ClassKit


901
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:01,576
support for the first time, the


902
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:05,046
2018 WWDC session on ClassKit or


903
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:06,906
the available sample code is an


904
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:08,086
excellent place to start.


905
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:11,346
Here's an example of a simple


906
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:12,856
helper function that might exist


907
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:13,426
in your app.


908
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:14,956
This function we'll call


909
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:17,056
beginActivity, can be called to


910
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:19,296
make a specific CLSContext the


911
00:26:19,296 --> 00:26:20,436
active context.


912
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,626
We pass in only an identifier


913
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:23,026
path.


914
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:25,026
The function calls the


915
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:27,126
CLSContext query to find the


916
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:28,256
descendant that matches the


917
00:26:28,256 --> 00:26:29,906
identifier path passed in.


918
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:32,226
Again, since we have elsewhere


919
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:33,866
in this application set up the


920
00:26:33,866 --> 00:26:36,226
CLSDataStore Delegate, we can be


921
00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:37,586
sure that if the specified


922
00:26:37,586 --> 00:26:40,156
CLSContext was never created, it


923
00:26:40,156 --> 00:26:42,036
will be in the delegate function


924
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:43,886
and therefore a CLSContext


925
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:45,096
should be returned from the


926
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:45,506
query.


927
00:26:47,026 --> 00:26:48,496
We make the context return to


928
00:26:48,496 --> 00:26:50,456
active, create a new activity


929
00:26:50,456 --> 00:26:52,056
for it and start that activity.


930
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:54,076
These series of calls indicates


931
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:55,696
we want to record progress in


932
00:26:55,696 --> 00:26:57,306
the form of time spent for a


933
00:26:57,306 --> 00:26:59,046
specific CLSContext.


934
00:26:59,896 --> 00:27:02,326
And finally, we call save on the


935
00:27:02,326 --> 00:27:04,336
CLSDataStore to initiate these


936
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:05,796
series of calls that we've made.


937
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:07,916
Likely, you will create plenty


938
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,326
of other helper functions like


939
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:10,866
this one, but the context


940
00:27:10,866 --> 00:27:12,236
creation code need to live in


941
00:27:12,236 --> 00:27:13,726
only one place, in your


942
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:15,776
CLSDataStore Delegate function.


943
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:18,906
If you are new to ClassKit, I


944
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:20,366
hope this brief introduction has


945
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:21,366
given you a taste of its


946
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:22,236
capabilities.


947
00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:24,006
And if you think students and


948
00:27:24,006 --> 00:27:25,476
teachers would benefit from


949
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:26,926
using your app in the education


950
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:28,046
realm, you should give


951
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,506
consideration to adopting


952
00:27:29,506 --> 00:27:30,196
ClassKit.


953
00:27:30,376 --> 00:27:32,376
If you are already familiar with


954
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:33,726
ClassKit, I hope you take


955
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:35,146
advantage of the new features we


956
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:36,616
added for 2019.


957
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,336
All of these were the result of


958
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:39,996
feedback from developers like


959
00:27:39,996 --> 00:27:40,596
yourselves.


960
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:43,026
