00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:07,307 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,978 line:0
Hi, everyone. My name is Ayaka,


3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,380 line:0
and I'm here to show you
how to get your app's actions


4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:14,781 line:0
featured in the Shortcuts app.


5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,985 line:-2
In this session,
we're gonna focus on two things.


6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,722 line:-2
First, we're gonna talk about
automation suggestions.


7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,491 line:-2
Specifically,
we'll talk about how your app's actions


8
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:28,495 line:-2
can be featured as a part of automations
that are suggested by the system.


9
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,798 line:-2
Next, we'll briefly talk about
how your actions can be surfaced


10
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,034 line:-2
in the Shortcuts Gallery
and the Shortcuts Editor


11
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:37,771 line:-2
so people can more easily discover
and create their own shortcuts with them.


12
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,041 line:-2
Before we talk
about automation suggestions,


13
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,709 line:-1
let's talk about automations.


14
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,680 line:-2
In iOS 13,
we introduced personal automations.


15
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:51,351 line:-2
Personal automations
allow you to run shortcuts automatically


16
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,253 line:-1
based on a specific condition.


17
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:57,391 line:-2
For example, one of my simplest
and favorite automations I have


18
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,827 line:-2
is one that opens my reading list
when I arrive at my local bookstore


19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,096 line:-1
so I know exactly what I should look for.


20
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,400 line:-1
Alongside automations in iOS 13,


21
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:10,070 line:-2
we also introduced automation suggestions
in the Shortcuts Gallery,


22
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:13,674 line:-2
which are centered around daily routines,
like going to and from work.


23
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,978 line:0
In iOS 14,
we extended it to support all actions,


24
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:21,982 line:0
including user activities, system intents
such as INPlayMediaIntent,


25
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,284 line:0
and custom intents that your app defines.


26
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:28,989 line:0
By having your app donate interactions
when a person does something in your app,


27
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,824 line:0
the system will learn and make suggestions


28
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,826 line:0
for things
that they might want to automate.


29
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,663 line:0
Here, because I use Duolingo
a lot in the evening,


30
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,300 line:0
I'm getting a suggestion to practice
my French every weekday at 9:00.


31
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,836 line:0
I think that's a pretty useful automation,


32
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,005 line:0
and something that could help
strengthen my habit.


33
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,774 line:0
I'm gonna tap on the suggestion to add it.


34
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,612 line:-2
And then all I have to do is tap
"Add Automation"


35
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,046 line:-1
to add it to my collection.


36
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:59,653 line:-2
And here it is in my automations list
along with my other automation.


37
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,789 line:-2
We think it's a great, simple experience
for people,


38
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,058 line:-2
especially for those
who are just getting their feet wet


39
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,627 line:-1
in the world of automations.


40
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:10,030 line:-2
As I briefly mentioned earlier,
these suggestions are made possible


41
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:13,300 line:-2
through donations of interactions
when a person does something in your app.


42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,537 line:-2
In fact, donating is the only thing
that you need to do


43
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,106 line:-2
in order for the system to learn
and make these suggestions.


44
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,608 line:-1
Let's see what that looks like in code.


45
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:26,680 line:-2
Let's say I have a soup delivery app,
and I want to donate a order.soup intent


46
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,749 line:-1
when a person, well, orders a soup.


47
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:33,387 line:-2
First, I'm gonna initialize the intent,
which I've named PlaceOrderIntent.


48
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,858 line:-2
Next, I need to know what I'm ordering,
specifically which soup,


49
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,794 line:-2
so I'm gonna get my soup
from this order object I have.


50
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,997 line:-2
Then I'm gonna set
the intent's soup property


51
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,466 line:-1
to an INObject that represents the soup.


52
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,004 line:-2
Next, I'm gonna set some images
for my parameters,


53
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,041 line:-2
one for the soup
and one for the delivery location.


54
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:57,711 line:-2
And then I'll wrap the intent
in an INInteraction.


55
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,682 line:-2
And finally,
I'm gonna call donate on the interaction


56
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,151 line:-2
to tell the system
that someone ordered a soup.


57
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,655 line:-2
The types of actions that are supported
by automation suggestions


58
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,790 line:-1
include system intents,


59
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,226 line:-2
as well as custom intents
and user activities.


60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,830 line:-2
Because intents can run in the background
without having to open the app,


61
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,233 line:-1
we recommend using intents here.


62
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,069 line:-2
If you want to learn more about
how your app can adopt intents,


63
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,071 line:-2
you can check out
some of these past talks.


64
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,175 line:0
The first one
is "Introduction to Siri Shortcuts,"


65
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:31,445 line:0
which shows you the fundamentals
of how shortcuts work with intents.


66
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:34,681 line:0
And the second one
is "Introducing Parameters for Shortcuts,"


67
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,117 line:0
which shows you how to make your shortcuts
even more powerful


68
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,653 line:0
by supporting
user-configurable parameters.


69
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,423 line:0
By the way, we support
many different automation types.


70
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,827 line:-2
We have automation types
ranging from time of day


71
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,295 line:-1
to when you arrive at a location


72
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,864 line:-2
to when you connect
to a particular Bluetooth device.


73
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,535 line:-2
As someone who turns on
my reading lights every evening,


74
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,437 line:-2
I might get a suggestion for setting
my "reading time" home scene


75
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,006 line:-1
every evening at 8:00.


76
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,476 line:-2
Or as someone who calls in
to a lot of meetings on my phone,


77
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:05,245 line:-2
I might get a suggestion for dialing in
to my conference room


78
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,247 line:-1
every time I connect my AirPods.


79
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,050 line:-2
The types of automations
that the system could suggest


80
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:13,053 line:-2
are as endlessly unique
as people's habits and routines.


81
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,123 line:-1
Going back to this list of suggestions,


82
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,726 line:-2
another thing I want to explore
further today is Daily Routines.


83
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,463 line:-2
Daily Routines are a special type
of automation suggestion


84
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,365 line:-1
that we introduced last year.


85
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,634 line:-2
These are centered
around a person's routine,


86
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,636 line:-2
and there is a personalized,
step-by-step flow


87
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:33,473 line:-2
that guides people through the process
of setting up a multistep automation.


88
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,176 line:-1
Specifically, we have three of them.


89
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,415 line:0
One for going to work, one for going home,
and another for when you're at the gym.


90
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,786 line:0
There are several opportunities
for your app to be a part of these flows.


91
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:50,157 line:0
For example, if you're a media app
that plays music, podcasts or audiobooks,


92
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:53,260 line:0
you can be a part of all three
of these flows in the "Play Media" step


93
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,696 line:0
by adopting INPlayMediaIntent.


94
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,631 line:0
If you're a workouts app,


95
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,766 line:0
you can be a part of
the "At the Gym" routine


96
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,935 line:0
by adopting INStartWorkoutIntent.


97
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,173 line:-2
Let's walk through what it looks like
to set up a daily routine.


98
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,911 line:-2
I'm gonna tap on the first suggestion here
to set up a "Going Home" routine.


99
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,548 line:-2
There's a step-by-step flow
that guides me through the process


100
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,116 line:-1
of setting up this automation.


101
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,619 line:-1
For example, for "Going Home,"


102
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,221 line:-2
it first asks me
what media I want to play.


103
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,892 line:-2
If your app plays media,
your app can show up on this list as well.


104
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:29,062 line:-2
You can do this by adopting and donating
INPlayMediaIntent


105
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,099 line:-2
to inform the system
that someone played some media.


106
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,835 line:-2
Over time,
if that person does this consistently


107
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:38,038 line:-2
and the predictions model
correlates this action with their commute,


108
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:41,241 line:-2
the Shortcuts app will start suggesting it
as a part of this flow.


109
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,510 line:-1
Once I choose my playlist,


110
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,413 line:-2
I can choose to include
getting directions home.


111
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,483 line:-2
After that, I get an option
to send a contact of my choice


112
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,318 line:-1
an ETA for getting home.


113
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,688 line:-2
For example, something like,
"I'll be home at 6:30."


114
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,292 line:-2
And finally, I can choose
if I want this to be an automation


115
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,260 line:-1
or a shortcut that I run manually.


116
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,230 line:-2
I'm gonna select
"Show Automatically" here.


117
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,634 line:-2
And once I do that,
it gets added to my automations list here


118
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,870 line:-2
to run ten minutes
before leaving for home.


119
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,307 line:-2
And this is the full shortcut
that got added to my library.


120
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,243 line:-1
It first starts playing some music,


121
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,146 line:-2
then gets driving directions to my home
in the Maps app,


122
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,782 line:-2
followed by the estimated driving time
to get home,


123
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,551 line:-2
and finally,
it sends a message with my ETA.


124
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,655 line:-2
I was able to set up
this personalized multistep shortcut


125
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,358 line:-2
with just a few taps
thanks to Daily Routines.


126
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:35,529 line:-2
So, if you're a media app,
be sure to adopt INPlayMediaIntent,


127
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:38,665 line:-2
and if you're a workouts app,
be sure to adopt INStartWorkoutIntent


128
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,168 line:-1
to be a part of the Daily Routines flow.


129
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,404 line:-1
That wraps up automation suggestions.


130
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,241 line:-2
Now let's talk
about the Gallery and Editor.


131
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:51,245 line:-2
Specifically, we'll take a look
at the "Shortcuts from Your Apps" section


132
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,080 line:-1
in the Gallery, and the Shortcuts Editor.


133
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,450 line:-2
This is what
the "Shortcuts from Your App" section


134
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:57,985 line:-1
looks like in the Gallery.


135
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:01,154 line:-2
If I tap on "See All,"
I see even more shortcuts.


136
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,859 line:-2
Today I want to demystify
how these shortcuts are being curated.


137
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,329 line:-2
One way to show up in this list
is by setting shortcut suggestions


138
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,698 line:-1
using INVoiceShortcutCenter.


139
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,034 line:-2
In code,
it might look something like this.


140
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,538 line:-1
First, I'm gonna take my OrderStatusIntent


141
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,506 line:-1
and wrap it in an INShortcut.


142
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:22,509 line:-2
I'll do the same
for my TopSoupsUserActivity,


143
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,878 line:-1
put them all in a suggestions array,


144
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,815 line:-2
and finally, call setShortcutSuggestions
with those suggestions.


145
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,020 line:-2
In addition,
similar to automation suggestions,


146
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:36,590 line:-2
we can be more intelligent about
what shows up by relying on donations,


147
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,492 line:-1
which I showed you how to do earlier.


148
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,296 line:-2
These are suggestions based on
how people interact with their apps,


149
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,831 line:-2
including things
that they have done recently.


150
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,967 line:-1
So, those are the two ways


151
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,503 line:-2
that you can get your app's actions
to show up in the Gallery.


152
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:51,505 line:-1
In addition to the Gallery,


153
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,842 line:-2
these same actions
will also surface in the Shortcuts Editor.


154
00:07:56,176 --> 00:08:00,781 line:-2
Here, the suggestions are based
on donations for things a person has done.


155
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:04,218 line:0
For example, I'm getting some suggestions
for music I might want to play


156
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,719 line:0
based on my playback history,


157
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:08,856 line:0
along with some suggestions
for streaks I'm trying to maintain.


158
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,759 line:-2
A person can also tap on
the "Apps" button, which is up here,


159
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,662 line:-2
to see a list of all their apps
that support shortcuts.


160
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:20,868 line:-2
For example, I can look at all the actions
that the Streaks app is offering me.


161
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,805 line:-2
There are a lot of actions here,
so let's break it down.


162
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,175 line:-1
This is based on a combination of things.


163
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:31,845 line:0
First, the actions down here
are shortcuts that were suggested


164
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,648 line:0
using INVoiceShortcutCenter, or donated.


165
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,985 line:0
Also, if the action supports
key parameters,


166
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,187 line:0
it shows up
with a row of parameter options


167
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,556 line:0
like what we see here
under "Complete Task,"


168
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,259 line:0
like "Run Five Miles" or "Study French."


169
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:49,763 line:-2
Second, the actions up here come from
intents that are marked "configurable."


170
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,532 line:-1
If your intent is configurable,


171
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,501 line:-2
it will show up
even if you don't donate or suggest it.


172
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,640 line:-2
If you want to make sure a particular set
of actions always shows up,


173
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,975 line:-1
we recommend using INVoiceShortcutCenter


174
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,746 line:-2
to set suggestions in addition to donating
user interactions in your app,


175
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,215 line:-2
just like what we talked about
for the Gallery.


176
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:11,251 line:-2
In addition to suggesting shortcuts,
donating actions,


177
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,253 line:-1
and making intents configurable,


178
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,756 line:-2
there's also one more way
to include your actions


179
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,457 line:-1
in the Shortcuts Editor.


180
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:21,028 line:-2
That is, some system intents will show up
in the Shortcuts Editor


181
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:24,531 line:-2
without having to suggest shortcuts
or donate actions.


182
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,466 line:-1
Specifically, those system intents


183
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,436 line:-2
are SendPayment, RequestPayment
and RequestRide.


184
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,506 line:-1
So, let's talk about next steps.


185
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,109 line:-2
First, consider providing
your app's actions to the system


186
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:40,047 line:-2
using INVoiceShortcutCenter's
setShortcutSuggestions API.


187
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:44,284 line:-2
Second, please donate your intents
during regular app usage


188
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,887 line:-2
so the system can learn
to feature your app in the Gallery


189
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:50,791 line:-2
as a part of automation suggestions,
and in the editor as suggested actions.


190
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:55,062 line:-2
There are more opportunities than ever
to be featured in the Shortcuts app.


191
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,563 line:-1
Thanks for watching,


192
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,701 line:-2
and we can't wait to see what shortcuts
people create with their app's actions.
