00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:06,640 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,145 line:0
Hey there. My name is Rachel,
I'm a designer from Apple Maps,


3
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,882 line:0
and I want to talk to you
about location privacy.


4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,485 line:-2
Today people share precise location data,
like this,


5
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,687 line:-1
with many of the apps that they use.


6
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:25,192 line:-2
In iOS 14, Core Location gives people
new control over their data


7
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:28,562 line:-2
by allowing them to share
their approximate location instead.


8
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,064 line:-1
This is a massive change.


9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,433 line:-1
And it blew our minds.


10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,038 line:-2
After all, our team designed Apple Maps
entirely around precise location.


11
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,807 line:0
It's the focal point of the map,


12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,578 line:0
it's used throughout the app
to find the most relevant search results


13
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:47,548 line:0
and calculate arrival times and distances,


14
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,684 line:0
and our navigation features depend on it.


15
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,453 line:-1
Location data is used everywhere,


16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,757 line:-2
and apps of all kinds will be impacted
by this change.


17
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,761 line:-2
Just here at Apple,
Weather uses location data


18
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,664 line:-1
to provide live, nearby forecasts.


19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,601 line:-2
Wallet uses location data
to match transactions to places.


20
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:11,972 line:-2
And Photos uses location data
to tag photos and create Memories.


21
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:15,509 line:-2
When our design team first heard
about approximate location,


22
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,478 line:-2
it was really hard for us to imagine
how Apple Maps could work


23
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,480 line:-1
without precise location data.


24
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:24,418 line:-2
For those of you who are feeling similarly
about your app right now,


25
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,421 line:-1
we want to share how we adapted Apple Maps


26
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,223 line:-1
to support approximate location,


27
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,525 line:-1
and in doing so improved on our approach


28
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,694 line:-1
to respecting people's data and privacy.


29
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,730 line:-2
We hope that our experience
might inform your work,


30
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,832 line:-1
no matter what kind of app you design.


31
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:42,436 line:0
If this is the first you're hearing
about approximate location,


32
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,705 line:0
consider checking out these two talks,


33
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,342 line:0
"Building Trust Through Better Privacy,"
and "What's New in Location,"


34
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,776 line:0
before continuing on.


35
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,713 line:-1
Three principles guided our team


36
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,749 line:-2
as we designed Apple Maps
for location privacy.


37
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:01,722 line:-2
First, when designing for location
privacy, prioritize user control.


38
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,192 line:-2
Give everyone control
over the location data that they share


39
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,027 line:-1
and respect their preferences.


40
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,464 line:-2
Our design team made several changes
in Apple Maps


41
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,733 line:-2
to ensure that the app works well
for people


42
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,068 line:-2
no matter what kind
of location data they share.


43
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,037 line:-1
The biggest change, and challenge,


44
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,806 line:-2
was annotating approximate location
on the map.


45
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,344 line:-2
A pulsing blue dot
represents precise location today.


46
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,647 line:-1
It is a very strong visual in our app


47
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,449 line:-2
and acts as a primary
organizational element.


48
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:33,187 line:-2
We needed a different annotation
to represent approximate data accurately,


49
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,089 line:-2
and to do so
without impeding map functionality.


50
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:41,295 line:-2
So we designed a shaded, circular area
to indicate approximate location.


51
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,265 line:-2
This new element both shares
in the visual language of the blue dot,


52
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,534 line:-1
and adapts in styling to interaction,


53
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:52,339 line:-2
so as people zoom in, the overlay fades,
to maintain cartographic legibility.


54
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,509 line:0
The design team also audited the app


55
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,612 line:0
to identify where else we use
precise location data,


56
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,481 line:0
such as to calculate arrival times
and distances,


57
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,050 line:0
like here in Favorites.


58
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:08,121 line:0
Calculating this data is not feasible
with approximate location,


59
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,726 line:0
and removing it from the user experience
does not drastically impact functionality.


60
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,628 line:0
We made small adjustments like this


61
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,331 line:0
to Search and place details as well.


62
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,768 line:-2
So, to prioritize user control
in your app,


63
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,805 line:-2
don't require precise data
to use your product.


64
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:29,076 line:-2
Allow people to do as much as possible
while sharing approximate location.


65
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,813 line:-2
And for those people
sharing approximate location,


66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,316 line:-2
remove nonessential UI
that requires precise data.


67
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,687 line:-2
Second, when designing
for location privacy,


68
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,223 line:-1
build trust through transparency.


69
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,761 line:-2
We all want to use data responsibly
and to create great user experiences.


70
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,899 line:-2
Communicate clearly with people
about what data your app uses


71
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,834 line:-1
and how that data is used.


72
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,503 line:0
In Maps, we invest in writing.


73
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,306 line:0
Clear language,
especially at important decision points,


74
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,275 line:0
like here on first app launch,


75
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,445 line:0
explains what data our app asks for
and what value it provides.


76
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:08,849 line:0
Clarity and accuracy will ensure
that people have the right knowledge


77
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,918 line:0
to make decisions
about their location data.


78
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:16,089 line:-2
Next, communicate to people
the result of their choices.


79
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:19,426 line:-2
For people who choose to share
approximate location with Apple Maps,


80
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:22,596 line:-2
we added a status bar and control
at the top of the map.


81
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,867 line:-2
When people first launch Maps,
that status appears larger


82
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,136 line:-1
and stronger in visual treatment.


83
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:31,171 line:-1
This reminds them of past decisions


84
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:34,007 line:-2
and gives them direct access
to control of the setting.


85
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,879 line:-2
Once people show interest
and interact elsewhere in the app,


86
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,415 line:-2
the visual treatment
reduces in prominence.


87
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:47,087 line:-2
This way, people still get the benefit
of persistent transparency and control,


88
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,489 line:-2
without distracting
from other functionality.


89
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,727 line:-2
So, to build trust through transparency
in your app,


90
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:58,065 line:-2
use clear writing to explain data usage
and its value proposition.


91
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,801 line:-2
Remind people
of what data they are sharing.


92
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,670 line:-2
They may be sharing location data
with multiple apps.


93
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,973 line:-1
And make your app flexible


94
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,343 line:-2
so that people can change their experience
as their needs change.


95
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,646 line:-2
Finally, when designing
for location privacy,


96
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:16,450 line:-2
offer proportional value
in exchange for the data shared.


97
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,920 line:-2
Some features will absolutely require
precise location data,


98
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,154 line:-1
and that's okay.


99
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:25,058 line:-2
Limit requests for precise data
to specific features that require it


100
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,128 line:-2
and connect your request
to value in the user experience.


101
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:32,733 line:-2
In Apple Maps, turn-by-turn directions
require precise location.


102
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,803 line:-2
So when people indicate
they want directions,


103
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,140 line:-2
we ask for one-time access
to precise location.


104
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:44,378 line:-2
And we try to ask people as close
to giving them directions as possible.


105
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,480 line:-1
For Apple Maps, this means that


106
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,582 line:-1
people sharing approximate location


107
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,218 line:-2
will still see
all the same directions buttons,


108
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,053 line:-1
like this one in place details.


109
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,822 line:0
When someone taps Directions


110
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:00,427 line:-2
they will be able to manually input
their places of origin and destination.


111
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:05,465 line:-2
Since Maps needs precise location
to auto-populate the place of origin,


112
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,035 line:-2
we add in a new option,
called My Location,


113
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,970 line:-1
to the suggested places.


114
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:13,841 line:-2
This gives people the option to create
a route from their precise location.


115
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:19,046 line:-2
When someone chooses My Location,
then we ask for their precise data.


116
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,347 line:-1
This request is connected


117
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,984 line:-2
to people taking action,
in this case, asking for directions,


118
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,354 line:-2
and is positioned close to when
they will receive those directions,


119
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:31,458 line:-2
making clear the use and value of sharing
precise location in this scenario.


120
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:36,029 line:-2
So in order to offer
proportional value in your app,


121
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:40,200 line:-2
only request precise location
when the functionality requires it.


122
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:44,238 line:-2
Make your request in response
to related action people take in your app,


123
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:48,675 line:-2
and position this request
close to the functionality it powers.


124
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:54,281 line:-2
Our team found that designing
for location privacy is very important


125
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,849 line:-1
and very possible.


126
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,886 line:-1
Just remember to prioritize user control,


127
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,890 line:-2
build trust through transparency,
and offer proportional value.


128
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,324 line:-1
With this guidance,


129
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:07,261 line:-2
we were able to support
approximate location in Apple Maps


130
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,731 line:-2
in a way that respected everyone's choices
about data sharing


131
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,066 line:-1
and maintained an elegant experience.


132
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,302 line:-2
We hope these principles
might come in handy


133
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,639 line:-2
as you develop support
for approximate location in your apps.


134
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,942 line:-1
Thanks for your time, and enjoy WWDC.
