00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:06,340 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,378 line:0
Hi. My name is Adam Humphrey,
and here at Apple,


3
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,414 line:0
I'm on a team that works with
enterprise companies all around the world


4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,251 line:0
to help them create great custom apps
for their employees.


5
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:21,388 line:0
And today, I'm happy to share some of
our knowledge to help you do the same.


6
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,957 line:-2
Apps have changed the way
we live our lives.


7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,660 line:-1
People now expect the same change at work.


8
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:30,130 line:-2
At Apple, we believe
employees should have access to apps


9
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,865 line:-1
that allow them to do their best work


10
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,800 line:-2
and fundamentally improve
how things get done.


11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,868 line:-1
So, let's begin.


12
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:37,337 line:-2
I'll start by describing some
of the characteristics


13
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,072 line:-1
that are unique to enterprise apps.


14
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,509 line:-2
Then, I'll talk about
how to find opportunities


15
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,045 line:-2
and employee roles
that are best served by custom apps.


16
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,081 line:-1
And next, I'll talk about the importance


17
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,418 line:-2
of not just including your employees
in the design and development process,


18
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,187 line:-1
but enabling them to drive it.


19
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,224 line:0
And finally, I'll talk about the tools
Apple has developed


20
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,928 line:0
to help you build custom apps quickly,
get them in the hands of your employees,


21
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,397 line:0
and continuously improve
with their feedback.


22
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,532 line:-1
All right. So, let's dive right in.


23
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,036 line:-2
First, let me talk about some of
the characteristics of an enterprise app.


24
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,073 line:-2
Simply stated,
enterprise apps are employee-facing


25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,876 line:-2
and these apps are as unique
as the employees who use them.


26
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,745 line:-1
Another characteristic is that


27
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,215 line:-2
many of them aren't found
in the public App Store.


28
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,618 line:-2
Enterprise apps
are mostly distributed internally


29
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:28,522 line:-2
by the enterprises themselves
using MDM and Apple Business Manager.


30
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,327 line:-2
Some enterprise apps
are used by a lot of employees.


31
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,896 line:-1
Like this company directory app,


32
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,332 line:-2
which allows you
to easily search for your colleagues,


33
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,235 line:-2
see their availability,
and quickly connect with them.


34
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,906 line:-2
Or this conference room app that can find
the closest available conference room


35
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:47,908 line:-2
and allows you to book it
with just one tap.


36
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,878 line:-1
And some are role-based.


37
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,380 line:-2
Tailored to very discreet
groups of employees.


38
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:59,019 line:-2
For example, this sales associate app has
specific information and unique workflows


39
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:02,389 line:-2
that helps sales associates
with clienteling, task management,


40
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,824 line:-1
corporate communications,


41
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,026 line:-2
and other workflows
they need to do their job.


42
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,461 line:-2
And still,
others are part of a group of apps


43
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,031 line:-2
that seamlessly work together
to create unique workflows


44
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,267 line:-2
that best support
many different employee jobs.


45
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,137 line:-2
For example, our sales associate app
can work with a runner app,


46
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:20,207 line:-2
which helps employees
get stock from storage locations


47
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:23,644 line:-2
and make sure they get the right item
in the fastest route possible.


48
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:27,347 line:-2
And a product catalog app that can be used
by many different employees


49
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,551 line:-2
to view new product arrivals,
inventory and availability.


50
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,253 line:-2
And these apps can share data seamlessly
between each other


51
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,688 line:-1
enabling unique workflows,


52
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:38,225 line:-2
and of course, with single sign-on,
app groups and Keychain,


53
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,326 line:-1
when you sign in to one app,


54
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,962 line:-2
you're automatically signed in
to the entire group of apps,


55
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,964 line:-1
reducing time to get things done.


56
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:48,001 line:-2
Something that all good enterprise apps
have in common:


57
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,437 line:-1
they improve an employee's job.


58
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,372 line:-1
These apps should reduce their workload


59
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,175 line:-2
and the amount of mental energy
needed to accomplish a task,


60
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:58,545 line:-2
rather than only being used
to gather data for a business.


61
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,082 line:-2
This can be as simple
as replacing a paper-based workflow,


62
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,452 line:-2
and as complex as helping a pilot
fly a state-of-the-art airplane.


63
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,354 line:-1
So now, you have a better understanding


64
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,790 line:-2
of some of the characteristics
of an enterprise app.


65
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,026 line:-2
I wanna talk to you a little bit about
some of the ways to identify


66
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:16,563 line:-2
which employees would be best served
by these types of apps.


67
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,200 line:-2
As you know, not all employees
are at their desk from nine-to-five.


68
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,236 line:-1
Some employees do their work on the go


69
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,605 line:-2
and at many different locations
during the day.


70
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,876 line:-2
These mobile employees are often helped
by apps that include way-finding,


71
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,612 line:-2
enabling them to easily navigate
to their next job.


72
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,948 line:-2
This might even include how long
it will take to get to their next job,


73
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,418 line:-2
especially when taking into account
traffic and weather conditions.


74
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:43,490 line:-2
Most enterprise apps allow people to work
even when there's no network available,


75
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,758 line:-1
and with location services,


76
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:48,028 line:-2
these apps can vastly improve
data accuracy and reporting.


77
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,930 line:-1
Power line maintenance technicians


78
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,199 line:-2
who work in very difficult
and remote terrain


79
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,767 line:-1
have benefited from these apps.


80
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,036 line:-1
At times, many miles from cell service.


81
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,805 line:-2
They replaced their heavy,
cumbersome equipment


82
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,208 line:-1
with iPads, iPhones and Apple Watches,


83
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,744 line:-2
which reduced the amount of equipment
they had to carry around.


84
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:08,182 line:-2
And the Apple Watch app enables them to do
some workflows right from their wrist,


85
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,683 line:-1
saving a lot of time and effort,


86
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,686 line:-2
and improving overall work quality
and employee satisfaction.


87
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,456 line:-2
And what about the parts of your business
that are still run primarily on paper?


88
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:21,461 line:-2
Jobs with paper-heavy processes
are often ripe with app opportunities.


89
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,331 line:-2
One industry that's experienced
this paper-to-digital transformation


90
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:25,399 line:-1
was aviation.


91
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,769 line:-2
For years, airline pilots
carried briefcases


92
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:32,439 line:-2
with reams of papers and documents
containing all their flight information.


93
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,344 line:-2
After the invention of the iPad,
some of the very first pilot apps


94
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,881 line:-2
enabled pilots to store thousands
of charts and documents on an iPad,


95
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,550 line:-2
instead of paper
carried in their large briefcase.


96
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:47,187 line:-2
These apps had huge impact
on all types of pilots.


97
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:50,891 line:-2
From international commercial pilots
all the way to flight instructors.


98
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,861 line:-2
The positive impacts of these apps
was felt industry-wide.


99
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:59,533 line:-2
Now, some employees, they carry around
scanners, cameras, GPS devices,


100
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,869 line:-2
measuring devices,
audio and video recorders.


101
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,173 line:-2
These are all often great opportunities
for an enterprise app.


102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,710 line:-2
The iPhone and iPad are extremely
sophisticated pieces of hardware.


103
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,313 line:-2
An insurance claims adjuster
used to carry around a laptop,


104
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,884 line:-2
a voice recorder,
a tape measure, a digital camera.


105
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,319 line:-2
With an app
designed specific for their workflow,


106
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,456 line:-2
now they can do the majority of their work
right on an iPad.


107
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,791 line:-1
Sometimes it's extremely helpful


108
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,027 line:-2
for an employee
to action on something right away


109
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:31,431 line:-2
without the need to make a phone call,
send an email or even launch an app.


110
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,435 line:-2
There are incredible opportunities for you
to create simple but powerful workflows


111
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,004 line:-1
by customizing notifications.


112
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,575 line:-2
By using notification content extensions,
you can create custom workflows


113
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,711 line:-2
that an employee can use
right from within the notification,


114
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,881 line:-2
making some workflows
as easy as a glance and a tap.


115
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:51,084 line:-2
When corporate pilots saw this,
they were ecstatic.


116
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:55,422 line:-2
This simple rich notification shows
leg information and weather conditions


117
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,558 line:-2
and with a glance,
the pilots can easily know


118
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,894 line:-2
if they would be home for dinner
or if they would be gone for a day or two.


119
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,996 line:-2
Not to mention
what clothes they should pack.


120
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,598 line:-1
Without the need to launch the app,


121
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,201 line:-2
they can quickly accept or decline
new trip assignments


122
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,169 line:-1
right from this rich notification.


123
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,804 line:-1
And with notification extensions,


124
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:14,274 line:-2
the company dispatchers know which pilots
have received these notifications.


125
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,843 line:-1
This is especially useful


126
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,212 line:-2
if your workforce
is flying all around the globe


127
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,880 line:-1
and not always connected to a network.


128
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,049 line:-1
And speaking of networks


129
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,751 line:-2
with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
and cellular networks,


130
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,220 line:-1
you can create processes


131
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:29,223 line:-2
that allow multiple employees
to collaborate effortlessly.


132
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:35,395 line:-2
With iPad, inspectors can seamlessly
work together deep in subway tunnels,


133
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,297 line:-1
even without cellular connectivity,


134
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,234 line:-2
using technologies like Bluetooth
and iBeacon.


135
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,536 line:-1
Teams can streamline inspections quickly,


136
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:46,807 line:-2
accessing information required to locate,
identify and complete inspections.


137
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:51,979 line:-2
These are just a few of the examples of
great opportunities for enterprise apps.


138
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:55,082 line:-2
Start looking for these opportunities
in your own organization


139
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:59,553 line:-2
and allow the people doing the actual work
to drive the process of design.


140
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,921 line:-1
Let's talk about that now.


141
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:04,057 line:-2
It's incredibly important
to allow the employees who do the job


142
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,260 line:-1
to drive the design process.


143
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,896 line:-2
And that usually starts
with interviewing them


144
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,531 line:-1
and observing them in their jobs.


145
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,000 line:-1
Try to understand their pain points,


146
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,469 line:-2
the blockers that keep them
from doing their best work.


147
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,005 line:-1
You should seek a diversity of input


148
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,307 line:-2
by interviewing an employee
who's new to the role,


149
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,277 line:-2
a veteran employee,
and an employee somewhere in between.


150
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,281 line:-2
Bring in these employees together
and interview them at the same time.


151
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:30,050 line:-2
This way, you give them
the opportunity to dialogue


152
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,020 line:-2
about their different perspectives
of the work they do.


153
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:36,390 line:-2
You then use these rich insights
to inform the app you build.


154
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,392 line:-1
You'll find that the veteran employee


155
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,628 line:-2
may have their own workarounds
based on years of experience.


156
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:45,499 line:-2
And the new employee, they may have
recently gone through employee training


157
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,535 line:-2
and they can share how the process
is supposed to be done by the book,


158
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,572 line:-2
and they'll point out
where processes are difficult to learn


159
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,507 line:-1
and where an app might make it easier.


160
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,578 line:-2
You might be encouraged
to involve a manager,


161
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,746 line:-1
a director or a subject matter expert


162
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,883 line:-2
instead of the actual employees
who do the job day in and day out.


163
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,686 line:-1
Instead, prioritize direct experience


164
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:09,423 line:-2
and get the details from the people
who actually fly the plane, so to speak,


165
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,092 line:-2
rather than relying on the input
from employees


166
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,529 line:-2
who can be more focused
on the ideal or approved process


167
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,365 line:-2
rather than the realities of the job
that needs to be done.


168
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,501 line:-1
This even includes those managers


169
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:24,271 line:-2
who used to be on the job for many years
before they became a manager.


170
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,441 line:-2
Stick with the employees who,
if they weren't talking to you,


171
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:28,942 line:-1
would be doing the actual work.


172
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,078 line:-1
It's also very important


173
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,746 line:-2
to get a holistic understanding
of the employee's role.


174
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,316 line:-2
Have them talk about
a standard day in their life.


175
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,721 line:-2
Have them discuss their entire day,
not just the nine-to-five.


176
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:44,558 line:-2
Sometimes, you'll find work gets done
over their morning coffee.


177
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,827 line:-2
Including their entire day
in your discussion


178
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:51,031 line:-2
enables you to find blockers that may not
be obvious once they are on the job.


179
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,268 line:-2
This will help you understand
what features go into this app


180
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,670 line:-1
and where other opportunities lie.


181
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,773 line:-2
You may even find you weren't solving
their biggest pain points.


182
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,309 line:-2
We once started interviewing
a sales associate


183
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,144 line:-1
for a new mobile point-of-sale app,


184
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,079 line:-1
and during the course of that interview,


185
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,949 line:-2
we discovered all their immediate needs
were in clienteling,


186
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,484 line:-1
not the point-of-sale.


187
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,985 line:-1
This allowed us to pivot early


188
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,721 line:-2
and ultimately create an app
with much greater impact.


189
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:16,723 line:-1
All right.


190
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,426 line:-2
So, now you have a holistic understanding
of the employee's work


191
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:22,162 line:-2
and have confidence
you've focused on the right problem.


192
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,931 line:-1
It's time to dive into the details.


193
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,867 line:-2
Understanding the exact steps
in an employee's workflow


194
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,969 line:-2
and getting to
the root of their challenges


195
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,972 line:-2
is key to truly designing an app
that improves their work.


196
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,776 line:-2
Be sure to qualify the response
with the others who do the same job.


197
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,578 line:-1
For example, you can say,


198
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,347 line:-2
"Hey, Dan, what Rebecca just said
about tracking mileage,


199
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,016 line:-2
is that the same for you
or do you track mileage differently?"


200
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,053 line:-2
I wanna talk about
a few very important tips


201
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,088 line:-1
that can really have a positive impact


202
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:51,024 line:-2
on the information you get from
your employees during these interviews.


203
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,995 line:-2
Make sure it's a safe place
for open communication


204
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,531 line:-2
with no managers
to influence their responses.


205
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,733 line:-1
You want the unvarnished truth.


206
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,870 line:-2
When an employee changes their answer
to that of a manager,


207
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,606 line:-2
or is watching their manager
for validation,


208
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,608 line:-2
you can be assured
you're not getting the whole truth.


209
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:11,078 line:-2
You are there to gain insight
and help improve their lives at work.


210
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,813 line:-1
Sometimes, you might catch yourself


211
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,749 line:-2
subconsciously filling in the details
as they tell you their story.


212
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,285 line:-1
Don't assume anything.


213
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,321 line:-2
Always ask for clarification
when things seem vague.


214
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:24,224 line:-2
Hey, even ask for clarification
if things seem obvious.


215
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,226 line:-2
You'll be surprised
how much of what you infer


216
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,895 line:-1
ends up being way off the mark.


217
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:33,734 line:-2
And don't forget to constantly ask why.
Continue to ask clarifying questions.


218
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,769 line:-2
Remember that the majority
of the employees will be stuck


219
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:38,705 line:-2
in what they want to fix
in their current workflows today


220
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,441 line:-2
and it isn't always easy for them
to step back


221
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,978 line:-2
and look at the larger problem,
or even recognize that there is a problem.


222
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:48,515 line:-2
Not to mention, imagine the future state
when they have the app.


223
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:51,118 line:-2
For example, think about
how store managers


224
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:54,188 line:-2
may not be able to talk about
a future state of shift scheduling


225
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,991 line:-2
until their sales associates are able to
swap shifts in a sales associate app.


226
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,094 line:-1
And the final and most important tip,


227
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,064 line:-2
you must always have empathy
for the employees you interview.


228
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,968 line:-2
You are there to get all the information
you need to solve their problems


229
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,470 line:-2
and allow them
to drive the design process.


230
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:14,741 line:-2
Put yourself in their shoes
and try your best to feel their pain.


231
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,579 line:-2
I once interviewed an employee
for a large transportation company


232
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,548 line:-2
and he was so ecstatic
to have an empathetic ear to talk to.


233
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:24,918 line:-2
He said in his 30-plus years of working
at that company,


234
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,154 line:-2
this was the very first time
he truly felt like


235
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:28,755 line:-1
his knowledge and experience


236
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,758 line:-2
was going to improve the work
of his colleagues all around the world.


237
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,527 line:-1
That really hit home.


238
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:35,195 line:-1
So, what next?


239
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,998 line:-2
The fastest way to get an app
in the hands of your employees


240
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,167 line:-2
is to optimize
your design and development time.


241
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,569 line:-1
Developing and testing in Xcode


242
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:45,572 line:-2
is the fastest way to decrease time
to a deployment.


243
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,575 line:-2
Apple provides you
with very powerful tools in Xcode


244
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,177 line:-1
to build and test apps.


245
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:53,313 line:-2
Use these to streamline
your development and testing activities


246
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,783 line:-2
and get the app in the hands
of your employees as quickly as possible.


247
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,686 line:-2
Gone are the days of three-year design
and development cycles


248
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:03,423 line:-2
for a single, gigantic app
that tries to be everything to everyone.


249
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,594 line:-2
Small and focused, and always evolving
is the ticket to creating solutions


250
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,264 line:-2
that continually improve
and adjust to changing roles.


251
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:12,866 line:-1
Using standard views and controls


252
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,435 line:-2
can save you
a lot of design and development time.


253
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:19,339 line:-2
And these design patterns are easily
recognized and understood by Apple users,


254
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,876 line:-2
so the need for training and support
is greatly reduced.


255
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,846 line:-2
This doesn't mean your app
can't be beautiful or elegant.


256
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,914 line:-1
On the contrary.


257
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,950 line:-2
It just means try to keep custom controls
to a minimum,


258
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,385 line:-1
so your users don't have to learn


259
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,588 line:-2
a whole bunch of new interactions
or navigation paradigms


260
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:35,822 line:-1
when they first use your app.


261
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,991 line:-1
Next, keep it focused.


262
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,093 line:-2
It's perfectly okay to create
a focused app


263
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,196 line:-2
that delivers
initial value for your employees


264
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,732 line:-2
and later grows to add
many more features and workflows.


265
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,102 line:-2
Bottom line, keep your app focused
and always evolving.


266
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:52,906 line:-2
This is the best way to make sure your app
is always useful to your employees.


267
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,643 line:-2
And please, don't forget
to leverage tools like TestFlight.


268
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,179 line:-2
TestFlight helps you
beta test versions of your app


269
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,782 line:-2
and get constant feedback
from your employees.


270
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,851 line:-2
Not only when you're building
the first release,


271
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,187 line:-2
but also when you start adding
additional features and workflows.


272
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:11,391 line:-2
And remember, your employees
should be driving the design process.


273
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,229 line:-2
So, continue to get feedback from them
as you design and develop your app.


274
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:21,001 line:-2
Does this app solve their problems?
If not, continue to iterate until it does.


275
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,403 line:-2
If it does, what can you do
to make it even better?


276
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,773 line:-2
You'll quickly learn what features
or apps to build next.


277
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,077 line:-2
This allows your organization
to organically build product roadmaps


278
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,214 line:-2
and continually iterate apps to adjust
to changing roles and responsibilities.


279
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,551 line:-2
Remember my earlier example
about pilots using iPads


280
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:39,553 line:-2
to replace their paper charts
and documents?


281
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,657 line:-2
Those same apps today,
they are very sophisticated


282
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:46,527 line:-2
and some even use data
from planes' avionic systems


283
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,997 line:-2
to create custom real-time procedures
based on that information.


284
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,866 line:-2
It's amazing
how far these apps have evolved


285
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,035 line:-2
with constant feedback
from the pilots that use them.


286
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,739 line:-2
Throughout this session, we've reviewed
employee app characteristics


287
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,575 line:-2
and how they help your employees
do their best work,


288
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:03,644 line:-1
found key areas for app opportunities


289
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,014 line:-2
such as mobile employees
and paper processes,


290
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,450 line:-2
walked through the ways you can have
your employees drive the design process


291
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,452 line:-1
to ensure your apps are impactful...


292
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,191 line:-2
and finally, how to quickly build
and release your app


293
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,226 line:-1
and then, keep improving them over time.


294
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,595 line:-2
These learnings
will help you on your journey


295
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,965 line:-2
designing and developing
great custom apps for your employees.


296
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,134 line:-2
We can't wait to see
what you come up with.


297
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:31,505 line:-2
And please know the work you do,
these apps you create,


298
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:34,174 line:-2
they can fundamentally improve
the lives of your employees at work.


299
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:38,679 line:-2
Trust me. I've seen it many times before
and it's always inspiring.


300
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,915 line:-2
I wish you luck, thank you,
and have a great WWDC.
