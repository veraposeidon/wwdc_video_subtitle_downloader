Hello and welcome to WWDC.


3
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,478 line:0
Hi. Welcome to designing great App Clips.


4
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,881 line:0
I'm Grant Paul from the Apple Design Team,


5
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,783 line:0
and I'm gonna be joined shortly
by my colleague Heena Ko.


6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,153 line:-2
Today we're gonna talk about
all of the pieces that you need


7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,422 line:-1
in order to design great App Clips.


8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,259 line:-2
I hope you're as excited
about App Clips as we are.


9
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,360 line:-1
So, let's get started.


10
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,329 line:-2
First off, we're gonna go into
a little bit more detail


11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,465 line:-1
about what exactly App Clips are


12
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,067 line:-2
and how they relate
to the apps that you already have.


13
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:38,071 line:-2
Then we're gonna talk about
how people actually get into App Clips,


14
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,742 line:-2
since unlike with apps, they don't start
by going to the App Store.


15
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,680 line:-2
And finally we'll talk about what features
should go into a great App Clip


16
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:50,350 line:-2
and what you need to know in order
to design your user interfaces for them.


17
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:52,953 line:-1
So, what are App Clips?


18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,255 line:-2
App Clips are lightweight
versions of apps.


19
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,958 line:-1
They offer some of an app's functionality


20
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,494 line:-2
and they offer it
when and where people need it.


21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,063 line:-1
They're fully native experiences


22
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,967 line:-2
and they use all of the same technologies
that you already know from your apps.


23
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,904 line:-2
And since App Clips are lightweight,
you can use them instantly.


24
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:13,774 line:-2
You don't have to download
or install an app at all.


25
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,578 line:-2
In fact, App Clips are meant for people
who haven't downloaded your app yet.


26
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,313 line:-1
They might not even know what it is.


27
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,584 line:-2
Now, unlike apps, which you usually get
by browsing or searching in the App Store,


28
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,552 line:-2
App Clips show up
right when you need them.


29
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,422 line:-2
They're found through codes
and tags out in the world,


30
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,159 line:-2
including some new codes
that we've designed just for App Clips.


31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,663 line:-2
App Clips can also come from
places and apps that are built into iOS.


32
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,398 line:-1
Things like Maps and Safari.


33
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,935 line:-2
We're gonna talk more in a little bit
about some best practices


34
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,505 line:-2
for when your App Clips show up
in each of these places.


35
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,206 line:-1
Now, last but not least,


36
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,142 line:-2
App Clips don't stick around
when you're done using them.


37
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,945 line:-2
Once you swipe an App Clip away,
you're done with it.


38
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,815 line:-2
You don't need to manage it
or clear it out to save space


39
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,350 line:-1
or delete it off your device.


40
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,218 line:-1
It's all gonna be handled for you.


41
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,388 line:-2
And if you do need an App Clip again,
you can always just get back to it


42
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,724 line:-2
the same way
that you got there in the first place.


43
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,059 line:-1
But if you want faster access,


44
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,395 line:-2
you can download that App Clip's
corresponding app to your Home Screen


45
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,332 line:-2
and that'll be able to do
everything the App Clip does,


46
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,469 line:-2
as well as some extra things
that only the app can do.


47
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,371 line:-1
So, that's what App Clips are.


48
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,007 line:-1
Let's talk about what they look like.


49
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,977 line:-2
Of course, this here is an app icon,
which should be pretty familiar by now.


50
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,682 line:-2
And this is what that app icon looks like
as an App Clip.


51
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:32,352 line:-2
And that border is generated automatically
from the icon you provide,


52
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,021 line:-1
so when you're making your app icon,


53
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,424 line:-2
there's nothing special at all
that you need to do for App Clips.


54
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,061 line:-2
So, here's what it looks like
to use an App Clip in practice.


55
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,597 line:-2
Let's say you tap your phone
to an NFC tag.


56
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,234 line:0
You'll instantly get an App Clip card


57
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:51,471 line:0
with information that tells you all about
what the App Clip is and what it can do.


58
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:55,375 line:0
And if you want to use the App Clip,
all you need to do is tap "Open."


59
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,413 line:0
And once you tap "Open,"
the App Clip card slides off,


60
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,416 line:-2
the App Clip finishes loading,
and you're all ready to go.


61
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,086 line:-2
That's how easy it is
and how fast it is to use an App Clip.


62
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,489 line:-1
And App Clips can be used for anything.


63
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,659 line:-2
We're gonna cover
a bunch of ideas in this session


64
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:16,630 line:-2
of different categories and different
use cases that you can use App Clips for.


65
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,666 line:-2
What we're even more excited about
than any of those


66
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,102 line:-2
are all of the ideas
that we've never thought of,


67
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,738 line:-1
that developers, that you, are gonna make.


68
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,975 line:-2
It's just like all of the incredible,
creative, and amazing apps


69
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,576 line:-1
that we've seen on the App Store.


70
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,614 line:-2
We hope that App Clips are gonna open up
places that weren't possible before


71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,216 line:-1
and spur new ideas, just like apps did.


72
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:41,121 line:0
One of those places that App Clips
can open up is for small businesses.


73
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:44,291 line:-2
Now, small businesses often
don't have the resources


74
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,460 line:-1
to make an entire app by themselves.


75
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,763 line:-2
So instead,
the small businesses usually show up


76
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,934 line:-2
as a small part of a bigger app
that's under a different brand.


77
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,537 line:0
Think about an app
for delivering ice cream.


78
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,473 line:0
So, to order
from an ice cream shop in this app,


79
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,510 line:0
you need to go into the delivery app first
and then find the shop that you want.


80
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,915 line:-2
But what people wanna do is to interact
with the business that they already know.


81
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,551 line:-2
They don't wanna download
and learn about another app


82
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,386 line:-1
just in order to order their ice cream.


83
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,854 line:0
App Clips can help.


84
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:18,125 line:0
When you have an App Clip, you make a
custom experience for the small business.


85
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,062 line:0
An experience that uses
that small business's own branding,


86
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,865 line:0
along with some attribution
back to the App Clip.


87
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,702 line:0
That lets the experience feel like
it's coming from that small business.


88
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,339 line:0
So, we're really excited to see


89
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:36,310 line:-2
how this can bring the power of App Clips
and bring the power of apps


90
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,946 line:-2
to more businesses
where they couldn't work before.


91
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,216 line:-2
So, that's what App Clips are
and what they're for.


92
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,086 line:-2
Now I wanna talk about how you find
App Clips and how you get into them.


93
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,989 line:-1
As I mentioned before, unlike with apps,


94
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,859 line:-2
you don't find App Clips
by going to the App Store


95
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,928 line:-2
and searching for them by name
or browsing through categories.


96
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:58,732 line:-2
Instead, the way you find App Clips
is in context.


97
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,435 line:-2
You find them
right when and where you need them.


98
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:05,072 line:-2
And one of the ways that you do that
is through physical tags.


99
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,475 line:-2
Now, App Clips support
many different kinds of physical tags.


100
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:13,080 line:-2
They support our new App Clip codes,
they support other kinds of NFC tags,


101
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,516 line:-2
and they also support
your standard QR codes.


102
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,417 line:0
These new App Clip codes


103
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,888 line:0
are the most visible way
for people to get into App Clips.


104
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:25,359 line:0
They have a consistent appearance,
so they can become instantly recognizable


105
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,829 line:0
as leading to a great App Clip experience
once you scan it.


106
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,533 line:-2
And when people see one,
because they're instantly recognizable,


107
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,835 line:-2
they'll know
exactly what to do right away.


108
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,571 line:0
Now, these codes are also flexible.


109
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,073 line:0
In the middle there's an NFC tag,


110
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,177 line:0
which you can use
just by holding your iPhone up to the tag.


111
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,480 line:0
And there's a visual code
on the outside around it,


112
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,849 line:0
which can be useful
if you can't get up close.


113
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:52,586 line:0
Maybe 'cause the code is on a billboard
or a poster or it's just out of reach.


114
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:53,754 line:-1
Something like that.


115
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,190 line:-2
And this is
what they look like physically.


116
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,892 line:-2
You can see how the App Clip code
is placed on the table


117
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,895 line:-2
so it's easy to see and notice
right when you need it.


118
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,765 line:-2
We're gonna have
some more information available soon


119
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,235 line:-2
on how you can make and place
your own App Clip codes.


120
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,405 line:-2
A really important part
of using any kind of physical tag


121
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,075 line:-2
is to use a different tag
for each way into your App Clip.


122
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:18,011 line:0
So, let's say
a coffee shop has four locations.


123
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,714 line:0
If you go to the location in Cupertino,


124
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:24,484 line:0
it should use a different tag
than all of the other locations.


125
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,486 line:-1
That way the App Clip can know


126
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,690 line:-2
to show the menu
for the Cupertino location automatically,


127
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,892 line:-2
rather than making you
have to pick a location first.


128
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:36,096 line:0
You can also use different tags
from within a location.


129
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,333 line:0
For example,
each table at the Cupertino shop


130
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,134 line:-1
could have a different tag on it.


131
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,638 line:-2
So, the App Clip automatically knows
not just which location you're at,


132
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,341 line:0
but also which table
that your order should go to.


133
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,944 line:-2
It saves a step.
This makes your App Clip faster.


134
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,146 line:-1
But it also means that there's no chance


135
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,816 line:-2
that someone's gonna
accidentally pick the wrong location


136
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,784 line:-1
or pick the wrong table in your App Clip


137
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,053 line:-2
because it's all handled
for them automatically.


138
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,556 line:-1
Now, in addition to placing physical tags,


139
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,759 line:-2
you can also
attach App Clips to locations.


140
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,997 line:0
If you do that for your App Clip,
it might start showing up in Maps,


141
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:14,201 line:0
which lets people use the App Clip before
they actually get to the place itself.


142
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:17,337 line:0
For example, a food app
like Panera Bread here,


143
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,907 line:0
can let you preorder
or can let you order takeout


144
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,476 line:0
before you actually
go over to that location.


145
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,746 line:-2
And if an App Clip ends up being
especially useful


146
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,448 line:-2
or popular and relevant
in a specific place,


147
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,619 line:-2
it can get selected to show up
automatically in Siri Suggestions.


148
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,455 line:-2
That means both in the widget
on the home screen


149
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,658 line:-1
and in Siri Suggestions in Spotlight.


150
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,328 line:-2
That way, people can start
getting into your App Clip


151
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:46,200 line:-2
without having to scan anything first
or even find a tag or a code to get in.


152
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:50,237 line:-2
So, that's how you can get into App Clips
from physical tags and from locations.


153
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,905 line:-1
Next, I wanna talk about


154
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,509 line:-2
getting to App Clips
from different places on your device.


155
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,179 line:-2
Now, some App Clip experiences
don't have a physical location


156
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:03,217 line:-2
that makes sense to put tags or that
they could be associated with in Maps.


157
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,285 line:-1
And that's totally great too.


158
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:09,523 line:-2
App Clips are gonna work just as well
with experiences that are totally virtual


159
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:12,392 line:-2
and that take place
entirely on the device.


160
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,396 line:-2
So, the way that you find
those App Clip experiences


161
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,899 line:-1
is from the Smart App Banner in Safari.


162
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,869 line:-2
If you have a website
and you also have an App Clip,


163
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,972 line:-2
you can add a Smart App Banner
to the top of your page.


164
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,575 line:-2
And if you do, people can start
going straight into your App Clip


165
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,277 line:-1
as soon as they press the button.


166
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,679 line:-1
So, for example, what you see here.


167
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,549 line:-2
Etsy can put a Smart App Banner
on their detail page


168
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,619 line:-1
to jump right into their App Clip.


169
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,855 line:-2
And, of course,
if someone has their app installed,


170
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,091 line:-2
the banner will take people
to the app instead.


171
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,159 line:-2
So they can get
all of the features of the app


172
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,061 line:-1
in addition to what the App Clip can do.


173
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,498 line:-2
So, when would you show
a Smart App Banner in Safari


174
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:54,401 line:-2
versus having people, for example,
just use your website?


175
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,637 line:-1
Well, there's two main reasons.


176
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,007 line:-2
One of them is that
when you make an App Clip,


177
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,575 line:-1
just like when you make an app,


178
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:05,479 line:-2
it's often gonna be a better experience
than what you'll find on a website.


179
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,981 line:-1
App Clips use native system controls,


180
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,385 line:-2
so people already know how to use them
and they're faster to learn.


181
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:16,323 line:-2
And of course, just like apps,
App Clips are really fast and responsive.


182
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,660 line:-1
It's really the same great user experience


183
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,463 line:-2
that's why people go to the App Store
to download your apps today.


184
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:29,102 line:-2
Now, the second reason is that
App Clips enable new types of experiences


185
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,573 line:-2
that are either hard or impossible
to make on the Web


186
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,509 line:-2
but with apps
are really common and easy to do.


187
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,679 line:-2
For example, think of something
like recording and editing a video.


188
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,314 line:-1
It's not common on the Web,


189
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,884 line:-2
but with the power of the iOS frameworks,
it's simple to do in your app.


190
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:48,155 line:-2
Similarly, you can do things
like connect to a device with Bluetooth


191
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:51,291 line:-2
or show interactive 3D scenes
in augmented reality.


192
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:56,129 line:-2
App Clips have all of the power of apps
available to you right away.


193
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,167 line:-2
And just like with physical tags,
when you use a Smart App Banner,


194
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:03,971 line:-2
it's important to launch into the right
part of your App Clip automatically.


195
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:09,443 line:-2
So, in this example, Etsy would launch
right into the part of their App Clip


196
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,812 line:-2
for the product
being shown in Safari below.


197
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,181 line:-1
That saves people from having to navigate


198
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:16,917 line:-2
back to that product
from inside the App Clip.


199
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:21,288 line:-2
There's also one last place
that you might see App Clips.


200
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,323 line:-1
If you have a page with a Smart App Banner


201
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,692 line:-2
and you share a link
to that page in Messages,


202
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,396 line:-2
people can go directly from Messages
right into the App Clip.


203
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,131 line:-1
And what's great about that


204
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:34,768 line:-2
is that people can start sharing
your App Clip with the people they know,


205
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,871 line:-2
which lets people
organically discover your App Clip


206
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,140 line:-1
and also discover your app through it.


207
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:44,845 line:-2
So, that's the Smart App Banner in Safari
and how it ties into Messages.


208
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:49,183 line:-2
Now, the next step
after you find an App Clip is to use it.


209
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,685 line:-1
And every time you use an App Clip,


210
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:54,588 line:-2
the first thing you're gonna see
is the App Clip card.


211
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,458 line:-2
The App Clip card is like
the product page in the App Store.


212
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:02,396 line:-2
It's your chance to show off
what it is that your App Clip can do,


213
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,798 line:-1
to introduce your App Clip to people,


214
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,401 line:-2
and to let people know
why they should start using it.


215
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,704 line:-2
So, let's say you tap your phone
on an App Clip code.


216
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,042 line:0
As with all of the other ways
that you can get into an App Clip,


217
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,778 line:0
the first thing you're gonna see
is the App Clip card.


218
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:21,048 line:-2
All App Clip cards
have the same general shape


219
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,684 line:-2
but they have a few different parts
that you can customize.


220
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,820 line:-2
Let's look at the different pieces
and how you can customize them.


221
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:31,758 line:-2
So, the most important part of your
App Clip card to customize is the title.


222
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,762 line:-2
The title is what tells people
what your App Clip is.


223
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,664 line:-1
Now, for most App Clips,


224
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:41,535 line:-2
this is gonna be the same as the name
of your app or the name of your brand.


225
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:46,039 line:-2
Now, sometimes it can be worth using
a more specific title for your App Clip.


226
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,910 line:-2
If your App Clip focuses
on a single feature out of your app,


227
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,546 line:-2
you can use that feature
as part of your title.


228
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:56,183 line:-2
For example here,
if you have a music listening app,


229
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,819 line:-2
but your App Clip for it
is all about radio,


230
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:02,389 line:-2
you might put "radio" in as part
of the App Clip experience's title.


231
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,659 line:-2
Now, if the title
is the brand of your App Clip,


232
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:09,963 line:-2
the subtitle is where you get to explain
what it is that your App Clip does.


233
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:12,566 line:-2
Remember that when people
are using your App Clip,


234
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:15,602 line:-2
it's often gonna be the first time
they're having any interaction


235
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,471 line:-1
with your app or with your brand,


236
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,640 line:-2
so they might not know
what your name means.


237
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,341 line:-1
They're gonna need an explanation


238
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,744 line:-2
of what it is that your App Clip
is there to do,


239
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,612 line:-2
and that's what you can put
in the subtitle.


240
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,948 line:-1
Next up is the header image.


241
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:31,185 line:-2
Now, the header image
is your chance to show visually


242
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,453 line:-2
what it is that you can get
out of your App Clip.


243
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,023 line:-2
If your App Clip is attached
to something physical,


244
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,525 line:-1
like a real-world location or a service,


245
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,361 line:-2
a photo of that location
or of that service


246
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,096 line:-1
can make for a great header image.


247
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,732 line:-2
But if it's not attached
to anything physical,


248
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,734 line:-2
you can always make
a great graphic version


249
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,103 line:-1
of your logo or some part of your brand.


250
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:54,007 line:-2
Either way, you should always stick
to either a photograph


251
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,876 line:-1
or some kind of custom graphic.


252
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,911 line:-1
You should never use screenshots


253
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,780 line:-1
or fill it up with lots of text


254
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,115 line:-2
since both of those
can be really hard to read


255
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,385 line:-2
in the small space available
on your App Clip card.


256
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:09,857 line:-2
Now, after the header image,
there's one more piece you can customize.


257
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,092 line:-2
The button on the right
of the App Clip card


258
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,595 line:-2
represents the action
that people are gonna take


259
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,964 line:-2
when they open up your App Clip
on their device.


260
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:21,802 line:-2
So, right now we have three options
available to you for the action button,


261
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,171 line:-1
Open, View and Play.


262
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,673 line:-1
Now, if you're making a general App Clip,


263
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,976 line:-2
the usual one
that you're gonna pick is Open.


264
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,644 line:-1
It's the default choice.


265
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,714 line:-2
But if you have an App Clip
that's all about showing information


266
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,885 line:-2
or visualizing something,
the View action can be a good one to pick.


267
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:42,222 line:-2
And, of course, Play is great
for things like media and games.


268
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,825 line:-2
Now, beyond these three,
we're looking to hear


269
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:48,328 line:-2
what additional action labels
would be useful to you.


270
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,664 line:-2
So as you come up with ideas
for App Clips,


271
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:54,067 line:-2
let us know in Feedback Assistant
what else we could add.


272
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:57,004 line:0
Finally, at the bottom
of the App Clip card


273
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,474 line:0
is the attribution back to the App Clip's
corresponding app.


274
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,243 line:0
Tapping in here takes you to the App Store


275
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,280 line:0
so you can get the app
or you can see more information about it,


276
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,116 line:0
like who developed it
or what the privacy policy is.


277
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:13,754 line:0
If you wanna customize this section,
that means changing your app's metadata.


278
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:17,157 line:-1
So, that's how people discover App Clips.


279
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:20,093 line:-2
It can be from physical tags
like our App Clip codes,


280
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,362 line:-1
NFC tags and QR codes.


281
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,666 line:-1
You can use the Smart App Banner in Safari


282
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:29,269 line:-2
to offer your App Clip when it has
a new or a better experience


283
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,271 line:-1
than what you can get from the web page.


284
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:36,009 line:-2
You should make sure to launch
into the right part of your App Clip


285
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:40,547 line:-2
to skip unnecessary navigation
when the context is already clear


286
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:44,585 line:-2
from the specific tag or page
that the App Clip is coming from.


287
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:49,556 line:-2
And finally, make sure to be thoughtful
in how you introduce people


288
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,326 line:-1
to your App Clip on your App Clip card.


289
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,562 line:-2
You should use clear language
and great imagery.


290
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,131 line:-2
Now that you have a sense
of what App Clips are


291
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,368 line:-2
and how you get into them,
I'll hand it over to my colleague Heena


292
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:05,138 line:-2
to talk about how to design the content
for inside your App Clips.


293
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,975 line:0
Hi, my name is Heena,
and I'll be talking to you today


294
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,176 line:0
about designing App Clips.


295
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:12,713 line:-2
Let's first talk about what goes into
a great App Clip.


296
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,483 line:-2
So, the most important thing to remember
is that great App Clips are simple.


297
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,953 line:-2
Their focused experience
is made for accomplishing a task.


298
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,688 line:-1
Great App Clips are fast.


299
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,257 line:-1
Not only are they quick to load,


300
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,159 line:-2
the flow should be as quick
and streamlined as possible.


301
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,362 line:-2
So, when you're about
to create an App Clip,


302
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,230 line:-1
you wanna have three main things in mind.


303
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,699 line:-1
First, decide what the purpose is.


304
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,135 line:-2
Whether it's renting a scooter
or buying ice cream,


305
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:38,338 line:-2
think about the single task
your App Clip accomplishes.


306
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,809 line:-2
Second, think about what
the absolute minimum flow is


307
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:44,511 line:-1
to accomplish that task.


308
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,880 line:-2
Remember, App Clips are
in-the-moment experiences,


309
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,316 line:-2
so the flow should be
focused and efficient.


310
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:50,751 line:-1
Consider using technologies


311
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,555 line:-2
like Apple Pay and Sign in with Apple
for a more seamless experience.


312
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:59,259 line:0
Lastly, you can offer
the full app for more features.


313
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,695 line:0
Remember, App Clips
should be useful in isolation,


314
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,965 line:0
but if you wanna offer it, we made
something so you can do that easily.


315
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,301 line:-1
Okay, so let's walk through some examples.


316
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,737 line:-2
Let's say you're making
an App Clip for a café


317
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,973 line:-2
where you can order ahead
to get coffee to go.


318
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,144 line:-2
The minimum flow here could include
the ability to browse the menu and order.


319
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,581 line:-1
Then pay for your coffee with Apple Pay.


320
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:23,650 line:-1
Then after the transaction's complete


321
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,053 line:-2
and you've demonstrated
the value of your App Clip,


322
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,121 line:-1
you could offer to download the full app.


323
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,257 line:-1
It's important here to clearly explain


324
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,860 line:-2
the additional benefits
that the full app offers.


325
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,195 line:-1
This next example's a parking app


326
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:38,599 line:-2
that allows you to pay for a parking space
in various parking garages.


327
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,369 line:0
The minimum flow here could be to provide


328
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:45,772 line:0
the ability to pay for your parking space
for a certain amount of time.


329
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:50,177 line:0
Then you could send a notification
saying that the time is about to expire.


330
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:53,313 line:0
Tapping on that notification


331
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,115 line:0
could allow you
to extend your time remotely


332
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,217 line:0
so you don't have to walk
back to your car.


333
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,786 line:-1
Okay, let's move on to this next example.


334
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,656 line:-2
Let's say you're setting up
an online store, like this one


335
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:04,358 line:-1
where you can shop for accessories.


336
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:08,896 line:-2
The flow here could include
a simple shopping experience


337
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:11,164 line:-2
where you can browse
and add items to a shopping cart.


338
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,935 line:-2
After the transaction's complete,
you could offer Sign in with Apple


339
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:19,506 line:-2
so folks can get notified of sales
and save their favorite items.


340
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,276 line:-2
This is an example
of a restaurant App Clip


341
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,810 line:-2
that allows you to order and pay
right from your table.


342
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,481 line:-2
It's important to note
that this kind of experience


343
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:30,250 line:-2
requires that you distribute
unique App Clip codes


344
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,653 line:-1
to each table for your patrons to scan.


345
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,889 line:0
So once the code's been scanned,
the experience here can include


346
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:38,258 line:0
a simple menu to browse the dishes


347
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,961 line:0
and the ability to continuously
add items to your order.


348
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,530 line:0
Then a checkout experience with Apple Pay.


349
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,835 line:0
Lastly, after you've proven how great
of an experience your App Clip is,


350
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,270 line:0
offer the full app here
so people could order ahead,


351
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,772 line:0
get takeout and delivery.


352
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,441 line:-1
Has it sunk in yet? Great!


353
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:56,910 line:-1
This last example is an AR experience


354
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:58,679 line:-1
where you can use the camera to identify


355
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,881 line:-2
the names of mountains
and peaks around you.


356
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,318 line:-2
So, here the experience could include
a simple camera view...


357
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,720 line:-1
and a way to augment that view


358
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:09,556 line:-2
with annotations and information
about your surroundings.


359
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:15,028 line:-2
And lastly, you might wanna include
a way to share that view with friends.


360
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,065 line:-2
So, those are the essentials
of what goes into an App Clip.


361
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,268 line:-2
At this point, you're probably wondering,
"So, I have an app.


362
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,872 line:-1
How do I turn my app into an App Clip?"


363
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,641 line:-2
Well, the first step
is to focus on a specific task.


364
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,209 line:-1
Let's take this coffee shop app.


365
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:32,412 line:-2
It's got lots of features.
You can order, save your favorite drinks,


366
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,115 line:-2
look up stores near you,
you can even create an account.


367
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:36,683 line:-1
And the way to focus that experience


368
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,586 line:0
is to narrow it down
to just a single feature.


369
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:43,123 line:0
Here we have decided to focus
the experience to only ordering.


370
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:45,325 line:0
The other features,
like saving your favorites


371
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,060 line:0
or looking up other store locations,


372
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,162 line:0
isn't helpful
to the main task of ordering.


373
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,332 line:-2
So, really you wanna simplify
the experience and remove elements


374
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:56,103 line:-2
unrelated to the single task
of being able to order and pay for coffee.


375
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,072 line:-1
This means no unnecessary App Clip intros.


376
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,275 line:-1
Resist the temptation to add instructions,


377
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,478 line:-2
introductions and tutorials
before getting into the main flow.


378
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:07,247 line:-1
Avoid using login or account pages.


379
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:10,017 line:-2
If you need some type of registration,
use Sign in with Apple


380
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,552 line:-1
for speed and privacy.


381
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,488 line:-2
And with your App Clip
being so streamlined,


382
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:17,024 line:-2
you won't need global navigation
or lots of tabs.


383
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:20,794 line:-2
And lastly, avoid any type
of settings or management.


384
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:24,431 line:-2
Okay, so those are the basics
of how you turn your app into an App Clip.


385
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,267 line:-2
Now let's talk about designing UI
for App Clips.


386
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,571 line:-2
More specifically, how to best utilize
system components.


387
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:34,441 line:0
App Clips have the ability
to send notifications.


388
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,678 line:0
It's a great way to relay information
that's essential to the experience.


389
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,647 line:-2
By default, an App Clip
can send notifications


390
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:42,983 line:-2
for up to eight hours
after it's first used.


391
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,919 line:-2
We think this is enough time
to complete most tasks.


392
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,657 line:-2
However, if your App Clip experience
spans more than a day,


393
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:53,861 line:-2
you can request explicit authorization
for an additional week.


394
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:58,031 line:-2
For example, a car rental company
could request explicit authorization


395
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:00,334 line:-1
for a rental that spans multiple days.


396
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:04,171 line:-2
Remember to keep notifications
focused on the task.


397
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:07,140 line:-2
Never send any unexpected
or promotional notifications


398
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,878 line:-2
and only send notifications
in response to an explicit user action.


399
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:14,114 line:-2
If the entire experience takes place
within the App Clip itself,


400
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:16,783 line:-2
you may not even need
to send notifications at all.


401
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:19,887 line:-2
If your App Clip has transactions,
use Apple Pay.


402
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:21,622 line:-1
It's the fastest way to take payments


403
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,691 line:-2
and you don't have to reenter
credit card information or addresses.


404
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:28,228 line:-2
And finally, always promote
the full app at the right time,


405
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:31,331 line:-2
and the right time
is after the primary task is complete.


406
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,668 line:-2
That way your app has had a chance
to prove its value.


407
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,638 line:-2
Remember, App Clips
are not a Trojan horse for your app.


408
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,606 line:-1
They should have value on their own.


409
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,208 line:-1
Okay, so to wrap up,


410
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,644 line:-2
App Clips are native
lightweight experiences


411
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,078 line:-1
available instantly.


412
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:46,513 line:-1
They're in-the-moment experiences


413
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,782 line:-2
that don't stick around
and live on the device.


414
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,153 line:-2
Use App Clip codes
in the real world for discovery.


415
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,721 line:-1
Consider what it means to your app


416
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:57,291 line:-1
to create touch points in physical spaces.


417
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,992 line:-1
And remember to make them highly visible


418
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,961 line:-1
so people can discover them easily.


419
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:07,334 line:-2
Focus your App Clip on a specific task
and remove all unnecessary elements.


420
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:12,105 line:-2
And because of all the different ways
App Clips can be discovered,


421
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:15,375 line:-2
more people can use your app
in clip form than ever before.


422
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:20,414 line:0
Finally, I recommend checking out
the "Human Interface Guidelines,"


423
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,383 line:0
which includes a section
on how to design great App Clips.


424
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,652 line:0
I'd also recommend
all the sessions on App Clips,


425
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:28,288 line:0
including the session
"Configure and Link Your App Clips,"


426
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,324 line:0
for how to set up
getting into your App Clips.


427
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:34,127 line:-2
Thank you so much, and I hope
you go out there and make great App Clips.


428
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:35,963 line:-1
