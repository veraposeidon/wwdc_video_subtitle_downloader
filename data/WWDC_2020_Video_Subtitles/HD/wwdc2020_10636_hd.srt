00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:06,273 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,043 line:0
My name is Suresh Koppisetty,


3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,579 line:0
and I'm an engineer
in Streaming Media Team.


4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,983 line:0
Today I'm going to give you
some updates on


5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,052 line:0
"What's New in Streaming Audio
on Apple Watch."


6
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:24,191 line:-2
Last year in watchOS 6
we introduced the ability


7
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:28,095 line:-2
to stream audio content directly
on Apple Watch.


8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:33,367 line:0
As a developer,
you could use Apple's very own AVPlayer


9
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,870 line:0
or your own custom audio protocols


10
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,840 line:0
for streaming audio content
on Apple Watch.


11
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:44,311 line:-1
This year with watchOS 7,


12
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,981 line:-2
we are bringing the support
for new audio codec in AVPlayer.


13
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:52,619 line:-2
Extended High-Efficiency
Advanced Audio Coding,


14
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,454 line:-1
xHE-AAC,


15
00:00:54,521 --> 00:01:00,127 line:-2
gives us the ability to deliver
equivalent quality at a lower bitrate,


16
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:05,098 line:-2
or you can choose to deliver
higher quality at equivalent bitrate


17
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,202 line:-1
as compared to other codecs in AAC family.


18
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:14,274 line:-2
Now, given that Watch has highly variable
network conditions,


19
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:18,345 line:-2
we should aim to deliver
high-quality audio content


20
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,514 line:-1
with as low bitrate as possible.


21
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:27,688 line:-2
Hence, we recommend using xHE-AAC
for encoding all your audio assets.


22
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,456 line:-1
Having said that,


23
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:36,330 line:-2
for interoperability reasons
we also want you to include AAC-LC, HE-AAC


24
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,701 line:-1
or HE-AACv2 variants in the manifest


25
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:45,405 line:-2
and let the AVPlayer decide
what's the best variant to play.


26
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,609 line:-1
That's all about new codecs on watchOS.


27
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,511 line:-1
In case you want to learn more,


28
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:55,582 line:-2
we have an amazing talk
"Deliver a better HLS Audio Experience"


29
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:56,984 line:-1
by my colleague Simon.


30
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,853 line:-1
Okay, great.


31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,690 line:-2
Now you got streaming audio
on Apple Watch working,


32
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:07,828 line:-2
and you also have this
new highly efficient codec


33
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,830 line:-1
to help you improve user experience,


34
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,233 line:-1
but there is still one thing missing.


35
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,639 line:-1
That's access to protected content.


36
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:23,277 line:-2
Developers have this vast,
evergrowing catalog


37
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:28,682 line:-2
of protected content that they would love
to be able to deliver on Apple Watch.


38
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:34,054 line:-2
To support this, we are happy
to bring FairPlay Streaming to watchOS 7.


39
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:39,893 line:-2
FairPlay Streaming was first introduced
on iOS in 2015.


40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,766 line:-2
It's a specification which describes
the set of steps an app needs to follow


41
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,303 line:-2
in order to securely deliver
content decryption keys


42
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:54,274 line:-2
so the platform could decrypt
and play back encrypted media.


43
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:00,080 line:-2
While delivering FairPlay Streaming keys,
your app works as a liaison


44
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,250 line:-1
between the platform and your key server.


45
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:09,089 line:-2
AVContentKeySession is an
AVFoundation class designed specifically


46
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,091 line:-1
for handling decryption keys.


47
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,996 line:-2
When the application receives
an on-demand key loading request


48
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,464 line:-1
from AVFoundation,


49
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,402 line:-2
It handles the various steps
in key loading process


50
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,974 line:-2
and responds back to AVFoundation
with an encrypted key response.


51
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:33,413 line:-2
With this, AVFoundation can start
decryption and playback.


52
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,251 line:-1
Now, in watchOS 7 we are bringing support


53
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,954 line:-2
for AVContentKeySession
for all your key handling needs.


54
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:46,660 line:-2
AVContentKeySession is not tied
to lifecycle of an Asset.


55
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,931 line:-2
This decouples key loading
from media loading and playback.


56
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:56,170 line:-2
Hence, applications can have
better control on the lifecycle of keys.


57
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:02,476 line:-2
AVContentKeySession allows applications
to initiate key loading on their own


58
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,745 line:-1
at any point in time.


59
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:11,652 line:-2
This gives applications the ability
to optimize key delivery


60
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,189 line:-2
and improve different aspects
of playback experience.


61
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,192 line:-1
To know more about AVContentKeySession,


62
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,597 line:-2
please refer to
"AVContentKeySession Best Practices" talk.


63
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,901 line:-2
That's all about the new things
in watchOS 7.


64
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:33,373 line:-2
Next, I would like to highlight
some of the best practices


65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,510 line:-1
specific to streaming on Apple Watch


66
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:40,047 line:-2
for improving the user experience
even further.


67
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:45,118 line:-2
Streaming on watchOS is not the same
as streaming on iOS.


68
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:51,992 line:-2
Watch is a low-power wearable device,
and due to its increased user mobility,


69
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:55,229 line:-2
the network conditions
on Watch are highly variable.


70
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,466 line:-2
This presents us with some
interesting challenges


71
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,535 line:-1
for building streaming applications.


72
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:07,040 line:-2
With that in mind, we recommend avoiding
unnecessary network round trips,


73
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:12,713 line:-2
including HTTP redirects on any
of the resources needed for playback.


74
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,185 line:-2
Any additional HTTP redirects
would directly contribute to startup time.


75
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,290 line:-2
Pre-fetch resources like keys
and certificates.


76
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,827 line:-2
This will reduce the number
of network requests


77
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,363 line:-1
during critical path of playback start.


78
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,834 line:-2
You could use the newly introduced
AVContentKeySession


79
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,802 line:-1
for prefetching content keys.


80
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,439 line:-2
It also helps
if you cache the certificate.


81
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:46,480 line:-2
You could use the expiry tag from HTTP
responses to decide how long to cache.


82
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,652 line:-2
Since Watch is only dealing
with audio-only content,


83
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:58,926 line:-2
we recommend using a higher
target duration of around 20 seconds


84
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:04,264 line:-2
to be more resilient to network mobility
and battery performance


85
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,336 line:-2
without having a drastic impact
on playback startup time.


86
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,238 line:-1
To summarize,


87
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:17,444 line:-2
we have introduced a new audio codec
that helps you deliver audio content


88
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,679 line:-1
more efficiently.


89
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:24,585 line:-2
We have added the ability
to stream protected content


90
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,920 line:-1
on Watch with FairPlay Streaming.


91
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:32,125 line:-2
We have also talked about
some of the best practices


92
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,795 line:-1
specific to streaming on Apple Watch


93
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,698 line:-1
for improving streaming performance.


94
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:41,935 line:-2
I hope you use
these new additions and tips


95
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,972 line:-1
to build amazing audio apps on Watch


96
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,709 line:-2
and bring novel audio content
to our customers.


97
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,713 line:-2
If you need more information
on best practices


98
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,283 line:-2
for building audio streaming apps
on watchOS,


99
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,553 line:-2
please refer to
these other sessions as well.


100
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,790 line:-1
Thank you and enjoy the rest of WWDC.
