00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:06,874 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:12,880 line:0
Hi. My name is Dale Taylor,
and I'm an engineer on the tvOS team.


3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,149 line:-2
Today I'm going to talk to you
about Search.


4
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,753 line:-1
In tvOS 14, we've made it even better.


5
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,923 line:-1
Here's how Search looks in our TV app.


6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,393 line:-2
We've increased the size of the text
in the search field


7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,395 line:-1
so it's easy to see what you've typed.


8
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:33,333 line:-2
And in many languages, we've optimized
the keyboard layout to one line.


9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,203 line:-2
That leaves more space
for your search results.


10
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,139 line:-1
Some apps, like our music app,


11
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,376 line:-2
take advantage
of our new search suggestions feature.


12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,047 line:-2
These suggestions
allow you to minimize typing


13
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,716 line:-2
and find what you're looking for
even faster.


14
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,554 line:-2
If you're already using
UISearchController,


15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,056 line:-2
you get most of what you've seen here
for free.


16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,395 line:-2
For those of you that aren't, let's review
how simple it is to add to your app.


17
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,763 line:-1
Let me show you.


18
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,566 line:-1
We have a simple tab-based app here


19
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,936 line:-2
with photos and videos
from travel over the years.


20
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,872 line:-1
As a reminder, tvOS apps work best


21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,608 line:-2
with a NavigationController
as the root view controller


22
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,877 line:-1
that contains a UITabBarController.


23
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:20,714 line:-2
Let's head to Xcode
and look at adding SearchUI to our app.


24
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,553 line:-2
First, let's add a new view controller
to go in our tab bar.


25
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,261 line:-1
We can call it "Search View Controller."


26
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,337 line:-2
Then we'll set up
some basic functionality.


27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,009 line:-1
We can configure a tabBarItem.


28
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,445 line:-1
We'll use the search SystemItem


29
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,781 line:-2
because that's the platform convention
for indicating a search tab.


30
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,851 line:-1
Now let's add our search controller.


31
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,720 line:-2
Since we're adding this
as a child view controller,


32
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,856 line:-2
we'll want to put this
in a UISearchContainerViewController.


33
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,226 line:-2
First, let's set up some constants
to hold our variables.


34
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,131 line:0
Then we can create instances
of our SearchController


35
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,033 line:0
and SearchContainerViewController.


36
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,173 line:0
We'll want to add that as a child view
controller as well in viewDidLoad.


37
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,014 line:-2
To show our search results,
we'll need a search results controller.


38
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,817 line:-2
We have one already made
named "GridViewController"


39
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,954 line:-2
with a simple collection view
and an items property.


40
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,158 line:-2
Anything we set on the items property
will show up in our collection view.


41
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,360 line:-1
Let's start by defining a constant.


42
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,964 line:0
[typing]


43
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,576 line:0
Then we can create an instance
of this view controller


44
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,911 line:0
and pass it to our UISearchController.


45
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,013 line:0
[typing]


46
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,192 line:0
We'll also want our search controller
to scroll along with our collection view


47
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,194 line:0
when we scroll through the search results.


48
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,831 line:0
The searchControllerObservedScrollView
in viewDidLoad.


49
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,939 line:-2
We'll want to update the contents
of the results view controller


50
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,774 line:-1
when our search results change.


51
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:31,311 line:-2
Let's start by making our controller
conform to UISearchResultsUpdating.


52
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,650 line:0
[typing]


53
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:42,756 line:0
Then we can set ourselves as the
search results updater in viewDidLoad.


54
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:59,173 line:-2
Then we can handle updates from our search
controller in UpdateSearchResults.


55
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,045 line:0
We can filter out the data,


56
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,182 line:0
and we can set those results
on our search results controller.


57
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,821 line:0
Finally, we can go to our app delegate
and we can add our new view controller


58
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,423 line:0
to our tab bar.


59
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,934 line:-1
Let's give it a try.


60
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,039 line:-2
If I swipe over to search,
you can see what we've built.


61
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,575 line:-1
If we try searching now...


62
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,245 line:-1
we can see it filter our search results.


63
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,684 line:-2
Now let's talk about what we can do
to make it even better.


64
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,354 line:-2
You may remember that I mentioned
search suggestions earlier.


65
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:51,258 line:-2
Before I show you how easy they are
to implement in our sample app,


66
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,727 line:-2
let me tell you a little bit
about how to use them.


67
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,265 line:-2
We've added a new class,
UISearchSuggestionItem.


68
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:02,402 line:-2
It's a model that represents
the search suggestion in the UI.


69
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:09,776 line:-2
It supports an image, text
and a description for accessibility.


70
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,682 line:-2
To display these, you just assign them
to the new search suggestions property


71
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,618 line:-1
on your UISearchController.


72
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,155 line:-2
If you have your own object,
feel free to use that as well,


73
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,093 line:-2
as long as it conforms
to the UISearchSuggestion protocol.


74
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,930 line:0
Here's an example of how you'd use it.


75
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,267 line:0
You can just create
UISearchSuggestionItems


76
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,335 line:0
with the optional properties


77
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:38,505 line:0
and assign an array of suggestions
to the search controller.


78
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,878 line:-2
Now that you know how to add search
suggestions to your search controller,


79
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,514 line:-1
how do you make them update dynamically?


80
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,617 line:-2
You'll use the UISearchResultsUpdating
protocol


81
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,586 line:-1
that I mentioned earlier in the demo.


82
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,558 line:-2
You'll recall this gets assigned
to the searchResultsUpdater property


83
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,293 line:-1
on UISearchController.


84
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:04,698 line:-2
In the demo, we used this protocol
to handle text input updates


85
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,134 line:-2
with UpdateSearchResults
for SearchController.


86
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:12,072 line:-2
We used the search term from
the search bar to query our data source.


87
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:18,545 line:0
We've extended this protocol in tvOS 14
to handle search suggestions.


88
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,482 line:0
When someone using the app
selects a search suggestion,


89
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,817 line:0
you can respond to it in


90
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,855 line:0
updateSearchResults for searchController
selecting searchSuggestion.


91
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,692 line:0
This is useful
because the search suggestion


92
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,062 line:0
can contain more information
than just the search term.


93
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,532 line:0
For instance,
you could use the suggestion's image


94
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,134 line:0
to differentiate between content types.


95
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:46,607 line:-2
Now that I've given you a brief overview
of how search suggestions work,


96
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:50,143 line:-2
let me show you how to add them to our
sample project where we integrated Search.


97
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,214 line:-2
Our data source has the capability
of giving us suggested search results.


98
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:58,552 line:-2
Let's start by making our SuggestedEntry
conform to UISearchSuggestion.


99
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,054 line:-1
[typing]


100
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,460 line:-2
We can define properties
for the localizedSuggestion


101
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,028 line:-1
and iconImage.


102
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,901 line:0
And we'll fill out a description
for accessibility as well.


103
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,408 line:0
You'll notice that for our iconImage,


104
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:24,545 line:0
we're returning a different image,
whether it's a video or a photo,


105
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,014 line:0
that way we can see that
in our suggestion when it's onscreen.


106
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,518 line:-2
Now we can go back
to our search controller


107
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,820 line:-2
and display these suggestions
in our search UI.


108
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,793 line:-2
All we have to do is assign them
to the search suggestions property


109
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,361 line:-1
when the input changes.


110
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:46,233 line:-2
We can fill in our empty parameter
for suggestions.


111
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,737 line:-2
And then we can assign the suggestions
to our searchController.


112
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,174 line:-1
[typing]


113
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,750 line:0
If no one's typed anything,
we don't need any suggestions,


114
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,419 line:0
so we'll assign an empty array.


115
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,322 line:0
[typing]


116
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,096 line:0
Now let's run our app
and see how it looks.


117
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,403 line:-2
If we navigate over to the search tab
and start typing,


118
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,473 line:-2
we can see the suggestions populate
as we type.


119
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,981 line:-2
Let's see what happens
if I click a suggestion.


120
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:40,120 line:-2
Hmm. I clicked on the suggestion
for videos named "Blue,"


121
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,655 line:-2
so I shouldn't have any photos
in my search results.


122
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,593 line:-2
No problem. That's an easy fix.
Let's head back to our search controller.


123
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,399 line:0
We can adopt the new method
in UISearchResultsUpdating


124
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,968 line:0
to handle the search suggestion
being selected.


125
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:03,277 line:0
Then we can check to see if our suggestion
was for a video suggestion.


126
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,118 line:0
If it was, we'll update our search results
accordingly.


127
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:21,195 line:-2
We can navigate back to the search tab,
start typing "blue"


128
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,564 line:-2
and select our suggestion
for "Blue" video.


129
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:28,168 line:-2
You'll notice that now we only see videos
when selecting that suggestion.


130
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,837 line:-1
That's exactly what we wanted.


131
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,440 line:-2
We've worked hard
to make UISearchController


132
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,409 line:-1
as easy to use as possible.


133
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:39,112 line:-2
But here are a few suggestions
to help make sure people using your app


134
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,848 line:-1
have the best experience.


135
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:46,453 line:-2
Our keyboard is highly adaptable
to various languages and input methods.


136
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,523 line:-2
You should consider this
when laying out your search results.


137
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,159 line:-2
Here are a few examples
of alternate layouts.


138
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:57,130 line:-2
For people using IR remotes,
we'll display a grid keyboard.


139
<html>
<head><title>500 Internal Server Error</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>500 Internal Server Error</h1></center>
<hr><center>QTL_Cache/1.2.14</center>
</body>
</html>
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:02,302 line:-2
While typing, the search results
will only occupy some of the screen width,


140
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:05,272 line:-2
and then they'll slide in
to fill the screen when focused.


141
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:12,312 line:-2
When the system language is set to Thai,
we use a three-line keyboard layout


142
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,515 line:-1
to provide the best input experience.


143
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,984 line:-2
Keep this in mind
when sizing search results


144
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,919 line:-1
because not as many will fit onscreen.


145
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,091 line:-2
You should also try to avoid
covering the keyboard with your own UI,


146
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,760 line:-1
even in the borders outside the safe area.


147
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:30,597 line:-2
It'll likely lead to focus issues,
and we don't recommend doing it.


148
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:35,269 line:-2
If you need to differentiate between types
of content in search suggestion items,


149
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,737 line:-1
use a symbol image.


150
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,841 line:-2
It's a great way to present
more information in limited space.


151
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,312 line:-2
Our library of SF Symbols
will work great for these suggestions.


152
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,582 line:-2
Today we've shown you
the improvements we've made


153
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:53,587 line:-2
to UISearchController in tvOS 14
and how easy it is to adopt.


154
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:59,293 line:-2
You saw how you can integrate search
suggestions to make searching even faster.


155
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,963 line:-2
