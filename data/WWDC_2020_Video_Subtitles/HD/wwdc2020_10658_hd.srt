00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,673 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,277 line:0
Hi, my name's Brian


3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,513 line:0
and I'm an engineer
on the Apple Education team.


4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:16,049 line:0
Today I'll be talking about what Apple's
been up to this year in education.


5
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,453 line:-2
For more than 40 years
Apple's been working with educators


6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,289 line:-2
to help them create rich
and meaningful learning experiences.


7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,758 line:-2
More recently,
Apple's provided technologies


8
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27,194 line:-1
to support not just students and teachers,


9
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,296 line:-1
but IT and school administrators as well.


10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,498 line:-2
And, of course,
none of this would be possible


11
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,934 line:-2
without the apps and content
that developers provide.


12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,836 line:-1
Since we launched the App Store,


13
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,839 line:-2
developers like you have built
thousands of amazing educational apps


14
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,542 line:-1
for the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac.


15
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,143 line:-1
We're committed to working with you


16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,579 line:-2
to provide the best
educational experiences for everyone.


17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,949 line:-2
With that in mind,
let's look at how education apps


18
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,384 line:-1
fit into the Apple ecosystem.


19
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,920 line:-2
There's a lot to cover.
So, I'll spend a few minutes


20
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,589 line:-2
on the developer opportunities
in each of these areas.


21
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,525 line:-1
Let's start with Schoolwork.


22
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,161 line:-2
Schoolwork makes it easy for teachers
to share materials,


23
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,530 line:-2
assign activities
and track student progress.


24
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,668 line:-2
The latest version of Schoolwork
introduces a brand-new design.


25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,938 line:-2
It's now even easier to switch
between Handouts and Student views.


26
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,374 line:-1
This is the App Activity Chooser.


27
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,577 line:-2
It's where teachers
can assign the Activities


28
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,012 line:-2
from your ClassKit enabled apps
to a Handout.


29
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:23,417 line:-2
The Chooser now shows
richer metadata for your Activities


30
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,686 line:-2
with the addition of thumbnails
and summary info.


31
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:30,023 line:-2
Be sure to update your app to use
the new metadata fields in ClassKit.


32
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,194 line:-2
The new Handout view
provides insights into overall class


33
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,896 line:-1
and individual student progress.


34
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,533 line:-2
This view is driven by the Progress data
that your app provides.


35
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,703 line:-1
As you can see here, your app can report


36
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,506 line:-2
time spent, percentage complete
and quiz scores.


37
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,642 line:-1
Please see the ClassKit documentation


38
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,878 line:-2
for a complete list
of status reporting options.


39
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,348 line:-1
Schoolwork 2.0 has an all new design,


40
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,584 line:-1
Handout Library and Handout detail view.


41
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,921 line:-2
The Detail view is great for showing
progress from your app's Activities.


42
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,991 line:-2
And there's also support
for the new metadata fields,


43
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,293 line:-2
so you can show off the content
like never before.


44
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,429 line:-2
If you want your app
to work well with Schoolwork,


45
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,465 line:-2
you'll need to adopt
the ClassKit Framework.


46
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,102 line:-2
Once you do, be sure to include
all the metadata that you can


47
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,938 line:-2
and report any progress
on Activities back to ClassKit.


48
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,874 line:-2
Schoolwork helps students
and teachers easily tap into


49
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,976 line:-1
the ecosystem of apps that you create.


50
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,246 line:-2
How do you do that?
You do it with ClassKit.


51
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,315 line:-2
Let's dig into
the latest ClassKit details.


52
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,352 line:-2
As you saw in Schoolwork,
ClassKit is a framework for iOS


53
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,955 line:-2
that lets your app content
be assigned to a student.


54
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,358 line:-2
And your app can then report progress
back to Schoolwork.


55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,395 line:-1
Student data is very sensitive,


56
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,730 line:-2
and that's why ClassKit
only reports Activities


57
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,399 line:-1
that have been assigned in a Handout.


58
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,969 line:-2
And it's only available to certain people,
like the student's teacher.


59
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,839 line:-2
Progress on any Activities
that weren't assigned


60
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,674 line:-1
will not be shared or displayed.


61
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,344 line:-2
For example, if a teacher
gives a student the reading assignment


62
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,213 line:-1
"Fun with Science" in Apple Books,


63
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,683 line:-2
the time spent and reading progress
will be reported for that item.


64
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,520 line:-2
If that student then also reads
"Basic Arithmetic,"


65
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,754 line:-1
no status will be reported


66
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,690 line:-2
because that was not assigned
in a Handout.


67
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:13,460 line:-2
In order for app Activities
to be displayed in the Activity Chooser,


68
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,395 line:-1
your app must first publish that data


69
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,497 line:-1
to ClassKit as a CLSContext.


70
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:21,201 line:-2
Typically, this happens
after a teacher downloads your app


71
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,603 line:-1
and browses to an Activity.


72
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,573 line:-2
This works great for teachers that
are already familiar with your content,


73
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,009 line:-2
and using your app,
but what about those that aren't?


74
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,513 line:-2
That's why today we're introducing
something new for Schoolwork


75
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,248 line:-1
called the ClassKit Catalog API.


76
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,384 line:-1
The ClassKit Catalog is a central store


77
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,219 line:-1
of your app's public Activities.


78
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,588 line:-1
Assigning Activities from your app


79
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,091 line:-2
is no longer limited
to the local context store.


80
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,528 line:-2
Now the only requirement will be
that your app is installed


81
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,597 line:-2
and all of your Activities
will be available from the Catalog.


82
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,433 line:-2
Using a web API,
you can publish your Activities


83
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,836 line:-2
and they will be available
from the Activity Chooser.


84
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,072 line:-2
The Catalog also includes
new metadata fields


85
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,875 line:-2
that'll make it easier for teachers
to find your content.


86
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,611 line:-2
You can learn more
about working with ClassKit


87
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,780 line:-1
and the new ClassKit Catalog API,


88
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,750 line:-2
by checking out this year's session
"What's New in ClassKit."


89
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:14,454 line:-2
To get the most from ClassKit, make sure
to report progress from your Activities.


90
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,890 line:-2
Include the thumbnails
and other improved metadata,


91
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,392 line:-2
and submit your data
to the ClassKit Catalog.


92
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:23,297 line:-2
Schoolwork, ClassKit
and the new ClassKit Catalog API


93
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,799 line:-2
are just the beginning
of what we have for you today.


94
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:29,169 line:-2
Let's take a look at the service that brings
all of our educational apps together.


95
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:32,439 line:-2
Apple School Manager,
our simple, web-based portal


96
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,742 line:-2
for schools to manage accounts,
devices, and content,


97
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,810 line:-1
all from one place.


98
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,246 line:-1
With Apple School Manager,


99
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,515 line:-2
IT administrators
can easily create classes


100
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:44,084 line:-2
and manage login credentials
for teachers and students.


101
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:47,454 line:-2
There are also several options
for streamlining this integration


102
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,724 line:-1
with Student Information Systems, SFTP,


103
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,927 line:-2
and federated authentication
using Microsoft Active Directory.


104
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,631 line:-2
Enrolling devices
into Mobile Device Management is easy


105
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,934 line:-2
and you don't have to physically
touch devices before distributing them.


106
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,304 line:-2
Check out the session
"What's New in Managing Apple Devices"


107
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,273 line:-1
to learn more about Apple School Manager.


108
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,176 line:-2
The Apps and Books section
is where administrators


109
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,011 line:-1
can purchase content for their schools.


110
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,347 line:-1
As a developer, you'll want to make sure


111
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,949 line:-2
it's easy to purchase
and deploy your applications.


112
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,686 line:0
To find out more about
how best to sell your app


113
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,923 line:0
to schools and businesses,
check out the 2019 session


114
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,192 line:0
"App Distribution -
From Ad-hoc to Enterprise."


115
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,397 line:-2
Apple School Manager
is a great way to connect your school


116
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:33,233 line:-2
to both Apple's ecosystem
of products and services


117
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,936 line:-2
as well as the thousands
of educational third-party apps


118
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,205 line:-1
for the iPad, the iPhone and the Mac.


119
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,807 line:-1
And this year, it all works together.


120
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,277 line:-2
Apple School Manager,
Schoolwork, and Classroom


121
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,845 line:-1
are more integrated than ever.


122
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,081 line:-2
Now classes created
in Apple School Manager


123
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,617 line:-2
are automatically available
in both Classroom and Schoolwork.


124
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,354 line:-2
And updates from Apple School Manager
are synced down as well.


125
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,891 line:-2
When students sign in
with their Managed Apple ID,


126
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,860 line:-2
they will automatically
show up in Classroom,


127
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,595 line:-1
and they can see their Schoolwork classes.


128
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,332 line:-2
In addition to better integration
with Apple School Manager,


129
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,868 line:-2
Classroom is getting
a number of new features too.


130
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,571 line:-2
With Classroom, teachers
can easily launch your app


131
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,739 line:-1
on every student's iPad at the same time.


132
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,676 line:-2
Or launch a different app
for each group of students.


133
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,179 line:-2
Teachers can also easily see
what students are up to


134
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,048 line:-1
by viewing their iPad screens


135
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,517 line:-2
and even take a closer look
using pinch to zoom,


136
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,185 line:-1
which is new this spring.


137
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,055 line:-1
And if your app is ClassKit enabled,


138
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,558 line:-2
teachers can even launch your app
with the right Activity already open.


139
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,462 line:-2
If you're a teacher, and you create
your class in Classroom,


140
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,530 line:-1
you start your class


141
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,132 line:-2
and invite your students to join
with a four-digit code.


142
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,668 line:-2
Now you can just tap
the AirPlay Class Code button,


143
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,538 line:-2
and all your class info
is instantly shared


144
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,607 line:-1
with your students on your Apple TV.


145
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,844 line:-2
New this year, classes created
using Apple School Manager


146
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,747 line:-2
and Schoolwork will now show up
instantly in Classroom.


147
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:58,018 line:-2
This fall, teachers will also be able
to create their own classes in Classroom


148
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,287 line:-2
for use in Apple School Manager
and Schoolwork.


149
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,590 line:-2
Classroom added
a bunch of new features this year


150
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,692 line:-2
with Apple School Manager
class integration,


151
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,029 line:-2
AirPlay class invitations
and pinch to zoom.


152
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,366 line:-2
You'll want to make sure
that your app is ClassKit enabled


153
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,368 line:-2
to get the most
from Classroom integration.


154
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,404 line:-2
Now that we've covered
classroom management,


155
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,206 line:-1
how about the student login experience?


156
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,575 line:-1
That brings us to Shared iPad.


157
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,245 line:-2
With Shared iPad, students
can quickly log into an iPad


158
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,181 line:-1
and use it as if it were their own device.


159
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,883 line:-1
Your app should behave on a Shared iPad


160
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,585 line:-1
just like it would on a personal device,


161
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,254 line:-2
except the data
must be synced from the cloud.


162
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,558 line:-1
When a student signs into a Shared iPad,


163
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,661 line:-2
you shouldn't expect that
any of that user's data to be present,


164
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,664 line:-2
as the data may not be available
after the student logs out.


165
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,935 line:-2
And new this fall, Shared iPad
will offer Temporary Session.


166
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:52,272 line:-2
Shared iPad Temporary Session
enables schools to deploy devices


167
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,876 line:-2
with standard configurations that students
can use without sign-in credentials.


168
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,746 line:-2
Imagine that you're a student
on your first day at a new school


169
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,415 line:-1
and your accounts aren't ready yet.


170
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,152 line:-2
With Temporary Session, you can still
grab an iPad and join the class.


171
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,289 line:-2
When you sign out, all the data created
during that session will be deleted.


172
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,526 line:-2
With Temporary Session,
no Apple ID is required to sign in


173
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,796 line:-2
and no data is retained
after the end of the session.


174
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,632 line:-2
By default, Temporary Session
is turned on.


175
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,667 line:-1
If you're an MDM developer,


176
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,703 line:-2
we've introduced
a new supervised restriction


177
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,939 line:-2
for customers to choose to opt out
of using Temporary Sessions.


178
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,277 line:-2
Remember, for your app to provide
a good student experience,


179
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,145 line:-1
all data must be synced from the cloud.


180
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,482 line:-2
And when a student is done
with the Shared iPad and logs out,


181
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,086 line:-2
your app needs to be ready
to sync in the background.


182
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,121 line:-1
Using longLived CKOperations


183
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,457 line:-2
and UIBackgroundTasks
will make this possible.


184
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,295 line:-2
That brings us to the topic
that all students love, taking tests.


185
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,663 line:-1
New in macOS this year


186
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,232 line:-2
is the Automatic Assessment
Configuration Framework.


187
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,135 line:-2
We introduced the ability
for iPads to be used


188
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,204 line:-1
in standardized testing in 2016.


189
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,073 line:-2
And we wanted to bring
this feature to the Mac as well.


190
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,477 line:-2
The new Automatic Assessment
Configuration Framework


191
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,446 line:-2
enables educational institutions
to leverage the power of the Mac,


192
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,482 line:-1
while at the same time preventing students


193
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,218 line:-2
from using features that could give them
an unfair advantage.


194
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:14,254 line:-2
The Automatic Assessment
Configuration Framework


195
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,223 line:-1
allows you to provide a secure environment


196
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,525 line:-2
for your applications
to deliver tests to students.


197
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:23,697 line:-2
The Framework is available on iOS,
macOS and supports Catalyst as well.


198
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,267 line:-2
Test takers are locked
into the testing app


199
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:30,804 line:-2
and features, such as Screen Sharing,
Universal Clipboard or Dictation


200
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,440 line:-2
are automatically disabled
for the duration of the test.


201
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,609 line:-1
To find out how your app


202
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,911 line:-2
can take advantage
of the new Assessment Framework,


203
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:40,781 line:-2
see this year's session,
"What's New in Assessment."


204
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,252 line:-2
If you're developing a testing app
on iOS or the Mac,


205
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,688 line:-2
you should consider adopting
the Assessment Framework.


206
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,891 line:-2
You'll need to apply for a new entitlement,
so check out


207
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,261 line:-2
the Automatic Assessment Configuration
documentation for more information.


208
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:59,032 line:-2
On iOS, the old UIKit Assessment mode
has been deprecated,


209
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,235 line:-2
so please be sure to switch
to the new framework.


210
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,905 line:-2
Also on iOS, you can use
configuration options to customize


211
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,207 line:-2
which system features
are available during testing.


212
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,111 line:-2
And that's what's new
in Apple Education this year.


213
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,014 line:-2
Now that you've heard
of all of our updates,


214
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,782 line:-1
it's time to figure out where you fit in.


215
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,085 line:-2
If you create apps
for use in the classroom,


216
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,486 line:-1
you should be using ClassKit.


217
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,422 line:-2
You'll want your app's content
to be easily available


218
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,157 line:-1
for teachers to assign as Activities.


219
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,761 line:-2
So be sure to submit all of your
app Activities to the ClassKit Catalog.


220
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,364 line:-1
If you create apps for testing,


221
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,633 line:-2
be sure to check out
this year's Assessment session


222
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,169 line:-2
on how to deploy your app
on iOS and the Mac.


223
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:39,439 line:-2
And all education apps should be ready
to work well on a Shared iPad.


224
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,911 line:-2
Whether you make an MDM system
to help IT manage thousands of devices


225
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,680 line:-2
or an app that helps
third graders study vocabulary,


226
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,383 line:-2
every piece of technology
built by developers like you


227
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,519 line:-2
creates a better learning environment
for future generations.
