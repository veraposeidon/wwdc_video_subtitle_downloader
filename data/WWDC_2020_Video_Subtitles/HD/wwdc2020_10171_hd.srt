00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:07,474 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:14,314 line:0
Hi and welcome to this session
on "What's New in WatchOS Design."


3
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:18,585 line:0
I'm Jennifer Patton, and I'm
a Watch designer on the Apple Design Team.


4
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,956 line:-2
In this session, I'm going to talk about
some of the ways


5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,627 line:-2
that we added new functionality
to native apps on the Watch this year,


6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,231 line:-2
and how you can bring some of this
same functionality to your watchOS apps.


7
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:33,267 line:-1
I'm super excited to share with you


8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,602 line:-2
some of the things
we learned along the way,


9
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,137 line:-1
so let's get started.


10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,574 line:-1
We'll start with a few guiding principles.


11
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,543 line:-1
When designing your Watch app,


12
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:47,214 line:-2
keep in mind that
Watch apps should be lightweight.


13
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,317 line:-2
Like in this example
from the Sleep Cycle app,


14
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:55,055 line:-2
limit lengthy interactions and be choosy
when it comes to functionality.


15
00:00:55,522 --> 00:01:00,460 line:-2
Ideally you can get all the information
from your Watch app at a glance.


16
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:05,432 line:-2
When adding functionality to your app,
keep it actionable.


17
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:09,703 line:-2
Wikiloc offers a filter option
in their list view.


18
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:14,474 line:-2
Filtering is a great way to make
user interactions relevant to you


19
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,844 line:-2
in the moment
you're interacting with your app.


20
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:21,481 line:-2
And finally, once you've decided
that an action is critical


21
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:26,119 line:-2
to the experience of your Watch app,
make it discoverable.


22
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,089 line:-2
Here's a great example
from the Watch app, Bear,


23
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,793 line:-2
that shows a clear visual button
to interact with.


24
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,597 line:-2
This year on watchOS,
we did a complete audit


25
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,633 line:-1
of all the gesture-based contextual menus


26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,804 line:-2
across the entire operating system
and native apps.


27
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,340 line:-1
In previous watchOS versions,


28
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,676 line:-2
actions were placed
in a gesture-based contextual menu.


29
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,816 line:-2
In watchOS 7, we have moved
all of these actions into the apps


30
00:01:55,883 --> 00:02:00,053 line:-2
in an effort to make the experience
more intuitive for every user.


31
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:05,993 line:-2
In the process, we've created
some great new interactions on Watch


32
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,127 line:-1
that didn't exist before,


33
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:11,698 line:-2
and we're excited to see
how you'll develop these new patterns


34
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,301 line:-1
in your watchOS apps.


35
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:18,572 line:-2
During the design process,
we had these three goals in mind.


36
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,611 line:-2
First, interactions should be
both discoverable and predictable.


37
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:30,384 line:-2
Secondly, relevant actions
should always be visible in the app.


38
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:36,256 line:-2
And thirdly,
eliminate gesture-based contextual menus


39
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,692 line:-1
without removing functionality.


40
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,529 line:-2
As we brought these sensibilities
into our designs,


41
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:46,400 line:-2
we learned that many of the actions
we wanted to display


42
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:50,938 line:-2
really fall into the category
of secondary actions.


43
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,807 line:-2
The interactions
I want to talk about today


44
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,910 line:-2
are not the primary reason
you're using a Watch app.


45
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:01,215 line:-2
Instead,
they add or increase functionality,


46
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,252 line:-2
provide a secondary,
but still important action,


47
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,788 line:-1
or provide a way to filter, sort,


48
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,792 line:-2
or otherwise interact with
the primary actions already in the view.


49
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,329 line:-2
Once you've narrowed down
the actions in your app


50
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,833 line:-2
to just what is essential
for a delightful Watch experience,


51
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,537 line:-2
here are some ways
to show secondary actions in your app.


52
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:30,077 line:-2
We'll talk about commonly-used actions
like sort and filter menus


53
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,714 line:-2
that can help make long lists
easier to navigate.


54
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,050 line:-1
We'll talk about swipe actions


55
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:42,055 line:-2
that can make a few key secondary actions
easily accessible.


56
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,927 line:-2
We'll talk about
where to put more options,


57
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:51,899 line:-2
the value of adding actions
to the bottom of a scrolling view


58
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:57,538 line:-2
and a new toolbar button for suggesting
essential actions in a long list.


59
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:03,977 line:-2
We'll also talk about when to use
a hierarchical navigation model


60
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,880 line:-1
for changing destinations within an app.


61
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,184 line:-1
Let's start with sort and filter.


62
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,689 line:-2
A long scrolling list can become
much easier to use, and more personal,


63
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,158 line:-1
if you have the ability to sort and filter


64
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:21,528 line:-2
to just the information
relevant to you in the moment.


65
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,865 line:-1
In watchOS 7, we added this button


66
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:28,669 line:-2
to the top of the Activity Sharing list
in the Activity app.


67
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,406 line:-2
I share my activity
with a long list of friends and family,


68
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:36,877 line:-2
and maybe I'd like to see
who's done the most exercise today.


69
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,913 line:-2
I simply tap on that sort button
at the top...


70
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,916 line:-1
and I get a modal view,


71
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:47,554 line:-2
with a linked table view that allows me
to sort my list with a single tap,


72
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,890 line:-1
selecting Exercise instead.


73
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,359 line:-1
Dang, Molly. It's not even 11:00 a.m.!


74
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:57,564 line:-2
Here's one more example,
and we call this a view switcher,


75
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,434 line:-2
slightly different
from filtering content out.


76
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,936 line:-2
We're just viewing a different set of data
in this one.


77
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,508 line:-2
In my Stocks app,
I can view all the stocks I'm following


78
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,177 line:-1
at a glance in the list view.


79
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:14,381 line:-2
But what if this information
just isn't quite relevant to me right now?


80
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,850 line:-2
Let's tap on the button
at the top of the list


81
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,886 line:-1
and choose Points instead.


82
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,521 line:-1
There, that's better.


83
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,857 line:-2
Now I'm viewing points
instead of percentages in the list,


84
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,793 line:-2
which is just the information
I was looking for.


85
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:31,665 line:-2
Sort and filter menus
are a lightweight and actionable way


86
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,934 line:-1
to narrow down any long list


87
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:38,739 line:-2
and make it easier to navigate
and more relevant to you in the moment.


88
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,710 line:-2
To create a menu for sorting, filtering,
or view switching,


89
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:47,781 line:-1
simply nest a picker in a list in SwiftUI.


90
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:52,920 line:-2
Another API you can use in a list
is a swipe action.


91
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,689 line:-1
We use these actions all the time in iOS,


92
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,926 line:-2
and we're starting to use them
more and more in watchOS


93
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,261 line:-1
for displaying actions in a list view.


94
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:06,967 line:-2
World Clock has a perfect example
of a secondary action in a list view.


95
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:12,206 line:-2
In my list of cities,
I can swipe a table row from right to left


96
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:15,809 line:-1
to reveal a clear and recognizable prompt


97
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,112 line:-2
to remove this city
from the list immediately.


98
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,449 line:-1
I can always re-add it again easily


99
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,519 line:-2
with the "Add City" button
at the bottom of the list.


100
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:31,258 line:-2
The swipe action API is called
the onDelete modifier


101
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:34,094 line:-1
and is currently available in SwiftUI.


102
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,900 line:-2
We've talked
about adding functionality to a list.


103
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,737 line:-2
But what if your Watch app
has more options


104
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:47,708 line:-2
that you need to surface
in a glanceable view that doesn't scroll?


105
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:53,313 line:-2
In this Maps example,
the entire screen is an active area.


106
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,217 line:-2
I can move the map with my finger
to pan around


107
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:02,322 line:-2
or tap the current location button
to snap back to my current location.


108
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,627 line:-2
But we also have
a couple of additional actions


109
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:10,197 line:-2
that we need to show
in this non-scrolling glanceable view.


110
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,368 line:-2
So, we've added another button
in the bottom right


111
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,604 line:-2
with the ellipsis glyph
in the app's key color


112
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,007 line:-1
that can present these actions.


113
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,309 line:-1
This is known as a More button.


114
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:28,682 line:-2
By tapping this More button,
I can now search this area of the map,


115
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:32,019 line:-2
or toggle between transit
and standard views.


116
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,688 line:-1
The options in this contextual menu


117
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:38,659 line:-2
add functionality
to the viewable area of the map.


118
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,596 line:-2
It's pertinent to what I'm doing
in this moment,


119
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,365 line:-1
and it's discoverable and reliable.


120
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,504 line:-2
Inside the modal, you can show
a simple set of actions like this one,


121
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,574 line:-1
or a more complex list of actions,


122
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,410 line:-1
like the one in the Camera app.


123
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,413 line:-1
If I open my Camera app on my Watch,


124
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,685 line:-2
I can use my Watch as a remote
to take a picture with my iPhone camera.


125
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:10,324 line:-2
Incidentally, we switched to
the three-second shutter as the default,


126
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,861 line:-2
so I don't get caught in the picture
looking down at my Watch,


127
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,296 line:-1
which I think is a great improvement.


128
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,738 line:-2
And now, let's say
I have my iPhone all set up


129
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:28,275 line:-2
and ready to shoot
another awesome full-length selfie


130
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,612 line:-2
and I decide I want to change
my flash settings,


131
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,047 line:-1
toggle Live Photo on or off,


132
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,618 line:-2
or take some other common actions
right from my Watch.


133
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:42,155 line:-2
Tapping on the More button
on the bottom right of the screen


134
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:46,493 line:-2
gives me a modal table view
full of options for my camera settings.


135
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:52,900 line:-2
This is an example of a sheet API
with a pretty robust list of options.


136
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:58,405 line:-2
Let's focus on the design
of the More button for a minute.


137
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:05,445 line:-2
You can create your own More button
using a simple circular container element


138
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:09,049 line:-2
with the SF symbol "ellipsis"
centered inside.


139
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,153 line:-2
Refer to Apple's
Human Interface Guidelines


140
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,790 line:-2
for the recommended hit regions
for each Watch screen size,


141
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:22,162 line:-2
and add transparent padding
around your button if needed


142
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,065 line:-2
to ensure that your button
is comfortably tappable.


143
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:30,971 line:-2
Now the Camera app has quite
a few options beneath the More button,


144
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:36,210 line:-2
but what if you have a single secondary
action that you need to provide,


145
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,779 line:-1
like this example in the Photos app?


146
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:44,117 line:-2
In watchOS 7,
we added a button to the lower left


147
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:48,322 line:-2
so that I can create a Watch Face
directly from the Photos app on my Watch.


148
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,793 line:-2
Since there's really
only a single action here,


149
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,731 line:-2
instead of the ellipsis symbol,
we designed an Apple Watch Face glyph.


150
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:03,871 line:-2
You can design a glyph that families well
with the glyph language for your own app,


151
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:08,475 line:-2
or utilize the glyphs available to you
in SF Symbols.


152
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:14,982 line:-2
This More button needs to work on
a very dark and a very light background.


153
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:19,353 line:-2
In order to make this button legible
on any background,


154
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:24,224 line:-2
we used a white circular container
at 85% opacity


155
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,495 line:-2
with a 1 point black outer glow
at 50% opacity.


156
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:34,768 line:-2
The More button is a perfect way
to get to a menu of secondary actions


157
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,938 line:-2
that are pertinent to the content
you're currently viewing.


158
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:43,377 line:-2
It's especially important to separate
primary from secondary actions


159
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,180 line:-1
when you think about using a More button.


160
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:49,883 line:-2
Never put primary actions
inside a More menu


161
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,752 line:-1
and be sure to be very choosy


162
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,721 line:-2
about which secondary actions
you offer there, too.


163
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:59,193 line:-2
Use a More button
in a glanceable full-screen view


164
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:03,497 line:-2
or in a carousel list,
like this example in the Workout app


165
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,834 line:-2
when you need to provide
contextual options,


166
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,502 line:-1
but you don't have a lot of space.


167
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,106 line:-2
Action buttons
at the bottom of a detail view


168
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,476 line:-2
may be the most discoverable
and intuitive way


169
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,645 line:-1
to show actions in your app.


170
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:22,182 line:-1
Here's an example from the Calendar app.


171
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,719 line:-2
In this calendar event
that I've been invited to,


172
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,989 line:-2
we've added a button
to the bottom of the event detail


173
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:32,559 line:-2
that allows me to e-mail
the sender of the invitation.


174
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,062 line:-1
The actions in the bottom of a detail view


175
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,098 line:-2
should always apply to the content
of the view above it.


176
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,134 line:-1
Here's another calendar event.


177
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,104 line:-2
This is a calendar event
that I've created.


178
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:48,275 line:-2
At the bottom of any self-created
calendar event detail,


179
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:49,543 line:-1
we've added a button


180
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,147 line:-2
so that I can delete this event
from my calendar easily from my wrist.


181
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,917 line:-1
To avoid confusion,


182
00:11:56,984 --> 00:12:00,888 line:-2
the information in this event detail
that's not actionable


183
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,123 line:-1
sits directly on the black background.


184
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:09,696 line:-2
Only the action button at the bottom
sits in a container and looks tappable.


185
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:15,302 line:-2
Use a red text label on the button
to indicate a destructive action.


186
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:19,506 line:-2
And add a confirmation alert
if the information being deleted


187
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,042 line:-1
is not easily retrievable.


188
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:26,947 line:-2
Next, I want to introduce a brand-new API
called the toolbar button.


189
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:32,753 line:-2
We designed this button to solve
a specific interaction need on Watch,


190
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,489 line:-2
the Compose buttons
in Messages and in Mail.


191
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,059 line:-1
Wait, where is it?


192
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,931 line:-2
It's tucked beneath the navigation bar
for the moment when I need it.


193
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:49,937 line:-2
I likely did not open Messages on my Watch
to compose a new message.


194
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,140 line:-2
Instead, my primary reason
for navigating here


195
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:57,077 line:-2
is likely to read a new message
that just came in.


196
00:12:57,144 --> 00:13:00,781 line:-2
But if I did open my app
to start a new messages thread,


197
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:03,650 line:-2
the compose button is there
waiting for me,


198
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:07,754 line:-2
and I can tuck it back away
when I'm not using it.


199
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,758 line:-2
You can find this toolbar button API
in SwiftUI.


200
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:15,095 line:-1
Only use it in a scrolling view.


201
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:18,298 line:-2
Scrolling is what makes
this button discoverable.


202
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,301 line:-1
And use it judiciously,


203
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:25,472 line:-2
only for actions that are essential
to the functioning of your app,


204
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,575 line:-2
but may not be
the primary action for the view.


205
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,313 line:-2
So far, we've been talking
about simple ways


206
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,483 line:-2
you can add functionality
to your Watch app


207
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,485 line:-1
with various types of buttons.


208
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:43,590 line:-2
In watchOS 7, we had another case
that we needed to solve


209
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,093 line:-1
where a button just couldn't do the trick.


210
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,795 line:-1
It needed a different navigational model:


211
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,699 line:-1
hierarchical navigation.


212
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:57,538 line:-2
In some cases, it makes sense to land
one level in when you open a Watch app.


213
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:01,175 line:-1
An example is what we do here in Mail.


214
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:05,879 line:-2
When I open my Mail app,
I'm already in my All Inboxes view,


215
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,682 line:-1
ready to read my most recent e-mail.


216
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:13,287 line:-2
But if I tap the back button
in the navigation bar,


217
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:17,357 line:-2
I'm at the top level of the app,
and I can change my destination


218
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:22,596 line:-2
to visit my Apple e-mail inbox
or my personal e-mail inbox.


219
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,798 line:-1
Let's check my Apple e-mail.


220
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,567 line:-1
The title in the navigation bar


221
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,636 line:-2
lets me know
which inbox I'm currently reading,


222
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:34,708 line:-2
and the back button is still right there,
so I can jump back and switch anytime.


223
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:37,511 line:-1
In a hierarchical navigation model,


224
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:40,814 line:-2
the app should remember
the destination I chose


225
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,283 line:-1
the next time I open the app.


226
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,054 line:-2
If your interaction doesn't call
for that level of permanence,


227
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,990 line:-2
then this is probably
not the right model to use.


228
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:55,329 line:-2
Another example that we added
to watchOS this year is in the Home app.


229
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,632 line:-1
Now when I open my Home app on my Watch,


230
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:02,569 line:-2
I land here in my device list
for my house.


231
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:04,771 line:-1
But tapping back in the top left


232
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:08,509 line:-2
takes me to a top level list
of destinations.


233
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:13,013 line:-2
From here, I can simply switch
to my design studio,


234
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,850 line:-2
and now I can see and interact
with the devices that I have there.


235
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:20,387 line:-2
The title in the navigation bar
has changed


236
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:23,123 line:-2
to indicate the destination
that I am currently in,


237
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:27,561 line:-2
and tapping back will always
reliably take me right back


238
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:30,764 line:-1
to that same list of destinations.


239
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:35,369 line:-2
I truly hope this session
on "What's New in WatchOS Design"


240
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,939 line:-2
helps you bring useful functionality
to your Watch apps.


241
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:44,378 line:-2
When designing or updating your Watch app
for watchOS 7, remember,


242
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:48,815 line:-2
with so many different ways
to improve navigation in your app,


243
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:53,820 line:-2
be extra particular about
what you put inside contextual menus.


244
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:59,326 line:-2
Choose actions that are essential
to a delightful Watch experience.


245
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:03,063 line:-2
And, once you've decided
on which actions to offer,


246
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,832 line:-1
steer clear of gesture-based menus


247
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:11,605 line:-2
and instead, offer a clear visual button
or predictable interaction pattern.


248
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:15,209 line:-2
By keeping these simple design goals
in mind,


249
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,911 line:-2
you'll make your app relevant
and easy to navigate


250
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,247 line:-1
for everyone who wants to use it.


251
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:23,250 line:0
For additional information,
be sure to check out


252
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:27,354 line:0

in the Apple Developer app.


253
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,122 line:-1
Thank you.
