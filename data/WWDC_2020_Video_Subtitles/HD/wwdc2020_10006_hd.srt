1
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:06,874 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,177 line:0
Hello, I'm Matthias Lerch,


3
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:14,781 line:0
and today I'm so excited to talk about
the digital version of car keys


4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,050 line:0
now available in iOS.


5
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:21,922 line:-2
With car keys, people can unlock, lock,
and start their car


6
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,157 line:-1
using iPhone and Apple Watch.


7
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:29,263 line:-2
Keys are stored securely
on their personal Apple device,


8
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,832 line:-1
and you can delete them via iCloud.


9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:37,838 line:-2
And because they're digital,
it's easy to share keys with friends


10
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,506 line:-1
or manage them remotely.


11
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:43,744 line:-2
It can work
with different radio technologies.


12
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,681 line:-1
This week we introduce support for NFC.


13
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:52,419 line:-2
In the future, Ultra Wideband technology
will provide even more convenience.


14
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:58,091 line:-2
The car key system is designed to work
without a network connection.


15
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:04,598 line:-2
And after a long day of hiking, people can
still get into their car and drive home


16
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,201 line:-2
because the feature works
with power reserve.


17
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:14,041 line:-2
This session is geared towards automakers
interested in supporting digital car keys.


18
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:18,579 line:-2
To work with this system,
your car needs to support owner pairing,


19
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,315 line:-1
transactions and server interfaces.


20
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,084 line:-1
Owner pairing is the first step


21
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,754 line:-2
and is required to set up
a digital car key on iPhone.


22
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,893 line:0
Owner pairing establishes a privileged
and secure association


23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,395 line:0
between the owner's iPhone and the car


24
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,966 line:0
using a short-range radio channel
such as NFC.


25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,836 line:-2
First, the user must prove
that they own the car.


26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,840 line:-2
The requirements here are defined by you,
the automaker.


27
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,877 line:-1
Next, they initiate pairing.


28
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:54,314 line:-2
The easiest way is to use an automaker app
that you provide.


29
00:01:54,982 --> 00:02:00,521 line:-2
For new cars, you can also send a welcome
e-mail containing a link to start pairing.


30
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,825 line:-2
When the car is ready,
the user places iPhone


31
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,494 line:-2
onto the car's NFC reader
in the dashboard.


32
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,198 line:-2
As a fallback, you should also
provide an option


33
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,700 line:-2
to start owner pairing
from within the car.


34
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:18,071 line:-2
In this case, placing iPhone
onto the car's NFC reader


35
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,041 line:-2
allows them to manually enter
a pairing pass code.


36
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,179 line:-2
The pairing process
runs for a few seconds,


37
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,382 line:-2
then the car key appears in Wallet,
ready to use.


38
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,385 line:-1
Next, transactions.


39
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,987 line:-2
Transactions are the heart
of the car key system.


40
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:38,258 line:-2
Transactions are used
to unlock or lock the car


41
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,993 line:-1
and to authorize engine start.


42
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,531 line:-2
Cars must provide at least one
NFC reader in the door handle


43
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:45,999 line:-1
and one in the dashboard.


44
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:51,905 line:-2
Simply place iPhone near the door handle
to unlock or lock the door.


45
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:52,973 line:-1
[chimes]


46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,910 line:-2
Of course, the pass will be customized
to match your car brand


47
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,245 line:-1
and will look great.


48
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,283 line:-2
And in the car, place the device
on the tray reader in the dashboard


49
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,885 line:-1
to authorize engine start.


50
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:05,953 line:-1
[chimes]


51
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:10,791 line:-2
Transactions are optimized
for security and performance


52
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,293 line:-1
to ensure a smooth user experience.


53
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:19,366 line:-2
Express Mode lets the feature work
without Face ID or a pass code.


54
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,869 line:-1
It's turned on by default,


55
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,539 line:-2
but users who want additional security
can turn it off.


56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,278 line:-2
In this case, user authentication
is required for each relevant transaction.


57
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,382 line:-1
All transactions work fully off-line.


58
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,051 line:-2
You don't need a network connection
to drive your car.


59
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:43,390 line:-2
And because transaction information
is not sent,


60
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,959 line:-1
Apple doesn't know when you use your car.


61
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,764 line:-2
Some feature, such as key sharing
and key management


62
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,633 line:-1
do require a server connection.


63
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,737 line:-1
Key sharing works with Messages on iPhone.


64
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,108 line:-2
The car doesn't need to be online
when sharing,


65
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,377 line:-1
and private information is encrypted.


66
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,947 line:-2
So when the owner shares a key
with family members or friends,


67
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,682 line:-1
Apple doesn't know any of it.


68
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,087 line:-2
As the automaker, you can provide
different access levels for shared keys.


69
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:18,926 line:-2
In this example, the car supports
two access levels for each key.


70
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,262 line:-1
"Unlock and Drive" is unrestricted.


71
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:28,368 line:-2
"Access and Drive Restricted"
limits the car speed to 65 miles per hour.


72
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:33,640 line:-2
Again, it's up to each automaker
to define access levels.


73
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:37,277 line:0
Users can mange all keys on iPhone.


74
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:41,748 line:-2
Owners can remove their own key
or revoke shared keys,


75
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,351 line:-2
and the car
can provide similar functionality too.


76
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,288 line:-2
Keys removed from a device
stop working immediately,


77
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,057 line:-1
even if the device is off-line.


78
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,594 line:-2
Family and friends
can only manage their own keys.


79
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:59,733 line:-2
iCloud lost mode and remote card deletion
are fully supported.


80
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,669 line:-1
And device upgrades are simple.


81
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,005 line:-1
When the owner buys a new iPhone,


82
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:09,042 line:-2
all they have to do
is to pair their new device with the car.


83
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,179 line:-1
The key on their old iPhone is removed,


84
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,882 line:-1
shared keys continue to work,


85
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:19,119 line:-2
and everything is automatically
transferred to the new iPhone.


86
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,523 line:-1
Now that we've introduced the feature,


87
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,193 line:-2
let's look under the hood
and examine the system architecture,


88
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,594 line:-1
radio technologies,


89
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,664 line:-1
server integration and automaker apps.


90
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,868 line:-2
Let's start by looking
at the system architecture.


91
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,740 line:-2
The core features, pairing,
sharing and revocation


92
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,209 line:-1
are supported natively on iOS.


93
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:46,947 line:-2
Automaker apps are not required, even when
you share your keys with friends.


94
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,985 line:-2
Cryptographic keys are generated
in the Secure Element on the device


95
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,587 line:-1
and are never exported.


96
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:59,459 line:-2
All features use standard AES
and elliptic-curve algorithms


97
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,330 line:-2
for higher security and easy adoption
on any platform.


98
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,102 line:-2
The system is based on Public Key
Infrastructure for off-line use.


99
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,042 line:-2
And for simple server integration,
a Trusted Service Manager is not required.


100
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,546 line:0
Let's take a closer look
at this new digital car key.


101
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:24,451 line:-2
Our goal was to bind keys
to the user's device,


102
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,520 line:-1
and not to Apple or the automaker.


103
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,022 line:-1
Therefore, an elliptic-curve key pair


104
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,558 line:-2
is created in the Secure Element
on the iPhone.


105
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,863 line:-2
The private key always stays
in the Secure Element.


106
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:42,436 line:-2
The public key is exported in an X.509
certificate for authenticity verification.


107
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,840 line:-2
An applet in the Secure Element
implements the car key.


108
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:51,211 line:-2
The applet stores the key pair
and binds it to the car.


109
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,547 line:-1
It implements transactions


110
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:58,719 line:-2
and manages secure mailboxes which store
key attestations and security tokens


111
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,289 line:-2
the prevent a revoked car key
from being reactivated.


112
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,792 line:-1
Mailboxes also support immobilizer tokens


113
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:09,229 line:-2
for compatibility
with existing car architectures.


114
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:15,068 line:-2
For memory efficiency, all car keys
are hosted in a single applet instance.


115
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:19,306 line:-2
A typical car key system
has some standard components.


116
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,276 line:-1
Of course, we have iPhone and the car.


117
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,746 line:-1
They communicate directly via NFC.


118
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,650 line:-2
iPhone and the car
each have associated back-end systems.


119
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,886 line:-1
The back-end systems are connected,


120
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:37,291 line:-2
and there are times when the automaker app
needs to communicate with its server.


121
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:42,596 line:-2
Let's use owner pairing as an example and
see how these components work together.


122
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,700 line:-1
The automaker server generates a verifier


123
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,603 line:-2
which is provisioned into the car
at production


124
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,271 line:-1
or over a telematics link.


125
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,876 line:-2
A matching pairing password
is made available to the owner


126
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,444 line:-1
via an automaker app.


127
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,481 line:-2
With the pairing password
and the verifier,


128
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,852 line:-2
we can create a secure channel
for the pairing transaction.


129
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:10,490 line:-2
We have chosen an elliptic-curve based
PAKE protocol with augmented security


130
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,026 line:-1
and low memory requirements on car side.


131
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:17,998 line:-2
At first, the vehicle sends
its identity certificates to the device.


132
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:23,270 line:-2
The owner iPhone creates the owner key
in the car key applet


133
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,039 line:-1
after successful certificate verification.


134
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:30,110 line:-2
It then returns the identity certificates
of the new key


135
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,912 line:-1
back to the car for acceptance.


136
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:36,149 line:-2
From now on, car and device
are cryptographically linked together.


137
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,419 line:-1
To register the key,


138
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:43,256 line:-2
the owner iPhone sends encrypted data
to the automaker server


139
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,325 line:-1
and receives a confirmation attestation.


140
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,129 line:-2
Then the Apple server activates the key
in the device


141
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,131 line:-1
and loads the pass into Wallet.


142
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,434 line:-1
To enable the key on car side,


143
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:58,605 line:-2
the device provides the confirmation
attestation to the car over NFC


144
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,074 line:-1
during the owner pairing transactions.


145
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,811 line:-2
If the device was off-line
during the owner pairing,


146
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:09,850 line:-2
the attestation can also be provided later
during the first usage of the key.


147
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:15,689 line:-2
Once iPhone is paired with the car,
transactions occur fully off-line.


148
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,026 line:-2
No information
needs to be provided to the servers.


149
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,764 line:0
Next, I'd like to walk you
through key sharing.


150
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:29,937 line:0
With key sharing, there are two devices:
the owner iPhone and friend iPhone.


151
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,374 line:-2
The owner starts by sending an invitation
using Messages.


152
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,312 line:-2
The invitation
specifies the key configuration,


153
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,181 line:-1
such as the access level and car identity.


154
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:46,253 line:-2
The friend iPhone creates a new car key
based on the invitation.


155
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,657 line:-2
Then it sends
the new key's identity certificate chain


156
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:54,628 line:-2
back to the owner
via the Apple Identity Service, IDS.


157
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,930 line:-1
This is not visible to the user.


158
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,767 line:-2
The owner device
verifies the certificate--


159
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,070 line:-1
We'll see in a minute how that works--


160
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:06,006 line:-2
and issues
a signed confirmation attestation.


161
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,242 line:-1
Similar to owner pairing,


162
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:12,212 line:-2
the confirmation attestation
allows the car to accept the friend key.


163
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:18,185 line:-2
The owner iPhone sends the attestation
back to the friend via IDS.


164
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,054 line:-1
This is also not visible to the user.


165
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,258 line:-1
If the car is off-line,


166
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,327 line:-2
the friends presents
the registered confirmation attestation


167
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:31,231 line:-2
during their first transaction
using their phone with the car.


168
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,034 line:-1
They can now unlock and drive the car.


169
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,005 line:-1
Note that if the car is online,


170
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:42,342 line:-2
the attestation can also be transmitted
to the car during key registration.


171
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:48,782 line:-2
Before we dive into the cryptography
of pairing, sharing and transactions,


172
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,718 line:-2
let's review the complete life cycle
of a car key.


173
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:57,157 line:-2
A car key is created through owner pairing
or key sharing.


174
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:02,429 line:-2
Transactions lock and unlock the car,
authorize engine start,


175
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,132 line:-1
and exchange encrypted data with the car.


176
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:12,206 line:-2
iCloud Lost Mode temporarily suspends
car keys on iPhone or Apple Watch


177
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,542 line:-2
by locking the car key applet
on the Secure Element.


178
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:22,349 line:-2
The owner can revoke shared car keys
from their device or from the car UI.


179
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:28,488 line:-2
And, of course, every key holder can
delete the car key on their device


180
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,690 line:-1
at any time.


181
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:35,095 line:-2
Certificates are the backbone
of car key life cycle management,


182
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,031 line:-2
so it's worth having a deeper look
to see how they work.


183
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:42,336 line:0
Let's start with the car certificate
embedded in the car


184
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:47,174 line:0
and the owner's key certificate
created on iPhone during owner pairing.


185
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:54,114 line:0
The automaker can issue car certificates
from a regional or brand-specific CA,


186
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,518 line:0
which is represented
by an optional intermediate certificate.


187
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,987 line:0
All intermediate certificates


188
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,924 line:0
should be trusted by a single
root certificate for an automaker.


189
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,396 line:0
The public key of this root certificate
is embedded in the owner key


190
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:11,098 line:0
during the owner pairing process.


191
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,935 line:0
The automaker public key
is required for key sharing,


192
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,370 line:0
as we'll see in a minute.


193
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:22,609 line:0
Each owner key is trusted by an instance
CA located on the Secure Element.


194
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,046 line:0
We create one instance CA per automaker.


195
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,349 line:0
Note that the subject name
of the instance CA


196
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,953 line:0
links the automaker app
to all car keys for this automaker.


197
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,924 line:0
The device is registered
with the automaker


198
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,959 line:0
using the instance CA identifier.


199
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,996 line:0
When the owner signs out of iCloud
or erases their device,


200
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,232 line:0
the instance CA is deleted,


201
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:48,769 line:0
and the automaker is no longer able
to identify the device.


202
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,637 line:0
This protects user privacy.


203
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,776 line:0
The instance CA is trusted
by the Apple root certificate.


204
00:12:56,376 --> 00:13:00,848 line:0
For each automaker, Apple will provide
the root certificate in a trusted way.


205
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,419 line:0
The automaker creates
the external CA certificate.


206
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,488 line:0
This certificate contains
the Apple root key


207
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,691 line:0
and is signed by the automaker.


208
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:15,028 line:0
The owner key is now trusted
by the automaker root.


209
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,866 line:0
The car is not required
to carry Apple's root certificate.


210
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,668 line:0
The automaker root certificate
is sufficient


211
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:25,372 line:0
to verify the authenticity
of a car key in a device.


212
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:30,711 line:0
The same certificates allow sharing
between secure elements.


213
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,814 line:0
The owner's iPhone sends an invitation


214
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:37,084 line:0
with a template for the friend's device
to create a key.


215
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:41,455 line:0
The friend's key is trusted
by the friend's instance CA.


216
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:46,326 line:0
The external CA connects the device
chain of trust to the automaker root.


217
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:51,565 line:0
As you remember, the owner key
embeds the automaker root


218
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:54,635 line:0
since it was provided by the car
at owner pairing.


219
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:59,773 line:0
The owner is now able to verify
the authenticity of a friend key.


220
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,843 line:-1
Now let's look into transactions.


221
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:08,081 line:-2
Fast and standard transaction
are variants of the same flow.


222
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:12,219 line:-2
The flow is designed to adapt seamlessly
to any situation.


223
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:16,056 line:-2
The standard transaction is used
to start the engine.


224
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:20,127 line:-2
It also creates the keys
for the fast transaction.


225
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,065 line:-2
We recommend to use the fast transaction
to unlock a car.


226
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,069 line:-2
When a friend key is used
for the first time,


227
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:33,273 line:-2
the door handle extends the fast
transaction to a standard transaction


228
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,544 line:-2
and adds an exchange command to read the
friend key attestation from the mailbox.


229
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,280 line:-1
Let's see how that works in detail.


230
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,151 line:-1
When a key is used for the first time,


231
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,788 line:-2
the car executes a standard transaction
on the door handle reader.


232
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,525 line:-2
For this, the car sends
its unique identifier


233
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:54,328 line:-1
and an ephemeral key to the device.


234
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:58,131 line:-2
The car identifier is created by you,
the automaker,


235
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:01,568 line:-2
to extract the real car identity,
such as the VIN.


236
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,671 line:-1
The device responds with an ephemeral key.


237
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,742 line:-2
For privacy protection,
the device does not send an identifier.


238
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,546 line:-1
To provide information about the new key,


239
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:15,148 line:-2
the device
must authenticate the car first.


240
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:20,120 line:-2
The symmetric keys for future
fast transactions on the door handle


241
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:22,456 line:-1
will now be calculated by the device.


242
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,360 line:-2
The device then sends
its encrypted key identifier


243
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,095 line:-1
and its signature to the car.


244
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,331 line:-2
At this moment
of the standard transaction,


245
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:34,902 line:-2
the car would normally authenticate
the device and start the engine.


246
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:39,239 line:-2
But as this is the first transaction
with an unknown key,


247
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:44,444 line:-2
the car checks if an attestation package
is present in the car key mailbox.


248
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,813 line:-1
If there's no friend attestation,


249
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,217 line:-2
then the user has most likely tapped
the device to the wrong car.


250
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,986 line:-1
But if there is a friend key attestation,


251
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:56,523 line:-2
then it is a new friend key
that the car doesn't know yet.


252
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:02,362 line:-2
The car will obtain the friend's public
key, access level, and the owner signature


253
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,697 line:-1
from the attestation.


254
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:08,769 line:-2
On successful validation, the car stores
all those elements and unlocks the door.


255
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,140 line:-2
Let's summarize
the security properties of transactions.


256
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:17,578 line:-2
In the fast transaction,
the car authenticates the device.


257
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,650 line:-2
Device tracking is not possible due to
the absence of any device identifier.


258
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,554 line:-2
All exchanged sensitive data
are encrypted.


259
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:33,360 line:-2
The standard transaction adds mutual
authentication between car and device.


260
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,530 line:-1
To protect the device against tracking,


261
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:40,934 line:-2
device identifiers are sent encrypted
only to a known car.


262
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:47,040 line:-2
Forward secrecy protects transaction data
against future compromise.


263
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:51,311 line:-2
Now that we've reviewed
the system architecture,


264
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,580 line:-1
let's talk about the radio technologies


265
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:56,917 line:-2
used to communicate
between iPhone and the car.


266
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:02,689 line:-2
NFC operates with a standard reader
in the door handle and inside the car.


267
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:09,195 line:-2
In addition, Apple's
Enhanced Contactless Protocol, or ECP,


268
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,031 line:-1
enables a truly magical experience.


269
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:17,738 line:-2
Whether you approach an NFC reader
on the car or a payment terminal,


270
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,840 line:-2
we'll automatically use the matching path
from Wallet.


271
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:26,512 line:-2
ECP works by identifying the reader type
and the make of the car


272
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,782 line:-1
before a transaction even starts.


273
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,987 line:-2
And fast and efficient reader polling
enables a good user experience.


274
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:40,861 line:-2
In the future, Ultra Wideband technology
will enable a truly passive entry system


275
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,829 line:-1
by providing secure ranging.


276
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:49,036 line:-2
Simply unlock and start your car
while iPhone stays in your bag or pocket.


277
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,140 line:-2
And because
the car key system is radio agnostic,


278
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:57,077 line:-2
everything we covered about key management
remains the same.


279
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:02,683 line:-2
The specification is currently
in draft form and will be available soon.


280
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:07,988 line:-2
Okay, let's move on
to talk about server integration.


281
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:11,358 line:-1
Although car keys work off-line,


282
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,461 line:-2
servers are required
for remote key management.


283
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:21,168 line:-2
First, your automaker server needs to
establish a reliable and secure connection


284
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:22,569 line:-1
to Apple's back end.


285
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,706 line:-2
This needs to be done
for each server environment,


286
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,508 line:-1
such as testing and production.


287
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:31,211 line:-2
Apple will provide
our car key root certificate


288
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,847 line:-1
to you, the automaker, for cross-signing.


289
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,951 line:-2
You send us back
your external CA certificate,


290
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:39,586 line:-1
root certificate,


291
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:43,590 line:-2
and certificate for privacy encryption
and signature verification.


292
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,928 line:-2
One set of certificates is required
for each server environment.


293
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:52,399 line:-2
We have defined a small set
of server interfaces


294
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,468 line:-1
that need to be implemented and tested.


295
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:59,106 line:-2
They allow you to register a new key,
remotely revoke keys,


296
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:01,508 line:-1
and send important device notifications.


297
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,246 line:-1
Passes represent your car keys in Wallet,


298
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,485 line:-2
provide logo and background artwork
to match your company brand.


299
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:15,722 line:-2
We supply a template and a portal
to make this easy for you.


300
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:20,394 line:-2
Wallet passes are created automatically,
so you don't need to write code here.


301
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:25,365 line:-2
Finally, your automaker app needs to
retrieve the owner pairing password


302
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,433 line:-1
from your back end.


303
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:29,736 line:-2
If you support deletion of keys
in your app,


304
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:33,173 line:-2
you will need to send
the termination request via your server.


305
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,444 line:-1
Let's talk more about automaker apps.


306
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:40,147 line:-1
With automaker apps,


307
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:44,017 line:-2
you can provide custom features
using keys stored in Wallet.


308
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:48,355 line:-2
Your automaker app is also
a great way to start owner pairing.


309
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:54,862 line:-2
The APIs are available to automakers only
and require an app entitlement.


310
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:59,066 line:-2
For more information,
see the PassKit documentation.


311
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,536 line:-2
There are many details
we didn't cover today,


312
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:06,373 line:-2
including communication protocols,
hardware features and more.


313
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:10,844 line:-2
If you're an automaker
and want to learn more,


314
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:16,817 line:-2
your first step is to enroll in
the Car Connectivity Consortium, or CCC,


315
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,952 line:-1
