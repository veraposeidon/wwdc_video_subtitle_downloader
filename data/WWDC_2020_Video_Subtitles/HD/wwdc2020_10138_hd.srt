1
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:07,274 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,011 line:0
Hello and welcome. My name is Danny Rust.


3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:13,213 line:0
I'm an EPM on the Customer Feedback team
here at Apple,


4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,516 line:0
and I'd like to thank you
for tuning in for our session.


5
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,418 line:-2
I'll be guiding you through
the first portion covering topics


6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,388 line:-2
including testing betas,
the AppleSeed for IT program


7
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,257 line:-1
and filing feedback for your organization,


8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,859 line:-2
which include a brief demo
before handing it off to Jared,


9
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:29,796 line:-2
who'll talk about the exciting new changes
regarding managing software updates.


10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,798 line:-1
Apple makes great tools for business.


11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,335 line:-2
Our tools and platforms help employees
solve problems in creative ways,


12
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:39,072 line:-2
be productive wherever they are
and collaborate more effectively.


13
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:42,242 line:-2
IT departments work incredibly hard
and with some key goals in mind:


14
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,980 line:-2
Test diligently to stay a step ahead
of emerging security concerns,


15
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,117 line:-2
ensure devices and apps
operate efficiently,


16
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,153 line:-1
minimize downtime and compatibility issues


17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,523 line:-2
and enable employees to have
the best user experience possible.


18
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,760 line:-2
To deliver on those goals,
key elements in your environment--


19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,864 line:-2
your IT infrastructure,
third-party MDM solution,


20
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,233 line:-1
Apple devices and business-critical apps--


21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,970 line:-2
must be ready when new software versions
are publicly released to your users.


22
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:13,140 line:-1
The truth is, we can't possibly replicate


23
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:16,243 line:-2
all the various education
and enterprise environments out there,


24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,380 line:-2
and we need your help to make sure you're
ready to deploy when the latest OS ships.


25
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:25,385 line:-2
Apple has many programs for seeding
pre-release software to developers,


26
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,555 line:-2
business and education customers
and other audiences.


27
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:32,326 line:-2
All these programs help users
provide valuable feedback to Apple.


28
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,061 line:-1
It's important to note some distinctions.


29
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:39,566 line:-2
The Public Beta is available to all users
who sign up at beta.apple.com


30
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:44,171 line:-2
and is generally geared towards reporting
livability or general use type issues.


31
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:47,307 line:-2
Updates in this program
can be less frequent.


32
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:52,312 line:-2
We currently support Public Betas
for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS


33
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,181 line:-1
and now this year, watchOS.


34
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,150 line:-1
The Developer Program's for app developers


35
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,286 line:-2
to incorporate new features
into their apps,


36
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:03,056 line:-2
use new frameworks,
test using simulators and various SDKs


37
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,692 line:-2
and make sure their apps run
on the new OS when it releases.


38
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,595 line:-1
And AppleSeed for IT.


39
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,764 line:-2
It's why you're here
and what I'll be discussing next.


40
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,400 line:-1
AppleSeed for IT is a seeding program


41
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:17,204 line:-2
focused towards IT professionals
in enterprise and education.


42
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,305 line:-1
In this program,


43
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:22,509 line:-2
Apple deploys a variety of software
across all platforms for you to test.


44
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,545 line:-1
We provide in-depth beta documentation


45
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,614 line:-2
and release notes
that are focused on IT admin workflows.


46
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,250 line:-1
Test plans are provided to ensure


47
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,486 line:-2
the newest features
work in your existing environment.


48
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:36,323 line:-2
The surveys are so you can help us
better understand that environment.


49
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,660 line:-2
We're committed to testing year-round
and we hope you are too.


50
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,094 line:-1
So, how can you help?


51
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,830 line:-2
Well, you have specific infrastructures,
mission-critical apps


52
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:47,801 line:-2
and services that are important
to your employees, staff and students.


53
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,637 line:-2
We need you to test against
your unique environments


54
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:54,575 line:-2
and provide feedback on what doesn't work
and what you'd like to see next.


55
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,444 line:-2
We are most interested in feedback
about deployment blockers,


56
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,247 line:-2
the kind of issues that would prevent you
from deploying the latest OS


57
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,815 line:-1
when we release it,


58
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:05,085 line:-2
and regressions, or things that don't work
in pre-released versions,


59
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,521 line:-1
but do work in the last public release.


60
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,624 line:-2
If you're ready to get started,
we've made it even easier to enroll.


61
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,559 line:-1
Simply use your Managed Apple ID.


62
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,895 line:-2
If you don't have one,
talk to your Apple Business Manager


63
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,898 line:-2
or Apple School Manager administrator
about generating one.


64
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:20,334 line:-2
Also, make sure to associate
your e-mail address on the account


65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,769 line:-2
to receive important communications
from the program.


66
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,274 line:-2
Next, log in to appleseed.apple.com
using your Managed Apple ID


67
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,276 line:-1
and accept the program terms.


68
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:32,813 line:-2
If you participated in AppleSeed for IT
last year, you'll do the same flow.


69
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,448 line:-1
Just sign in using your Managed Apple ID


70
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,250 line:-2
and accept
the new program terms for this year.


71
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,753 line:-2
Next, you'll configure your devices
to receive pre-released updates.


72
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,490 line:-2
You can push the configuration profile
or the macOS Customer Beta Access Utility


73
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,859 line:-1
to any device you want to use for testing.


74
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,562 line:-2
Both are available for download
on appleseed.apple.com


75
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,097 line:-1
under the Downloads tab.


76
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,299 line:-2
Remember that each participant
that's testing


77
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,335 line:-2
needs to sign in
and accept the program terms.


78
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,205 line:-2
Now, once you're started,
we want to encourage collaboration.


79
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,641 line:-2
You can communicate
with our AppleSeed for IT participants


80
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,743 line:-1
in the AppleSeed Discussion forums,


81
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,412 line:-2
and we encourage you to collaborate
with your teammates as well.


82
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,347 line:-2
This allows you to discuss
pre-release features


83
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,984 line:-2
with other participants
who have also accepted the program terms.


84
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,121 line:-2
Many of you likely have
existing contacts within Apple,


85
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:17,224 line:-2
either through your account team
or through AppleCare.


86
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,226 line:-2
It's important that you submit
all issues you encounter


87
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,494 line:-1
through Feedback Assistant.


88
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,230 line:-2
These other internal teams
can also assist during your testing.


89
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000 line:-2
With an AppleCare for Enterprise
or AppleCare OS Support agreement,


90
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,337 line:-2
you can request testing assistance
from an AppleCare Account Manager


91
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,139 line:-1
or an Apple Systems Engineer.


92
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:35,475 line:-2
These experienced Apple agents
can quickly guide you through testing,


93
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,445 line:-2
submitting feedback
and tracking any issues,


94
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,348 line:-2
and you can also notify them
about any deployment-blocking issues


95
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,350 line:-2
that you report
through the Feedback Assistant app.


96
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:48,021 line:-2
Next, I'd like to talk about how you can
file great feedback for your organization.


97
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,658 line:-2
These tips will help us
in triaging your issues more efficiently.


98
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,727 line:-2
Remember to file immediately
after the issue occurs


99
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,028 line:-1
with the device it occurs on


100
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,731 line:-2
as this will ensure
the necessary logs are gathered.


101
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:02,002 line:-2
When possible, note the time of the issue
and include thorough steps to reproduce,


102
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,606 line:-2
or if relevant, attach a screen recording
or a screenshot of the issue.


103
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,808 line:-1
Additionally, we host several profiles


104
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,110 line:-2
unique to enterprise
and education configurations


105
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,979 line:-2
to help gather
additional relevant logging.


106
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,416 line:-2
This year, we have some exciting new
features to share in Feedback Assistant,


107
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,086 line:-2
our application for filing feedback
on pre-released software.


108
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,521 line:-1
For that, I'd like to introduce Pete,


109
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,357 line:-2
who manages our engineers
responsible for Feedback Assistant.


110
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:27,961 line:-2
Feedback Assistant is available
on iOS, iPadOS, macOS and the web,


111
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,365 line:-2
and it helps you send us feedback
on your experiences with our software.


112
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,335 line:-2
It's designed to provide concise,
yet detailed forms to capture the problem,


113
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,304 line:-1
to collect system logs and diagnostics


114
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,907 line:-2
and to be the place for you
to keep track of your bugs


115
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,608 line:-1
as they work their way through Apple.


116
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,078 line:-2
One of our biggest feature requests
has been about collaboration.


117
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,981 line:-2
Organizations have told us how they
want to share information about bugs


118
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,783 line:-1
that affect more than one person.


119
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,853 line:-2
And when someone leaves the company,
their feedback goes with them.


120
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,391 line:-2
So, we're really proud to announce Teams,
new in this year's OS releases.


121
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,660 line:-2
Teams allows members
within an organization


122
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,628 line:-1
to work together on feedback with Apple.


123
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,398 line:-2
Teams are configured
by Apple Business Manager


124
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,900 line:-2
or Apple School Manager
for AppleSeed for IT,


125
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:09,236 line:-2
and in App Store Connect
for the Developer Program.


126
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:13,841 line:-2
Members of a team can see feedback
created by their teammates,


127
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,311 line:-2
see responses from Apple
and participate in that back-and-forth.


128
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,981 line:-2
And, when needed,
you can reassign a feedback


129
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,751 line:-2
so a different teammate gets notified
in case of vacation or departure.


130
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,655 line:-2
We've also done a lot of work
to help you provide better feedback


131
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,092 line:-2
in areas like Continuity, AirDrop
and syncing.


132
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,495 line:-2
Often, we need diagnostics from
both devices to figure out the problem.


133
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,533 line:-2
So, we've added a feature
we call multi-device diagnostics.


134
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,369 line:-2
When you start a new feedback
on your iOS device,


135
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,538 line:-2
Feedback Assistant
can remotely gather diagnostics


136
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,508 line:-2
from other devices
signed into your iCloud account.


137
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,211 line:-2
When you submit, the diagnostics upload
from each device directly to Apple,


138
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,980 line:-2
so you don't have to wait
for them to finish


139
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,349 line:-1
and sync over to the device you're using.


140
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,884 line:-1
Like Danny mentioned earlier,


141
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,187 line:-2
collecting logs right when
you see the problem really helps us,


142
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:04,424 line:-2
so now you can get all the logs
from all your devices all at once.


143
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,427 line:-2
Let's get into a demo
to see how this all works.


144
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,597 line:-2
Here's the main screen
of Feedback Assistant.


145
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,833 line:-1
I'm logged in using my Managed Apple ID.


146
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,934 line:-1
There's some new UI here.


147
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,336 line:-2
Organizing feedback
that belongs just to me


148
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,205 line:-1
and feedback that belongs to my team.


149
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,240 line:-1
Let's start by creating a new feedback.


150
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,412 line:-2
Here's the form to create a new feedback.
I'm going to make an iOS bug.


151
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,815 line:-2
I think it's relevant to my organization,
so I want to make it a team feedback.


152
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,886 line:-2
Choosing my team here makes sure
that the feedback I create


153
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,356 line:-2
will be visible to other members
of my organization in Feedback Assistant.


154
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,992 line:-1
Let's add a title.


155
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,262 line:-1
And this is a Continuity bug.


156
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,831 line:-1
And it's incorrect behavior.


157
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,402 line:-1
I had the problem with Safari.


158
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,638 line:-1
Between my iPhone and my iPad.


159
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,507 line:-1
On a very busy day.


160
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,409 line:-1
And I'll attach my screen recording later.


161
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,945 line:-1
Let's add the description.


162
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,049 line:-1
Okay. So, now it's time for attachments,


163
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,718 line:-2
so let's take advantage
of multi-device diagnostics.


164
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,988 line:-2
A sysdiagnose is already gathering
from this iPad,


165
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,791 line:-2
but I was using this iPhone
when I encountered the bug,


166
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,160 line:-2
so I think diagnostics from there
will be useful too.


167
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,095 line:-2
I can add them
using the Add Attachment button.


168
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,498 line:-1
I'll chose the iPhone that I was using...


169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,535 line:-1
add it to the feedback,


170
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,770 line:-2
and now it's collecting
a sysdiagnose as well.


171
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,075 line:-2
I want to move on,
so let's submit the feedback.


172
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,977 line:-1
Here's another new feature in iOS 14.


173
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,514 line:-2
You don't have to wait for diagnostics
to complete before sending your feedback.


174
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,549 line:-2
Feedback Assistant
will let me submit right now,


175
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,717 line:-1
and as long as my devices stay online,


176
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,287 line:-2
they'll upload the diagnostics to Apple
when they finish.


177
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,893 line:-2
Great. So, here's the feedback
in my team's Submitted box.


178
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,930 line:-2
If you've been
in the AppleSeed for IT program before,


179
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,765 line:-1
you probably filed some feedback.


180
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,501 line:-2
All that feedback
lives in your personal space.


181
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,603 line:-2
To let your teammates
collaborate on that feedback,


182
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,238 line:-1
you'll need to move it to the team space.


183
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,640 line:-1
Here's how you do that.


184
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:03,143 line:-2
This is the Submitted box
in my personal space.


185
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,946 line:-2
And here's a Wi-Fi bug
that I filed a few months ago.


186
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:08,649 line:-2
Now, I can make it visible
to the rest of my team.


187
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:14,054 line:-2
To do that, I use the More Actions button
up here and select Move to Team.


188
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:17,057 line:-2
Feedback Assistant will ask
for confirmation, and I'll go ahead.


189
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,461 line:-2
Now that you can see not just
your feedback but your team's as well,


190
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:24,665 line:-2
we've added some new areas to the app
to help you keep track of it all.


191
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,167 line:-2
We have multiple in-boxes
for organizing content


192
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,704 line:-2
that belongs just to me
and feedback that belongs to my team.


193
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,172 line:-1
At the top of the source list,


194
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,475 line:-2
we've added some smart boxes
to group certain kinds of content.


195
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,678 line:-1
For example, we have News.


196
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,280 line:-2
Here are the latest AppleSeed for IT
release notes.


197
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:43,650 line:-2
There's also Requests,
where I can see I have a survey to answer.


198
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,020 line:-1
Now, let's take a look at collaboration.


199
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,256 line:-1
Here's a bug filed by my colleague, Sean.


200
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,193 line:-2
You can see at the top,
the enhanced status.


201
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,762 line:-2
It looks like a lot of other people
had reported this bug,


202
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,731 line:-1
and it's showing that it's been fixed.


203
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,467 line:-1
So, a lot of us did see this bug.


204
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:04,204 line:-2
I remember it, and it's definitely fixed
in the latest release.


205
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,672 line:-1
If I look down at the bottom,


206
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,641 line:-2
here's a request from Apple
to verify that fix,


207
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,376 line:-1
and I can fill that out right here.


208
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,112 line:-1
Yes, it's resolved.


209
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,684 line:-2
So now, here's a feedback
from my teammate Monica, who just retired.


210
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,019 line:-1
Congratulations to her.


211
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:24,825 line:-2
She's not on the team anymore,
so she can't respond or see the feedback.


212
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:27,628 line:-2
That's indicated by the icon
to the left of her feedback.


213
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,230 line:-2
I want to reassign this feedback
to someone else on my team


214
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,766 line:-2
so they get notified
in case Apple has a response.


215
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,736 line:-2
Now, because I'm the administrator
for this team,


216
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,438 line:-2
I have some extra abilities on feedback
in my team space.


217
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,041 line:-2
I can reassign this feedback
to a different teammate.


218
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,043 line:-1
I'll assign it to Sean.


219
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,813 line:-2
Now, if Sean wants to send it
to somebody else,


220
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,049 line:-2
he can do that too,
as the current assignee.


221
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,120 line:-2
We have two other abilities
available only to administrators.


222
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:58,292 line:-2
Remove from Team moves the feedback
back into a submitter's personal space.


223
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,595 line:-2
And current assignees already have
the ability to close the feedback.


224
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,197 line:-1
But as an administrator,


225
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,800 line:-2
I can also close my teammate's feedback
when we're done with the bug.


226
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,938 line:-2
Teams functionality is available
in this year's iOS, iPadOS


227
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,372 line:-1
and macOS releases


228
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,075 line:-2
and on the web
at feedbackassistant.apple.com.


229
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:19,213 line:-2
Now, I'll hand it back to Danny
to talk about configuring team feedback.


230
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,314 line:-1
Thank you, Pete.


231
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,282 line:-2
For those of you wondering
how to start using Teams,


232
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,918 line:-2
there is some configuring available
on Apple Business Manager


233
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,720 line:-1
and Apple School Manager to discuss.


234
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,057 line:0
Within Apple Business Manager
or Apple School Manager,


235
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,359 line:0
please ensure
that roles you want to participate


236
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:35,462 line:0
have Participate in AppleSeed for IT
privilege enabled.


237
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,566 line:0
By default, this privilege is enabled
on all roles in Apple Business Manager.


238
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:43,103 line:-2
There must always be an AppleSeed for IT
administrator in your org.


239
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,874 line:-2
The Administer AppleSeed for IT privilege
is required for administrator roles


240
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,709 line:-1
and optional for people manager roles.


241
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,013 line:0
In Apple School Manager,
the Administer AppleSeed for IT privilege


242
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,415 line:0
is also mandatory
for the administrator role


243
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,785 line:0
and optional for the site manager
and people manager roles.


244
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:03,490 line:0
Participate in AppleSeed is enabled
by default on all roles except students,


245
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,192 line:0
which are excluded from testing.


246
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,860 line:-1
Let's recap.


247
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,162 line:-1
Testing keeps us both ahead of the curve.


248
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,598 line:-2
There are so many incredible ways
to use Apple's technology,


249
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:12,699 line:-1
and we need your help


250
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:16,170 line:-2
to ensure that your organization isn't
negatively impacted by the next release.


251
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,605 line:-1
The AppleSeed for IT program


252
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,708 line:-2
is focused on education and enterprise
IT departments,


253
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,044 line:-2
and we encourage you
to participate with us.


254
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,947 line:-1
And with Teams in Feedback Assistant,


255
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,550 line:-2
you can truly collaborate
on team-owned feedback.


256
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,886 line:-2
We're excited for you to try it out,
and we can't wait to hear your feedback.


257
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,988 line:-1
Now, I'd like to introduce Jared


258
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,790 line:-2
who'll be discussing
the exciting new changes


259
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,026 line:-1
around managing software updates.


260
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,361 line:-1
Thanks, Danny. My name is Jared,


261
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,531 line:-2
and I'm a software engineer
on the Installation Team at Apple.


262
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,200 line:-1
As my colleagues discussed earlier,


263
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,802 line:-2
it is critical for IT
and system administrators


264
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:52,139 line:-2
to be engaged in the development
of pre-release software.


265
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,807 line:-1
Your involvement during seeding


266
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:57,511 line:-2
ensures that you and your organization
will have a smooth transition


267
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:00,247 line:-2
into every update
that Apple ships to its users.


268
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:02,950 line:-2
Ideally, organizations should be
deploying updates


269
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,818 line:-1
as they are released by Apple.


270
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,987 line:-2
However, sometimes you need
a little extra time


271
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:09,857 line:-2
to qualify and deploy updates
throughout your organization.


272
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:13,093 line:0
This is where managing software updates
comes into play.


273
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,696 line:-1
Managing software updates


274
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,932 line:-2
puts you in control
over the deployment schedule of updates.


275
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,634 line:-1
It gives you time to verify


276
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:23,303 line:-2
that updates are compatible
with your company's workflow


277
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,105 line:-1
and existing propriety software.


278
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,275 line:-2
Although this qualification
should be done during seeding,


279
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,344 line:-1
sometimes more time is necessary.


280
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,847 line:-1
Enables IT to have a uniform understanding


281
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:36,717 line:-2
of what Apple software
is running on their devices.


282
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,318 line:-1
By having a deterministic insight


283
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,687 line:-2
into what software
in your organization is running,


284
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:45,158 line:-2
it empowers your team to deal with
the same sets of issues across devices.


285
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:48,195 line:-2
It's important to remember
that updates contain critical improvements


286
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:51,765 line:-2
in the areas of stability,
performance and security.


287
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,934 line:-2
Therefore,
organizations should do their best


288
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,303 line:-1
to deploy updates as swiftly as possible.


289
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,107 line:-2
Starting the installation
of a software update


290
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,877 line:-2
via Mobile Device Management,
also known as MDM,


291
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,813 line:-1
is a great choice for in-place upgrades.


292
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,917 line:-2
An MDM command can be sent
to supervised devices


293
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,286 line:-2
to download the latest qualifying version
from Apple.


294
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,390 line:-2
Administrators can specify
to download and stage the update,


295
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,659 line:-1
or to install the update as well.


296
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:22,696 line:-2
A phased rollout approach can be useful
to reduce network congestion.


297
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:25,799 line:-2
It is also advised to implement
content caching servers


298
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,635 line:-2
for organizations
with constrained Internet resources.


299
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:33,373 line:-2
It's important to note that only updates
that are still being signed by Apple


300
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,975 line:-1
are permitted for installation.


301
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:39,379 line:-2
It is also required
for devices to be enrolled in supervision


302
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,381 line:-1
in order to remotely update the device.


303
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:45,586 line:0
For iPhone and iPad,
if a device has a passcode,


304
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,355 line:0
that passcode will need to be
entered first by the user


305
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:49,957 line:0
before the installation begins.


306
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:55,395 line:-2
Let's start by talking about iOS,
iPadOS and tvOS.


307
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,633 line:-2
On these platforms,
Apple supports deferring software updates.


308
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,069 line:-1
This is controlled by MDM


309
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:05,539 line:-2
and can be deployed to supervised devices
or through a profile.


310
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,742 line:-1
If you choose to enable deferral,


311
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:12,379 line:-2
the default behavior
is to defer all updates for 30 days


312
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:14,781 line:-2
from the time
that Apple releases the update.


313
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:18,285 line:-2
The IT administrator
can also override this default


314
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:21,488 line:-2
and specify a value
between one to 90 days,


315
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:24,658 line:-2
so that you can pick
whatever schedule works best for you.


316
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:29,530 line:-2
Once the deferral window has expired,
the next update is evaluated


317
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,733 line:-2
and is either presented for installation
or is also deferred.


318
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,471 line:-2
Deferral windows are determined by date,
not by release version number.


319
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,607 line:-1
Once an update has been installed,


320
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:44,178 line:-2
it is not possible to downgrade
without erasing the device.


321
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:48,849 line:-2
Apple only supports updating devices
to newer versions of the OS.


322
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,485 line:-2
Apple signs its software
for production use,


323
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:53,620 line:-1
and older releases may be revoked


324
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:57,024 line:-2
to ensure that customers
are not susceptible to downgrade attacks.


325
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,426 line:-2
Therefore,
if an erase install is performed,


326
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,028 line:-1
it may be rejected by Apple


327
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,697 line:-2
if the version being erased
has been revoked by Apple.


328
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,135 line:-2
Typically, when a user
navigates into the Settings app


329
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:11,338 line:-2
and taps on Software Update
in iOS or iPadOS,


330
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,473 line:-1
they'll be presented with this screen.


331
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,311 line:-2
As you may note, the user has full control
over their own update experience.


332
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,814 line:-2
When you implement
the managed software update restriction,


333
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:24,284 line:-2
you'll see this screen instead
if an update is presently being deferred.


334
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,924 line:-2
On macOS, software updates control
more than just operating system updates,


335
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:34,795 line:-2
it also controls out-of-band updates
such as Safari.


336
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:38,999 line:-2
Therefore, we provide extra options
through the MDM interface.


337
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:42,569 line:-2
An administrator can schedule a scan
across their fleet,


338
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:45,639 line:-2
fetch the list of available updates
for all Macs,


339
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:50,444 line:-2
get the status of all updates in progress
and schedule updates for installation.


340
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,947 line:-2
The remote management of updates
requires the device to be supervised.


341
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:58,685 line:0
On the Mac,
the automatic checking for updates,


342
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,754 line:0
download and installation


343
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,190 line:0
is controlled by the settings
that the user has specified


344
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:06,226 line:0
in the Software Update Preference pane
in System Preferences.


345
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,164 line:0
These settings can be controlled via MDM
and are fully manageable.


346
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:15,402 line:0
IT Administrators are empowered to make
software update settings a user choice,


347
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,770 line:0
or to fully override them.


348
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,175 line:-2
For macOS, the deferral process
is similar to the iOS process


349
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,943 line:-1
as we've discussed earlier.


350
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,747 line:-2
You can deploy a configuration profile
to delay updates for up to 90 days.


351
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,050 line:-2
But here are some unique things
about the Mac.


352
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,054 line:-2
Deferred updates are transparent
to the user in System Preferences.


353
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,290 line:-2
Once an update
has passed its deferral window,


354
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,759 line:-2
the user
will receive a notification to update


355
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,628 line:-2
and the update will become visible
in System Preferences.


356
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:46,934 line:-2
The Mac does not need to be supervised
in order to defer software updates.


357
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,870 line:-2
A config profile can be installed
to control these settings.


358
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:55,509 line:-2
Updates are automatically deferred
by date, not by their version number.


359
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:58,879 line:-2
This allows the deferral
of multiple OS Updates in succession


360
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:01,181 line:-2
rather than only deferring
one update at a time.


361
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:07,221 line:-2
For example, it is possible to defer
10.16.1 and 10.16.2


362
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:10,624 line:-1
while 10.16.3 is currently released.


363
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:13,393 line:-2
As long as it has not been
greater than 90 days


364
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,562 line:-1
since the update was released by Apple.


365
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,365 line:-1
In prior releases of macOS,


366
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,934 line:-2
it was not possible
to defer software updates


367
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,769 line:-1
while an update was in seeding.


368
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:27,207 line:-2
Let's take a closer look at how you might
choose to manage software updates.


369
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,377 line:-1
In this example, macOS 10.16


370
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,913 line:-2
will be released
for approximately 30 days.


371
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,982 line:-1
Please note that this is only an example.


372
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:38,519 line:-2
Typically, before Apple
chooses to release an update,


373
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,654 line:-1
it undergoes rigorous beta testing.


374
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:42,856 line:-2
This is the time at which you should
start getting involved


375
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:44,958 line:-2
in testing the release
against your workflows.


376
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:47,528 line:-2
By qualifying your environment
during seeding,


377
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,162 line:-1
gives you time, and Apple,


378
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,865 line:-2
to fix any issues that are discovered
before the release ships.


379
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:57,037 line:-2
Now, on day 30, Apple has decided
that macOS 10.16.1


380
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:58,705 line:-1
is ready to ship to the public.


381
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:01,775 line:-2
This is exciting because the bugs that
you've been filing with Feedback Assistant


382
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:03,710 line:-1
may now be fixed.


383
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:06,747 line:-2
Now it's time to certify the final build
against your environment.


384
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,016 line:-2
This is the time
to defer the software update.


385
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:11,752 line:-2
Preferably for as short of a time
as possible.


386
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,422 line:-2
The update is then pushed out
to your environment...


387
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:18,292 line:-1
and then the cycle continues.


388
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:22,062 line:-1
We want IT and enterprises


389
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,331 line:-2
engaged in testing the features
that they know and love


390
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:26,867 line:-2
before they are deployed
to their organization.


391
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:30,270 line:-2
Therefore, we are bringing support
for deferring software updates


392
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:33,073 line:-1
while macOS Big Sur is undergoing seeding.


393
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:37,110 line:-2
Administrators are encouraged to try out
the deferral of software updates


394
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,713 line:-2
and to file us feedback
using Feedback Assistant


395
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,583 line:-2
if they find any issues
with the deferral of updates.


396
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:47,020 line:-2
In addition, we received tons of feedback
from Mac admins


397
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:50,390 line:-2
requesting the ability
to defer major releases of macOS.


398
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:53,727 line:-1
As of macOS Catalina 10.15.4,


399
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:56,463 line:-2
we introduced the ability
to defer major releases


400
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,466 line:-2
under the same deferral window
as other software updates.


401
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,604 line:-2
We plan on improving this in the future,
and we value your feedback.


402
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,372 line:-1
In macOS Big Sur,


403
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:08,876 line:-2
we have some exciting new security changes
that better protect our users.


404
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,446 line:-2
This year, we have unified
our installation technology


405
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,348 line:-1
across all of our platforms.


406
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:18,819 line:-2
The Mac now uses the same reliable
and secure installation technology as iOS.


407
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,890 line:-2
In addition, we are snapshotting
the system volume.


408
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,425 line:-2
This enables
a quicker software update experience


409
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:29,263 line:-2
since the system snapshot is patched
while the user is using their Mac.


410
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,764 line:-1
This is similar to the experience


411
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:33,934 line:-2
iOS and iPadOS users
have come to know and love.


412
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,771 line:-2
We are also
cryptographically sealing those snapshots


413
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,940 line:-1
using authenticated APFS.


414
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:41,842 line:-1
This enables us to verify on boot


415
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,745 line:-2
that the user's system matches
what was delivered by Apple.


416
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,947 line:-1
As file system blocks are read from disk,


417
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:50,584 line:-2
they are hashed up the file system chain
and compared to the root hash.


418
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:53,187 line:-2
If the root hash does not match
what was signed by Apple,


419
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,788 line:-1
the seal is considered broken


420
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:57,191 line:-2
and the device's kernel
will immediately panic.


421
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,161 line:-2
On macOS, we realize
that there are power users and researchers


422
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:03,697 line:-2
that want to be able to modify
the system volume.


423
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,700 line:-2
Therefore, Apple is permitting
authenticated APFS


424
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:10,270 line:-2
to be disabled by modifying
your security settings in the recovery OS,


425
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:11,805 line:-1
though this is strongly discouraged.


426
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:17,578 line:-2
Lastly, the qualification of OS updates
is now server-driven as it is on iOS.


427
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,279 line:-1
With these exciting new changes,


428
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:22,015 line:-2
we are deprecating some
less commonly used technologies.


429
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,651 line:-2
In macOS Big Sur,
we have removed the ability


430
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:27,054 line:-1
for third-party software update catalogs.


431
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,591 line:-2
As it is on iOS, the installation catalog
is managed by Apple.


432
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:35,062 line:-2
We are also dropping support
for deferring updates indefinitely.


433
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,496 line:-1
As we have discussed,


434
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:40,434 line:-2
updates contain critical reliability,
performance and security updates.


435
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:43,937 line:-2
Therefore, we want our users
to be on the latest software possible.


436
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:48,208 line:-2
For macOS Catalina and macOS Mojave,
we will be reintroducing support


437
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:52,779 line:-2
for ignoring updates
in the 10.15.6 aligned security releases


438
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:55,682 line:-2
as long as those devices
are under supervision.


439
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:59,553 line:-2
However, in macOS Big Sur,
and moving forward,


440
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,389 line:-2
ignoring updates indefinitely
is no longer supported.


441
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:06,460 line:-2
We are strongly encouraging you
to utilize update deferral


442
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:08,028 line:-1
and participate in seeding.


443
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:11,665 line:-2
As a reminder,
make sure to actively participate


444
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,133 line:-1
in pre-release software.


445
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,368 line:-1
Get your feedback in early


446
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:17,638 line:-2
to ensure your organization is ready
for the upcoming release.


447
00:22:18,372 --> 00:22:22,809 line:-2
Join AppleSeed for IT to gain access
to in-depth documentation and resources.


448
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,779 line:-1
Work with your extended Apple contacts


449
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,782 line:-2
such as your account team, sales team
or AppleCare.


450
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:32,920 line:-2
Make sure to utilize
Feedback Assistant extensively.


451
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:36,356 line:-2
Apple values your feedback,
and by providing feedback early,


452
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:39,259 line:-2
we can get your issues resolved
before the release ships.


453
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:43,730 line:-2
Take control over the software
that is deployed in your organization


454
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,699 line:-1
by managing software updates,


455
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,568 line:-1
and limit the usage of update deferral


456
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:51,939 line:-2
by certifying your workflows early
by participating in pre-release software.


457
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,910 line:0
Check out these other exciting sessions
for more on managing Apple devices.


458
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:59,746 line:-2
Thank you,
and on behalf of everyone at Apple,


459
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:03,050 line:-1
we hope that you have a fantastic WWDC.
