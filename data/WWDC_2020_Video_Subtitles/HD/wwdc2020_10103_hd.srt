00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,673 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,710 line:0
Welcome to "Design Great Widgets."


3
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,813 line:0
My name is Mac and I'm joined later
by my colleague, Christian,


4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,416 line:0
and we both work on the Human Interface
Design Team here at Apple.


5
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,318 line:0
We're really excited
to talk through the process


6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,388 line:0
of how you can design amazing widgets
for your own apps.


7
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,758 line:0
But before we get started,
let's take a quick look at what's new.


8
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:30,764 line:0
In iOS 14, the entire widget experience
has been completely redesigned.


9
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:33,767 line:0
At its foundation
is an entirely new visual aesthetic


10
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,903 line:-1
and powerful new capabilities.


11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,372 line:-2
The information
your widget chooses to surface


12
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,974 line:-2
can be more up-to-date
and contextual than ever,


13
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,344 line:-2
and drag and drop editing gives people
direct control over their widgets


14
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,380 line:-1
in an intuitive and flexible way.


15
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,250 line:-2
One of the things
we're really excited about


16
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,119 line:-2
is that people can now
add these new widgets


17
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,588 line:-1
directly onto their Home Screen pages.


18
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,791 line:-2
This enables an all-new way
for users to experience widgets


19
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,460 line:-2
and, likewise, a whole new
set of considerations to think about


20
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,029 line:-1
as you approach designing them.


21
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,498 line:-2
Another feature we've created
is Smart Stacks.


22
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,402 line:-2
These let you add several
different widgets into a single location


23
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,505 line:-2
and quickly flick between
the different widgets inside.


24
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,907 line:-2
But what is really powerful
is that Smart Stacks


25
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:17,477 line:-2
dynamically change and adapt
to how you use them.


26
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,948 line:-2
Based on your behavior and context,
a Smart Stack will automatically rotate


27
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,684 line:-2
to show you the most relevant widget
at a given time.


28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,019 line:-2
So the information you are looking for
is already there


29
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,955 line:-1
before you even have to lift a finger.


30
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,757 line:0
For example, when I wake up,


31
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,660 line:0
I like to know what the weather
is going to be for the day.


32
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:38,232 line:0
When I'm on my way to work, I always play
some of my favorite recent music.


33
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,566 line:0
Later, in the afternoon,


34
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:43,971 line:0
I often check how much traffic there is
and how long it might take me to get home.


35
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,073 line:0
And in the evening,
I like to catch up and read through


36
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,208 line:0
some of the top news stories from the day.


37
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,144 line:-2
These are just some examples
from my own widget stack,


38
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,347 line:-2
but the widgets and behaviors
of the Smart Stack


39
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,650 line:-2
are different for each person
based on the way they use their device


40
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,819 line:-2
and the information
that matters most to them.


41
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:01,788 line:-2
This was a super quick look
at some of what's new,


42
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,157 line:-2
but it's important to remember
all of these different ways


43
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,026 line:-1
someone can interact with your widget,


44
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,262 line:-2
and we'll revisit certain features
more deeply


45
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,697 line:-2
as they pertain to different sections
of the design process.


46
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:15,402 line:-2
When designing a widget, there are
two main parts of the process to focus on:


47
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,404 line:-1
ideation and creation.


48
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:19,873 line:-1
In this first section,


49
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,576 line:-2
we're going to cover some principles
to help guide your ideas


50
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,378 line:-1
and also look at some of the new features


51
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,047 line:-2
that are important to consider
at this step in the process.


52
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,816 line:-1
Starting with design principles.


53
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,586 line:-2
The new widget system
is all about content.


54
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,688 line:-2
To create a great widget,
you need to understand


55
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,124 line:-2
what the most useful information
and experiences are


56
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,625 line:-1
that people return to your app for.


57
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,528 line:-2
Three useful principles
we've found to focus on


58
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,964 line:-2
when thinking about ideas
is to look for things


59
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,934 line:-2
that are personal,
informational and contextual.


60
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,336 line:-2
We want to look for things
that are personal


61
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,572 line:-2
because it can allow for
a deeper emotional connection


62
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,342 line:-2
with a piece of your app or
an experience that it enables for someone.


63
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,813 line:-2
Widgets provide a great way
to see a top-level overview of information


64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,649 line:-2
from a variety of sources
on someone's device.


65
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,084 line:-1
Surfacing the right information


66
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,321 line:-2
can save people from doing
commonly repeated actions in your app.


67
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,124 line:-2
People have their devices with them
throughout the day,


68
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,528 line:-2
and there are tons of signals
to infer a person's circumstances.


69
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:18,265 line:-2
Context helps surface
the right information at the right moment


70
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,667 line:-2
and allows for a better experience
that, at its best,


71
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,837 line:-2
feels like is magically predicting
someone's needs and next steps.


72
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,974 line:-2
Let's take a look
at how some of these principles


73
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,611 line:-2
informed our decisions and ideas
while designing some of our own widgets.


74
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,714 line:-1
For Calendar, just like the app icon,


75
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,517 line:-2
it shows the day of the week
and the current date.


76
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,686 line:-2
Your next meeting or event was
the most important piece of information


77
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,922 line:-1
to surface from within the app.


78
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,125 line:-2
Glanceable details like the start time
and event location


79
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:49,329 line:-2
save people a potential step in
opening the app to find this information.


80
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,765 line:-2
If you have a busy schedule
with lots of events,


81
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,067 line:-2
it collapses
some of the less relevant information


82
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,137 line:-2
and prioritizes the single
most important piece of information


83
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,672 line:-1
from each event.


84
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,542 line:-2
When your day is almost over
and there's no more events,


85
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,378 line:-2
rather than just showing a blank widget,
when possible,


86
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,747 line:-2
we instead start telling you
about what is coming up next


87
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,882 line:-1
and happening in your day tomorrow.


88
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:12,786 line:-2
This is a great example of thinking beyond
just the context of the current moment


89
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,122 line:-2
and broadening the scope
of contextual relevance


90
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,458 line:-1
by the hour, day or even week.


91
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,826 line:-1
A more personal detail


92
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,563 line:-2
is the holiday calendar
for the country that you live in.


93
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,332 line:-2
It adds a nice reminder
on special holidays.


94
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,934 line:-1
And when it's a contact's birthday,


95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,636 line:-2
we show a present glyph
and elevate it at the top,


96
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:30,938 line:-1
so right from your Home Screen,


97
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,007 line:-2
you can feel a personal connection to them
during their birthday.


98
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,411 line:-1
The Photos widget is a great example


99
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,080 line:-2
of just how personal
a widget experience can be.


100
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,882 line:-2
We found that
the most delightful experience


101
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,319 line:-2
was to surface the best photos
instead of just the most recent ones.


102
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:49,523 line:-2
In addition to photo memories,
we also surface featured photos,


103
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,959 line:-2
and another way
of taking advantage of context


104
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,028 line:-2
was to show you photo memories
from the current day in years past.


105
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,132 line:-2
In the Weather widget,
we surface the city name,


106
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,602 line:-2
current temperature,
including the high and low,


107
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,604 line:-2
and what the forecast will be
for the rest of the day


108
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,072 line:-1
in your current location.


109
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,142 line:-2
Weather is a really great example
of how contextual a widget can be.


110
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,580 line:-2
We display unique weather events
such as high wind, thunderstorms


111
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,449 line:-2
and if and when
it's going to start raining.


112
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:19,920 line:-2
And if it does, we contextually increase
the resolution of the next hour's forecast


113
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,822 line:-1
so you can see up-to-the-minute detail


114
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,259 line:-2
of when there might be a break in
the downpour or when it will stop raining.


115
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:31,265 line:-2
For Maps, it's useful
to be oriented geographically


116
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,766 line:-1
and see what's around you.


117
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,736 line:-2
But we build on top of
this base spatial awareness.


118
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,871 line:-2
When you're not at home
and you've driven somewhere,


119
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,873 line:-1
we show where your parked car is.


120
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,876 line:-2
And if you have a scheduled event,
we show how long it will take to get there


121
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,279 line:-2
and contextualize the map
so you see the route you will take


122
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,747 line:-1
and what's on the way.


123
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,450 line:-2
When you're not at home, we show the ETA
for how long it will take to get back.


124
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,487 line:-1
You can see how, in all of these examples,


125
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,923 line:-2
the widgets are very dynamic
and informative,


126
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,859 line:-2
and the contextual details
make the experience feel very personal


127
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,594 line:-1
and adaptive to a person's needs.


128
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:05,432 line:-2
One of the new capabilities
is the ability for people to edit widgets.


129
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,435 line:-2
This is an important concept
to think about in the ideation phase


130
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,704 line:-2
because it might change
how much information


131
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,706 line:-1
you try to put into a single widget.


132
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:16,009 line:-2
Let's take a look at how editing works
for the Weather widget.


133
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,948 line:-2
In iOS 14, your widgets will jiggle
just like apps do in edit mode,


134
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,483 line:-2
and you can tap on a widget here
to flip it around


135
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,419 line:-1
and see what it allows for you to edit.


136
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,921 line:-1
Here, the Weather widget lets me change


137
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:31,258 line:-2
what location it's displaying
the weather conditions for.


138
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,493 line:-2
By default,
it adapts to your current location,


139
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,297 line:-2
so that when a person adds a widget,
they don't have to do any additional work.


140
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,666 line:-1
If I tap on the location field,


141
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,935 line:-2
I get a list
of all of my Favorite Weather cities,


142
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,404 line:-2
as well as the ability
to search for other locations.


143
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,308 line:-2
I'm going to change the location display
on this widget to Tokyo.


144
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,911 line:-1
And when the widget flips back around,


145
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:54,014 line:-2
it's now displaying the weather conditions
and information for that city.


146
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,682 line:-1
But what is really cool


147
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,553 line:-2
is widgets in iOS 14 let you add
as many additional widgets as you want


148
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,089 line:-2
and edit each one to show
a different set of information.


149
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,525 line:-1
Here, I'll add a second Weather widget,


150
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,194 line:-2
and change this one
to show San Francisco's conditions.


151
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,898 line:-1
One of the best parts of this feature


152
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,800 line:-2
is that it eliminates the need
to create complex widget layouts


153
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,936 line:-2
that represent
different entities of information


154
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,671 line:-1
combined into a single widget,


155
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:22,075 line:-2
and instead, lets a person choose how much
information they want to see from your app


156
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,410 line:-1
by adding several widgets


157
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,879 line:-2
and editing them to show
just what they want to keep track of.


158
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,917 line:-1
Now, I can have both cities side by side.


159
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,953 line:-2
Most of the new widgets in iOS
support editing like this,


160
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,523 line:-2
and it's a great experience to add
and choose different Reminders lists,


161
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,693 line:-2
Stocks, Notes
and world clocks, as shown here.


162
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,664 line:-2
This is one of the main use cases
of configuration,


163
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,532 line:-1
but there can be others too.


164
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,935 line:-2
Consider what options
you could offer to people


165
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,070 line:-2
that would maximize
the utility and flexibility


166
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,738 line:-1
that people might get out of your widget.


167
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,676 line:-2
Another thing to consider
in the ideation process


168
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,212 line:-2
is deciding on
if you should offer multiple widgets.


169
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,849 line:-1
For Stocks, we had two different ideas:


170
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,551 line:-2
to offer a widget that shows
a glanceable compact summary


171
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,486 line:-1
of your watch list information,


172
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:09,957 line:-2
but also the ability to add
a single stock symbol as a separate widget


173
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,059 line:-1
to keep track of it at a higher resolution


174
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,862 line:-2
just like Weather did for cities
in the previous example.


175
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,999 line:-2
Several other apps in iOS 14
offer multiple widgets,


176
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:22,736 line:-2
including News, which lets you follow
top news from a specific topic,


177
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,805 line:-2
and Notes,
that lets you pin a favorite note


178
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,240 line:-1
or add a Shared Note Folder.


179
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,744 line:-2
Now that we've taken you through
some important principles


180
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:34,448 line:-2
and considerations to think through when
coming up with ideas for your widgets,


181
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,284 line:-2
in the next part, Christian is going to
talk through the process


182
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:40,587 line:-2
of how to take these ideas
and form them into beautiful widgets


183
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,890 line:-2
that express
all that your app has to offer


184
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,992 line:-1
in an elegant and consistent way.


185
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,160 line:-1
Thanks, Mac. My name is Christian,


186
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:50,130 line:-2
and I'm excited to take you through
how to make your widgets come to life.


187
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,433 line:-2
Let's jump into the details
of creating your widget.


188
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,270 line:-2
There's three things we're going to cover
as part of creation.


189
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,872 line:-1
The first is sizes and interactions.


190
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,709 line:-2
The new system supports three sizes
that you can design with:


191
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:07,247 line:-1
small, medium and large.


192
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,583 line:-1
We designed the small widget


193
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,419 line:-2
to be all about the most useful
piece of content from your app


194
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:15,756 line:-2
in a size that constrains
how much content can actually fit in it.


195
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,358 line:-2
The small widget supports
a single tap target.


196
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,862 line:-2
Tapping it should deep link
to the content that's on the widget.


197
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,665 line:-2
Where you deep link to
will depend on how your app is structured.


198
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,700 line:-1
Let look at some examples.


199
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,436 line:-1
For our small Calendar widget,


200
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:32,306 line:-2
since the widget is always showing
what event is coming up next,


201
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,775 line:-2
we thought it made the most sense
to bring you to the latest event


202
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,109 line:-1
in the app's day view.


203
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,947 line:-2
When you tap on the widget,
the day view scrolls to the latest event


204
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,649 line:-2
and gives you a nice glimpse
of the rest of your day around it.


205
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,086 line:-1
For our small News widget,


206
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,456 line:-2
since it previews a rich news story
that you might be interested in reading,


207
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:52,426 line:-2
tapping it brings you
directly to that news story in the app.


208
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,064 line:0
Our medium and large widgets
are familiar shapes.


209
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,534 line:0
Both sizes fit more content
and support multiple tap targets.


210
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,404 line:-2
Tapping a piece of content
in a medium or large widget


211
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,674 line:-2
should also deep link you to the displayed
content that's on the widget,


212
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,676 line:-1
like here in this News example.


213
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:13,180 line:-2
Tapping either article brings you directly
to the news story you tapped on.


214
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:17,651 line:-2
There's three different tap styles
supported in the widget system.


215
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,286 line:-1
Fill style is best


216
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:22,322 line:-2
for when you're deep linking
into a single piece of content.


217
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:26,226 line:-2
Every small widget uses fill style
since it only supports one tap target.


218
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,164 line:-2
Cell style is best
for when you're selecting


219
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,767 line:-2
a piece of content in a widget
that lives in its own shape,


220
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,435 line:-1
like here in our Files widget.


221
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,940 line:-2
And content style is great for when
you're selecting a piece of content


222
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,808 line:-1
that lives uncontained in a widget.


223
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,880 line:-1
Next is all about content and personality.


224
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,416 line:-2
The most important part
about making your widget come to life


225
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,684 line:-1
is what lives in it.


226
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,719 line:-2
You should think about content
and personality together


227
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,087 line:-1
when you're designing your widget.


228
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:55,956 line:-1
Ask yourself questions like,


229
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,492 line:-2
"What are people looking for
when they launch my app?"


230
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,062 line:-2
Also find distinct items of information
that people find useful in your app.


231
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,599 line:-2
Let's look at a few examples of thinking
about content and personality together.


232
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,668 line:-1
When designing our widget set,


233
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,871 line:-2
we looked at finding personality
through how our apps look.


234
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,607 line:-2
For Weather, we used the familiar
weather condition background,


235
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,642 line:-1
as well as the iconography from the app.


236
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,213 line:-2
For News, we took inspiration
from the rich story images


237
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,614 line:-1
that you see in news stories.


238
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,283 line:-1
And for Calendar, we took inspiration


239
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,119 line:-2
from its simplistic look
and familiar red tint color,


240
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,622 line:-2
focusing all on what events
are coming up next.


241
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:33,527 line:-2
Another approach for finding personality
is taking inspiration from your app icon.


242
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:38,198 line:-2
Like Notes, where we took on
the icon's notepad illustration style,


243
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:41,602 line:-2
Podcasts, where we used
the icon's purple gradient,


244
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,171 line:-2
and Tips, where we used
the icon's yellow gradient.


245
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,673 line:-2
When it comes to
laying out content in your widget,


246
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,510 line:-2
there were two patterns we found
when designing our widget set.


247
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,813 line:-2
The first is a layout
that expands across all three sizes,


248
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,984 line:-2
like Weather, where we add
additional information across each size.


249
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,121 line:-2
The second is a layout
that is completely unique across sizes,


250
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,389 line:-1
like News here.


251
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,792 line:-2
The small widget prioritizes rich content
that fills up the whole space,


252
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,896 line:-2
while the medium widget
focuses on showing more news stories.


253
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,832 line:-1
When you're designing for each size,


254
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,169 line:-2
make sure not to scale up your
smaller widget into your larger widget.


255
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,004 line:-2
Think about the information
you're working with


256
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,139 line:-2
and what makes the most sense
for each size.


257
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,575 line:-1
For the large Screen Time widget,


258
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:25,179 line:-2
since we had more useful information
that we could include and more space,


259
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,780 line:-1
we increased the size of the chart


260
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,783 line:-2
and also included category
and app details.


261
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,120 line:-2
If you don't have more information to show
in your larger sizes, though,


262
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:36,456 line:-2
it's fine to only support
specific sizes of your idea.


263
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,759 line:-1
All sizes for an idea aren't required.


264
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,728 line:-2
You might come up with an idea
like these examples here


265
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,698 line:-2
where you want to pack a summary
of information in a small widget.


266
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,768 line:-2
We recommend only including
a max of four pieces of information


267
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,203 line:-1
in the small widget size.


268
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,107 line:-2
Now, let's go into some more detail
about widget patterns.


269
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,944 line:-1
As we designed our widgets,


270
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,479 line:-2
there were several common layout patterns
that emerged.


271
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:03,383 line:-2
Here they are across the different
small, medium and large sizes.


272
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:07,454 line:-2
There are a mix of single-item
and denser multi-item summary layouts.


273
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,257 line:-2
These patterns serve
as a helpful starting place


274
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:13,460 line:-2
and a good way to try out an idea
in a format that already works well.


275
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:19,166 line:-2
When designing your own custom layouts,
follow the default 16pt layout margins


276
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:22,302 line:-2
across all sizes to make sure the content
in your widget feels consistent


277
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,104 line:-1
when it's placed next to other widgets.


278
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,041 line:-2
For layouts with graphical shapes
like circles and inset platters,


279
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:31,478 line:-1
use tighter 11pt margins across all sizes.


280
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,847 line:-2
Shape corners that sit
close to the edges of your widget


281
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:36,850 line:-2
should appear concentric
with the widget's corner radius.


282
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:40,320 line:-2
Since the widget's corner radius
changes across different device sizes,


283
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,891 line:-2
we provide a SwiftUI container that
you can assign to shapes in your widget


284
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,326 line:-2
that will make them concentric
with the widget's corner radius


285
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,129 line:-2
without needing to manually specify
corner radius values.


286
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:51,999 line:-1
For type, you should use SF Pro,


287
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,301 line:-2
or other variants of San Francisco
that are available


288
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:57,037 line:-1
like SF Mono and SF Pro Rounded.


289
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,739 line:-1
If a custom font is important


290
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,408 line:-2
to how your widget
represents its brand or personality,


291
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,976 line:-1
make sure it's applied in a way


292
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,712 line:-2
so that your widget still feels at home
alongside other widgets.


293
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:10,050 line:-2
A widget should look great
in both Light and Dark appearance modes.


294
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:13,453 line:-2
For Calendar, the whole widget changes
between Light and Dark appearances


295
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,888 line:-1
just like its app does.


296
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,125 line:-2
For Podcasts,
since the whole background is a gradient,


297
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,594 line:-1
it already works nicely in both modes.


298
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:23,597 line:-2
And for Notes,
it has a mix of bold colors and white,


299
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,433 line:-2
so we adopt the note contents
for the darkened appearance mode


300
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,569 line:-2
to reflect how the note appears
in the app.


301
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,405 line:-1
Every widget must provide a placeholder


302
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:35,042 line:-2
which is shown when the system has no way
of displaying your widget's data.


303
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,411 line:-2
You should show
the base graphical elements in this state


304
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,714 line:-2
and block-in areas of text where
your information is shown in the layout.


305
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,085 line:-2
This way, when the system
goes from placeholder to the proper data,


306
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,987 line:-2
the content can replace
the static elements


307
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,323 line:-2
without having the layout or color
shift around.


308
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,626 line:-1
The last thing we want to go over


309
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:55,729 line:-2
are a handful of tips to keep in mind
when you're designing your widgets.


310
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,899 line:-1
You should only use a logo in your widget


311
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:02,035 line:-2
if your app is an aggregator of content
from different sources,


312
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,537 line:-1
like these examples here.


313
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,875 line:-2
To keep this treatment consistent
across different widgets,


314
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:10,744 line:-2
your logo should always sit
in the top right corner.


315
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:14,281 line:-2
Avoid using wordmarks in this space
and anywhere else in your widget.


316
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,252 line:-2
Another thing to avoid
is putting your app icon in your widget.


317
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,054 line:-2
Also avoid putting your app name
in your widget


318
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,856 line:-2
as it will feel redundant
with the app label


319
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,459 line:-2
that already appears underneath of it
on the Home Screen.


320
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,496 line:-2
Don't put text that instructs a user
or talks to them.


321
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:32,399 line:-2
Instead, if you feel there is
something important to communicate,


322
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:33,734 line:-1
do it in a graphical way.


323
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:37,037 line:-2
When displaying
chronological information on a widget,


324
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,973 line:-2
don't use language like "last updated"
or "last checked."


325
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,510 line:-2
We've talked through
where to start with your idea,


326
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:46,947 line:-2
how you should surface
the most useful information from your app


327
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,883 line:-2
and all the details about
how to bring your ideas to life.


328
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,553 line:-2
We're really excited to see
what experiences you create


329
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,022 line:-1
with the new widget system in iOS 14.
