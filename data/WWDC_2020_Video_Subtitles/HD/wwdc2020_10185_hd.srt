00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,673 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:13,413 line:0
Hi, I'm Daisy,
and I work on the Xcode Previews team.


3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,183 line:0
In this video, I want to show you
how you can use Xcode Previews


4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,085 line:0
to help you quickly build SwiftUI apps,


5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,287 line:-1
whether you're new to SwiftUI or not.


6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:23,590 line:-2
To do so, I'll be building the row view
for our smoothie app.


7
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:27,561 line:-2
The view has the smoothie's name,
ingredients, calorie count, and an image,


8
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,030 line:-2
along with the star count
for its popularity.


9
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:34,034 line:-2
To begin, I'm going to use a library
to add a new view to my UI.


10
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,537 line:-2
The library has SwiftUI views
and modifiers,


11
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,372 line:-2
allowing you
to keep your preview compiling


12
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,307 line:-1
without additional modifications.


13
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,546 line:-2
SwiftUI uses structural layouts
in order to make your app adaptive.


14
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,850 line:-2
So your app looks great whether
it's running on an iMac or an iPhone.


15
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,085 line:-2
Xcode Previews lets you insert
your content,


16
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:55,055 line:-2
and get the right layout container,
all in one action.


17
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,659 line:-2
Next, I can double-click
on my "Hello World" view,


18
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,360 line:-1
which brings focus to the editor,


19
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,430 line:-2
allowing me to quickly modify
the key component of my view,


20
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,666 line:-1
whether this is an image or text.


21
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,535 line:-2
The Xcode Previews canvas
and the source editor


22
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,137 line:-1
have a tight integration.


23
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:13,373 line:-2
The canvas and the inspector
help you write your Swift code faster,


24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,211 line:-2
and any changes you do to source
are immediately visible in the canvas.


25
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,681 line:-1
[typing]


26
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,087 line:-2
To help you build your structure
even quicker,


27
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,756 line:-2
you can use Command-D
to duplicate your views.


28
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,227 line:-2
Xcode Previews understands the structure
of your code,


29
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,596 line:-2
so if you're duplicating a view
that isn't in a container,


30
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,364 line:-1
it would insert one for you.


31
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,736 line:-2
Next, we can double-click
on our third label to quickly modify it.


32
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,806 line:-2
Double-clicking on a view not only helps
with replacing static content,


33
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:48,542 line:-2
but also makes integrating
your model data a breeze.


34
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,979 line:-1
[typing]


35
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,685 line:-2
To insert my image,
I'm going to bring up the library


36
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,188 line:-2
using the keyboard shortcut
Command-Shift-L.


37
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,459 line:-2
The Xcode Previews canvas not only works
with SwiftUI views and modifiers,


38
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:06,793 line:-1
but also your media,


39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,364 line:-2
allowing you to use your images
in your asset catalog with ease.


40
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,570 line:-1
Our image is larger than expected.


41
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,206 line:-2
This, however, makes sense,
since SwiftUI renders your images


42
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,741 line:-1
in their true size.


43
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:25,412 line:-2
To remedy this, we can use the inspector
to locate the appropriate modifier.


44
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,049 line:-2
Clicking on "Add Modifier" brings down
a list of recommended suggestions


45
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,951 line:-1
using your current context,


46
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,220 line:-2
allowing you to quickly locate
what you're looking for,


47
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,956 line:-2
and learn about modifiers
commonly used with the view.


48
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,760 line:-2
The image is now resizing,
though its size is not up to spec.


49
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,096 line:-2
In the inspector,
I can add and edit common modifiers,


50
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,698 line:-1
allowing you to try various values


51
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,167 line:-2
without having to know
the modifier's signature.


52
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,771 line:-2
This immediately updates your code
and renders in the canvas.


53
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:56,043 line:-2
Next, I want to add the star view
that indicates the smoothie's popularity.


54
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,513 line:-2
Using your project's custom SwiftUI views
and modifiers in the canvas


55
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,749 line:-2
is just as easy as using
those provided by the library.


56
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,118 line:-1
To see how to do this, see the session


57
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,188 line:-2
"Adding Custom Views and Modifiers
to the Xcode Library."


58
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:12,059 line:-2
To repeat the star horizontally,
Xcode Previews provides actions


59
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,628 line:-2
that embed the selected view
in various containers.


60
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:18,498 line:-2
The actions can be brought up by holding
Command and clicking on the view.


61
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:22,703 line:-2
In our case, we click "Embed in HStack"
to embed in a horizontal container.


62
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,771 line:-1
To repeat the star view,


63
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,574 line:-2
we can bring up the same menu
and click "Repeat."


64
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,146 line:-1
I'd like to make my smoothie title pop.


65
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,916 line:-2
Using the inspector,
I can quickly try various font


66
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,718 line:-1
and weight values on my view,


67
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,454 line:-2
and preview the results immediately
in the canvas.


68
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,991 line:-1
That doesn't look exactly how I want.


69
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,158 line:-1
To clear the modifier,


70
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,362 line:-2
I can click on the circular blue indicator
next to the control.


71
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:52,432 line:-2
Clearing the modifier returns it
to its inherited value.


72
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,602 line:-2
In this case, the font returns
to the default SwiftUI font.


73
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,606 line:-2
Next, I would like to edit
the other labels,


74
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,309 line:-2
which, with the inspectors,
is only a few clicks.


75
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:06,580 line:-2
I can use the inspectors not only
to edit properties of the modifiers,


76
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,149 line:-1
but also edit those of the view.


77
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,721 line:-1
Screen real estate is a hot commodity,


78
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,291 line:-2
so Xcode Previews has
an in-canvas inspector


79
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,928 line:-2
allowing you to close your side panel
without losing any functionality.


80
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,230 line:-1
To bring up the canvas inspector,


81
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:26,767 line:-2
hold Control-Option
and click on the view you wish to inspect.


82
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,371 line:-2
To help you preview
across different configurations,


83
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:35,742 line:-2
in Xcode 12 we have introduced various
preview-centric capabilities.


84
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,812 line:-2
For example, we can now duplicate
a preview with one click.


85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,083 line:-2
And since previews are just views,
we can inspect them too.


86
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,826 line:-2
In summary, some of the ways
Xcode Previews helps you visually edit


87
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,230 line:-2
your SwiftUI views is through
tight source editor integration,


88
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,131 line:-1
the inspector, and the library.


89
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,566 line:-1
Thanks!
