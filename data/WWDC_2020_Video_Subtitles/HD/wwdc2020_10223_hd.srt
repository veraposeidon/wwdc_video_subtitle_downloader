1
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,740 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,776 line:0
My name is Jason Cary,


3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:14,081 line:0
and today, we'll be talking about
deploying Apple devices using Zero-touch.


4
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,349 line:-1
Within this session,


5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,619 line:-2
we'll review remote deployment
and management practices


6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,488 line:-2
by looking at Apple's
internal Zero-touch deployments.


7
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,358 line:0
We'll start with setup
and infrastructure components,


8
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,860 line:0
review how we deploy devices to our users,


9
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:29,463 line:0
confirm how we identify
and secure our users


10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,098 line:0
and share how we distribute content


11
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:35,068 line:0
to ensure users are able to perform
their duties as efficiently as possible.


12
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:39,373 line:-2
Before we dive into the technical details,
let's take a second to reminisce.


13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,643 line:-2
IT admins of the past
were involved in every aspect


14
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,745 line:-1
of the hardware provisioning process.


15
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,114 line:-1
Fortunately, the days of device imaging


16
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:50,484 line:-2
and sitting with users
for hours on end are long gone.


17
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,689 line:-2
Our Zero-touch enrollment solutions
allow efficient provisioning of devices


18
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,758 line:-1
for thousands of employees worldwide.


19
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,894 line:-2
New devices are drop-shipped
from our supply chain


20
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:04,697 line:-2
directly to our users
without IT needing to touch each device.


21
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,603 line:-2
Our goal is to have our users online
and productive within minutes,


22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,239 line:-1
not hours of unboxing their new device,


23
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,943 line:-2
and to provide our users
with a positive device set up experience.


24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,046 line:-2
Let's look at the macOS Catalina
set up process


25
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,814 line:-1
for the Macs we're deploying today,


26
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,651 line:-2
which will be updated to Big Sur
after it ships later this year.


27
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,188 line:-2
As a user boots their new device
for the first time,


28
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,892 line:-2
Setup Assistant activates
and begins the device enrollment process.


29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,394 line:-1
Within our Zero-touch model,


30
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,597 line:-2
we have customized
the Setup Assistant process


31
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,198 line:-1
to be more efficient.


32
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,401 line:-2
We've removed several
Setup Assistant screens and options


33
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,971 line:-2
to provide an optimal experience
to our users.


34
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,808 line:-2
Devices are automatically enrolled
in our device management solution


35
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,243 line:-1
during the first boot,


36
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,411 line:-2
which allows us to push
critical applications


37
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,482 line:-2
and security settings to the device
during the initial set up process.


38
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,353 line:-2
One of the most important set up steps
is to have the user


39
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,155 line:-2
create a local user account
and a secure password.


40
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:06,693 line:-2
This is where a specific account name
and password restrictions can be enforced.


41
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,729 line:-2
I'll talk about several of these settings
later on.


42
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,633 line:-2
Users self-configure various settings
to their preference,


43
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,235 line:-2
including light and dark mode
within mac OS.


44
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,306 line:-2
At the conclusion
of the device enrollment process,


45
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,376 line:-2
Setup Assistant completes
the remaining device set up tasks


46
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,745 line:-2
and brings the user
to their desktop screen.


47
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,448 line:-2
When the user arrives
at their desktop screen,


48
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,851 line:-2
applications required
to complete their duties,


49
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:32,786 line:-1
as well as critical security settings,


50
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,289 line:-2
are already installed
and enabled on the device.


51
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,027 line:-2
Through the use of Apple Business Manager
and our device management solution,


52
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:46,466 line:-2
our team has achieved an astounding ratio
of 20,000 managed devices per MDM admin.


53
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,871 line:-2
Recently, in response
to the ongoing health pandemic,


54
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,606 line:-1
Apple sent many of our employees home


55
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,708 line:-2
from their normal
brick-and-mortar locations


56
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,677 line:-1
to perform their job functions remotely.


57
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,814 line:-2
As a result of this quick decision
and the prompt actions that were taken,


58
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:05,152 line:-2
many of our employees were unable to take
their primary workstations with them.


59
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,055 line:-2
Apple drop-shipped each
of these particular employees


60
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,458 line:-2
a new Mac device to their home
in a very short time frame.


61
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,228 line:-2
Our users were able to power on
their new devices


62
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,965 line:-2
and quickly become productive,
thanks to Zero-touch device management.


63
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:19,666 line:-1
Without these capabilities,


64
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,768 line:-2
the quick pivot
would not have been possible,


65
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:25,672 line:-2
and affected employees would have been
idle for an extended amount of time,


66
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,843 line:-2
impacting their work and Apple's ability
to continue to support our customers.


67
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,981 line:-2
Let's dive into our Zero-touch environment
setup and infrastructure components.


68
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,317 line:-1
So, how does this technology work?


69
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:41,288 line:-2
Our remote management solution is
made possible by Apple Business Manager,


70
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,623 line:-1
the device management framework


71
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,225 line:-2
with a third-party
device management solution,


72
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,632 line:-2
and core technologies in iOS
iPadOS, macOS and tvOS,


73
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,901 line:-2
that enable management
of certain features.


74
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,638 line:-2
Starting with the purchase,
the device details are sent


75
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,874 line:-2
to Apple Business Manager
through Apple's reseller API.


76
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,913 line:-2
Each Apple Business Manager account
is configured with a default MDM target,


77
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:10,150 line:-2
which allows the device to be assigned
to an organization's preferred MDM server.


78
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,520 line:-2
Devices are purchased
through the reseller channel.


79
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,457 line:-2
Each reseller partners with Apple
to obtain access to our reseller API.


80
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:23,063 line:-2
Upon a device being purchased,
the reseller API performs data validation


81
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,466 line:-2
to ensure sales notification data
is accurate and unique.


82
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,605 line:-2
Multiple device details are included
in the reseller API transaction,


83
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,708 line:-2
including serial number,
purchase order details,


84
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,777 line:-1
date of purchase and more.


85
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,648 line:-2
Checks can also be performed to validate
the device is not currently enrolled


86
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,851 line:-2
with another
Apple Business Manager account.


87
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,587 line:-1
Once verified, the device purchase record


88
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,022 line:-2
is transferred
into Apple Business Manager.


89
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,160 line:-2
Pending receipt of the sales transaction
into Apple Business Manager,


90
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:56,463 line:-2
the device is added to a specific
Apple Business Manager account


91
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,332 line:-1
based on the reseller ID provided.


92
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,302 line:-2
A device is associated
with its intended MDM server


93
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,639 line:-2
based upon the previously mentioned
Apple Business Manager assignment.


94
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,943 line:-2
Multiple MDM targets can be configured
for a single organization.


95
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,380 line:-2
Communication between the MDM server
and the device


96
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:17,818 line:-2
is established during
the device set up process using APNs,


97
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:21,588 line:-2
including the device receiving its initial
configuration instructions.


98
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:26,026 line:-2
The MDM is then able to apply
pre-stage profiles to the device.


99
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,163 line:-2
Devices may be manually assigned
to an MDM service


100
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,333 line:-2
which is not the default MDM target
for your organization.


101
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,671 line:-2
Such assignments should be completed prior
to the user receiving their device.


102
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:42,943 line:-1
As of macOS 10.15.4 and iOS 13.4,


103
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,114 line:-2
APNs also now supports
proxy configurations.


104
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,917 line:-2
Apple is making it easier
for organizations


105
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,786 line:-2
to communicate with
the Apple Push Notification service


106
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,254 line:-1
on proxy networks.


107
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:58,258 line:-2
APNs allows communication
from MDM to your devices.


108
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:03,330 line:-2
Organizations need to allow communication
from their network to APNs.


109
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:08,402 line:-2
Apple Push Notification service traffic
will now use a web proxy


110
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:13,707 line:-2
when it is specified in
a Proxy Auto-Configuration, or PAC, file.


111
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,311 line:-2
This new feature will provide
improved support


112
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,114 line:-2
for default-deny networks,
typical in regulated industries,


113
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,318 line:-2
as all Internet-bound traffic
must traverse a proxy


114
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,353 line:-1
that is configured by a PAC file.


115
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:30,490 line:-2
APNs traffic is encrypted
and cannot be inspected.


116
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:35,462 line:-2
APNs proxy support will provide
full MDM functionality


117
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,197 line:-1
on proxy-enabled networks.


118
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:42,302 line:-2
Work with your network teams
for how your devices discover the PAC URL:


119
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,205 line:-2
automatically
or via a configuration profile.


120
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,110 line:-2
Data traffic traversing APNs
cannot be inspected,


121
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:54,081 line:-2
so the communications remain secure
without the threat of being intercepted.


122
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:59,786 line:-2
Let's look at an example of an MDM profile
in macOS Catalina.


123
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,122 line:-2
Apple's management approach
has always been


124
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,057 line:-1
to make it really simple for businesses


125
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,327 line:-2
to centrally manage
their Apple devices with MDM.


126
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:12,366 line:-2
The process is fully secure, streamlined
and easy for the user.


127
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,867 line:-1
And it is transparent,


128
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,171 line:-2
so that users know everything
that happens to their device,


129
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,741 line:-2
including how it's set up
and what has been deployed to it.


130
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:24,745 line:-2
In this way, users are a part of
the process and have a role to play,


131
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,115 line:-2
whether each device is enrolled
in Apple Business Manager or not.


132
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,184 line:-1
So what can MDM do?


133
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,885 line:-1
Here are just a few examples.


134
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,389 line:-2
Through the use of configuration profiles,
you can enforce passcodes,


135
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,425 line:0
restrict various settings
or organize apps in the Dock.


136
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,962 line:-2
You can also configure macOS devices
to automatically connect


137
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,031 line:-1
to an enterprise Wi-Fi network,


138
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,934 line:0
set up e-mail accounts,
install applications,


139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,869 line:-1
and enforce encryption with FileVault.


140
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,272 line:-2
The last step in deploying macOS
and a Zero-touch solution


141
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,041 line:-1
is getting your infrastructure ready.


142
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,444 line:-2
macOS supports a wide range
of standard technologies


143
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,581 line:-2
for everything from networking
to accounts and identities.


144
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,318 line:-2
Most of these are the same standards
that companies already support


145
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,519 line:-1
for iOS devices.


146
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:09,990 line:-2
As a result, IT teams only need
to configure a few additional things


147
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:13,026 line:-2
to do basic integration
and support key infrastructure.


148
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,796 line:-1
There will be additional considerations


149
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,432 line:-2
as you build your own
remote management environment.


150
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:22,936 line:-2
Infrastructure components may vary
based on your organization's needs.


151
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,639 line:-2
The first significant decision
that needs to be made


152
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,742 line:-2
is whether the environment will be
on-premise or cloud-based.


153
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,545 line:-1
Utilizing multiple MDM environments


154
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:35,448 line:-2
allows MDM administrators
to push and test new settings


155
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,751 line:-2
without the risk of impact
to production users and devices.


156
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,789 line:-2
A good multiple environment setup
includes Production,


157
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,959 line:-2
Disaster Recovery
in a geographically separate location


158
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,694 line:-1
from your production environment,


159
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,329 line:-1
Test and Development.


160
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,164 line:-1
For on-premise environments,


161
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,601 line:-2
containers or virtual machines
can be used for low processing needs


162
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,837 line:-2
such as web servers
and application servers.


163
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,674 line:-2
High computing needs
such as database transactions


164
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:04,745 line:-2
should be properly sized to ensure
efficient processing of such requests.


165
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,114 line:-2
The use of bare metal servers
may be beneficial


166
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,283 line:-1
for resource-intensive functions.


167
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,520 line:-2
You should install and enable
firewalls and access control list


168
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,189 line:-1
at each layer of your solution.


169
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,793 line:-2
Load balancers may be beneficial
for larger organizations


170
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,496 line:-2
to balance management traffic
from your users.


171
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:26,633 line:-2
However, they may not be necessary for
smaller implementations and organizations.


172
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,503 line:-1
Let's talk now about deployment.


173
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:35,008 line:-2
Our Zero-touch solution allows devices
to be drop-shipped from the supply chain


174
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,276 line:-1
directly to our users.


175
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,781 line:-2
Remember, your organization might choose
to skip certain aspects


176
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,850 line:-1
of the normal Setup Assistant process


177
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,219 line:-1
to streamline the device set up process.


178
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,555 line:-2
Each device
is automatically enrolled into MDM


179
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,725 line:-2
upon Setup Assistant running
during the first boot.


180
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:55,128 line:-2
Users receive a custom
MDM enrollment notification screen


181
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:58,031 line:-2
during Setup Assistant
which confirms their enrollment.


182
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:03,804 line:-2
In our case, a self-service application
is automatically installed on the device.


183
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,339 line:-1
Commonly used applications,


184
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:09,276 line:-2
including a single sign-on,
or SSO, authentication client


185
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:12,846 line:-2
are automatically pushed to each device
upon MDM enrollment.


186
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,518 line:-2
Additional applications
such as corporate and contact center tools


187
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,920 line:-1
are also made available to the user


188
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,856 line:-2
via a self-service portal
to install at their convenience.


189
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,994 line:-2
You should intentionally decide
which apps are automatically pushed


190
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,264 line:-2
and which you allow the user
to install for themselves.


191
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,700 line:-2
Some apps may be best
pushed automatically, but not all.


192
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,337 line:-2
Local admin rights
are provisioned for our users.


193
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,908 line:-2
User experience is greatly enhanced
and fewer issues occur


194
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,844 line:-2
when users are provided
local admin rights to their device.


195
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,849 line:-2
Measures should be taken
to ensure devices are properly secured


196
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,884 line:-1
based on your organization's needs.


197
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,754 line:-1
There are many different types of payloads


198
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,091 line:-2
that can be built and deployed
to managed devices using an MDM solution.


199
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,094 line:-2
All these different payloads
allow different settings in macOS


200
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,930 line:-1
to be set by administrators


201
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,131 line:-1
and are fully customizable


202
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,700 line:-2
to your organization's business
and security needs.


203
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,104 line:-2
Apple pushes a number of payloads
to our users' devices


204
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,207 line:-1
via our internal MDM solution.


205
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,776 line:-2
Corporate and business
critical applications


206
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,645 line:-2
are automatically installed
upon MDM enrollment.


207
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,515 line:-2
Mail and Calendar settings
are also auto-configured


208
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:24,651 line:-2
upon the user logging in
to our single sign-on application.


209
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:29,256 line:-2
Additionally,
VPN and our internal wireless network


210
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:31,658 line:-2
are also configured automatically
for our users,


211
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,361 line:-2
allowing them to go online
and become productive


212
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,330 line:-1
immediately after MDM enrollment.


213
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,667 line:-2
Identifying all users
connecting to Apple's network


214
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,337 line:-2
and using Apple tools
is extremely important.


215
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,673 line:-2
Numerous security measures
and settings are used


216
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,177 line:-2
to identify users
and secure their devices from compromises.


217
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,547 line:-2
User information is pulled
by our MDM solution


218
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:55,649 line:-1
through the SSO authentication client.


219
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,586 line:-2
Functionality will depend
on the identity provider being used,


220
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:03,156 line:-2
but most LDAP integrations will support
these identification functions.


221
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:08,262 line:-2
We have the ability to scope
MDM profiles, policies,


222
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,765 line:-2
applications, and settings
based on LDAP groups and user roles.


223
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,270 line:-2
You may use one
of a number of identity providers


224
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,805 line:-2
and your full identity solution
can take advantage


225
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,242 line:-2
of many of the built-in
user identification functions


226
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,912 line:-1
depending on availability within your MDM.


227
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,516 line:-2
Where such functionality does not exist
within your MDM,


228
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:33,387 line:-2
custom scripts can be used to perform
additional identification functions.


229
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,824 line:0
For more on enterprise identity
and authentication,


230
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,893 line:0
please see this year's identity session.


231
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,864 line:-2
We have implemented numerous
industry best practice security settings,


232
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,266 line:-2
as well as settings specific
to our own needs


233
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,168 line:-1
and internal security requirements.


234
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,405 line:-2
These settings ensure our users,
their devices,


235
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,974 line:-2
and the data they access
remain safe and secure.


236
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,046 line:-2
Settings in gray
are common baseline security settings.


237
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,482 line:-2
Some or all of the listed settings
may be beneficial to organizations


238
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,751 line:-1
setting up their own Zero-touch solution.


239
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,422 line:-2
Settings listed in white
are specific settings


240
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,225 line:-2
put in place by Apple
to further protect our users,


241
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,760 line:-2
their devices,
and their data being accessed.


242
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:18,665 line:-2
As we utilize very sensitive customer data
to support our customers,


243
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,602 line:-2
additional settings are needed
to ensure that data remains safe.


244
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,740 line:-2
If a device is found to be out of policy,
lost, or stolen,


245
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,775 line:-1
or if an employee leaves the company,


246
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,777 line:-1
an MDM server can take action


247
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,680 line:-2
to protect corporate information
in a number of ways.


248
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:37,017 line:-2
A device must have a network connection
to receive these commands.


249
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:42,089 line:-2
An IT administrator can end
the MDM relationship with a device


250
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,793 line:-2
by removing the configuration profile
that contains the MDM server information,


251
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,031 line:-2
including the accounts and settings
the MDM was responsible for installing.


252
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:56,170 line:-2
IT can also keep
the MDM configuration profile in place


253
00:13:56,236 --> 00:14:00,107 line:-2
and use MDM to remove
only the specific configuration profiles


254
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,243 line:-2
and provisioning profiles
they want to delete.


255
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,913 line:-2
This approach keeps
the device managed by MDM


256
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:09,383 line:-2
and eliminates the need to re-enroll
once it is back within policy.


257
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:14,388 line:-2
Both methods give IT
the ability to ensure that information


258
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,624 line:-2
is only available
to compliant users and devices,


259
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,026 line:-1
and that corporate data is removed


260
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,628 line:-2
without interfering
with a user's personal data


261
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,865 line:-1
such as music, photos, or personal apps.


262
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,669 line:-2
To permanently delete
all media and data on a device,


263
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,071 line:-1
MDM can remotely wipe a Mac.


264
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,873 line:-1
If a user has lost their device,


265
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,143 line:-2
IT can also choose to send
a remote lock command to the device.


266
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,545 line:-1
This process locks the device


267
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,315 line:-2
and requires a password
created by the administrator


268
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,984 line:-1
to unlock and resume use of the device.


269
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:47,154 line:-2
Providing our users
with the necessary applications


270
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:48,388 line:-1
to perform their duties


271
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:51,358 line:-2
is essential to the success
of our business operations.


272
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,294 line:-1
Device-based app management


273
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:57,364 line:-2
allows us to distribute apps
directly to our users' devices


274
00:14:57,431 --> 00:15:00,200 line:-1
with Apple Business Manager and MDM.


275
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:03,036 line:-2
And the process
to get devices up and running is easy,


276
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,739 line:-2
whether they're assigned
to a specific user or not.


277
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,142 line:-1
We use VPP and MDM


278
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,979 line:-2
to assign and distribute apps
directly to a device


279
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,481 line:-1
instead of requiring the user’s Apple ID.


280
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,018 line:-2
This includes installing apps
on MacOS devices


281
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:22,189 line:-2
without first configuring an Apple ID
or sending an invitation to a user.


282
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:26,026 line:-2
If your organization
has a large number of devices,


283
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,596 line:-2
you may benefit from
enabling MacOS content caching


284
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,598 line:-1
which locally caches apps,


285
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:34,468 line:-2
operating system updates,
and other content from Apple.


286
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,706 line:-2
Several new features
are forthcoming in macOS Big Sur,


287
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,442 line:-2
which will further enhance
app distribution.


288
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,312 line:-2
One of the key new features
is managed apps.


289
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:48,916 line:-2
Managed apps will empower users
to install their previously used apps


290
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,384 line:-1
via their Apple ID.


291
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,854 line:-1
Managed apps will also provide IT admins


292
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:56,523 line:-2
with the ability
to lock important applications


293
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,060 line:-2
to prevent those apps from being removed
or used maliciously.


294
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,831 line:0
For additional details
on new features within macOS Big Sur,


295
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,366 line:0
please see these related sessions


296
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,802 line:0
and the previously mentioned
identity session.


297
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,104 line:-1
Let's review.


298
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:15,475 line:-2
Zero-touch enrollment is a real thing
and will make your life much easier.


299
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,146 line:-2
User experiences
are significantly improved


300
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,815 line:-2
through user-friendly approaches
to common problems.


301
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:26,053 line:-2
Hardware deployment can be
a hands-off, efficient process


302
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,955 line:-1
for users and admins alike.


303
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,658 line:-2
The sky is the limit
with security settings.


304
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,827 line:-2
They can be customized
based on business needs,


305
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:36,864 line:-1
user roles, DS groups, and other criteria.


306
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,902 line:-2
There is no one-size-fits-all approach
to device management.


307
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,805 line:-2
Use what works best for your organization
and your goals.


308
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,443 line:-2
Start small and expand
your device management solutions


309
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,578 line:-1
and complexity over time.


310
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,150 line:-2
Zero-touch enrollment allows
efficient provisioning of devices to users


311
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:01,221 line:-2
without the need for IT
to touch or configure each device.


312
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:06,627 line:-2
And finally, the ability to unbox and go
provides a great user experience.


313
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,463 line:-2
Thank you very much
for attending this session.


314
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,200 line:-2
I hope you enjoy
the rest of your WWDC 2020 experience.
