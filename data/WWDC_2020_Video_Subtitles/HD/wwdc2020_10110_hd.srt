00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:06,974 position:25% line:-1
Hello, and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:12,613 position:25% line:0
Hi, I'm Tommy Pauly, and I'll be sharing
some important privacy updates


3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,782 position:25% line:0
about how your apps
interact with local networks.


4
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,820 position:25% line:-2
A network isn't just a way
to connect to the internet.


5
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:24,925 position:25% line:-2
Your iPhone is often interacting directly
with other devices on its local network.


6
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,762 position:25% line:-2
You may be controlling the lights
at your house,


7
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,833 position:25% line:-2
printing a document at work,
watching a video on an airplane,


8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,035 position:25% line:-1
or playing a game with a friend nearby.


9
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:40,674 position:25% line:-2
If your app provides an experience
like this, it uses the local network.


10
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:45,479 position:25% line:-2
On Apple devices, the best way
to use the local network is with Bonjour.


11
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:52,219 position:25% line:-2
Bonjour lets your app discover nearby
services, and advertise its own services.


12
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:56,390 position:25% line:-2
Bonjour is the foundation
for streaming video and audio,


13
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:00,561 position:25% line:-2
playing peer-to-peer games,
and communicating with printers,


14
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,496 position:25% line:-1
cameras and home devices.


15
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,900 position:25% line:-2
Some apps also interact
with the local network at a lower level.


16
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,903 position:25% line:-1
Your app may configure a Wi-Fi router,


17
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,540 position:25% line:-2
or use a custom multicast
or broadcast protocol


18
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,509 position:25% line:-1
to communicate with legacy hardware.


19
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:20,981 position:25% line:-2
For your app, accessing the local network
is a powerful tool.


20
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:25,085 position:25% line:-2
And with this great power
comes an equally great responsibility.


21
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,120 position:25% line:-1
Respecting user privacy.


22
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,558 position:25% line:-2
Users should know
when your app accesses the local network.


23
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:35,662 position:25% line:-2
And you as a developer
should also be aware when the frameworks


24
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,998 position:25% line:-1
used by your app do the same.


25
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,836 position:25% line:-2
Let's explore how privacy intersects
with network access.


26
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,474 position:25% line:-2
Location is one of the most
privacy-sensitive pieces of information


27
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,309 position:25% line:-1
that your app can access.


28
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,578 position:25% line:-1
Starting in iOS 13,


29
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:56,884 position:25% line:-2
your app needs Location permission
to read a network's name and BSSID.


30
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:02,155 position:25% line:-2
But simply accessing the local network
can also provide a location hint.


31
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,527 position:25% line:0
For example,
when someone is on their home network,


32
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:10,197 position:25% line:0
the set of devices
and services around them is unique.


33
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,767 position:25% line:-2
No two home networks
look exactly the same.


34
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,604 position:25% line:-2
And this information
about devices on a network


35
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,808 position:25% line:-2
can be used by apps
to create a location fingerprint.


36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,780 position:25% line:-2
Your app also needs permission
to control devices around you.


37
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:31,919 position:25% line:-2
Communicating over Bluetooth allows
your app to access sensitive information.


38
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,056 position:25% line:-2
But accessing the local network
can reveal a lot of similar information.


39
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:42,396 position:25% line:-2
For example, many devices can be set up
and managed by an app over local Wi-Fi.


40
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:48,335 position:25% line:-2
However, any other app can also
try to communicate with that device.


41
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:53,507 position:25% line:-2
If your app manages a camera,
it should have access to sync photos,


42
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,943 position:25% line:-1
but other apps probably shouldn't.


43
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:03,383 position:25% line:-2
And that's why, in iOS 14, users can now
control which apps are allowed to access


44
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,586 position:25% line:-1
and interact with the local network.


45
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:11,124 position:25% line:-2
This is a great opportunity to provide
more transparency to your users,


46
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:16,230 position:25% line:-2
and review the ways in which the code
running in your app accesses the network.


47
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:20,501 position:25% line:-2
If your app just accesses resources
on the wide internet,


48
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,369 position:25% line:-1
you don't need to do anything different.


49
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,240 position:25% line:-2
You also don't need to update
if you only interact


50
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,842 position:25% line:-2
with the local network
using a system service,


51
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,579 position:25% line:-2
like AirPrint, AirPlay, AirDrop,
or HomeKit.


52
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,650 position:25% line:-2
These system services
handle device discovery


53
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,320 position:25% line:-2
without exposing the full list
of devices to apps.


54
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,588 position:25% line:-1
On the other hand,


55
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,425 position:25% line:-2
if your app accesses the local network
directly within your app,


56
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:48,862 position:25% line:-2
either with unicast
or multicast protocols,


57
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,064 position:25% line:-1
your app will require permission.


58
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:56,136 position:25% line:-2
You'll also need to make a few
simple updates to your app for iOS 14.


59
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,305 position:25% line:-1
To get into the details,


60
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:02,509 position:25% line:-2
let's look at how your app gets permission
to access the local network,


61
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,547 position:25% line:-1
how you update your app for iOS 14,


62
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,616 position:25% line:-1
and how to ensure a great experience


63
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,352 position:25% line:-1
when people use your app's features.


64
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,855 position:25% line:-1
Let's start by looking at permissions.


65
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,624 position:25% line:-1
Apps now trigger a prompt


66
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,560 position:25% line:-2
the first time they try to interact
with the local network.


67
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,497 position:25% line:-1
Until permission is granted,


68
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,266 position:25% line:-2
all local network communication
is blocked.


69
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,504 position:25% line:-1
The prompt includes a usage description


70
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,707 position:25% line:-1
that you specify in your app's Info.plist.


71
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:38,879 position:25% line:-2
Apps that haven't updated to iOS 14
will show default reason text.


72
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,883 position:25% line:-2
If you notice a prompt
that you don't expect for your app,


73
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:47,421 position:25% line:-2
you might be using a third-party framework
that accesses the local network.


74
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:51,725 position:25% line:-2
Remember, any permission
that is granted to your app


75
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,995 position:25% line:-1
also applies to the frameworks you use.


76
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:01,168 position:25% line:-2
The permission for your app
can be checked and modified at any time


77
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,438 position:25% line:-2
in the Privacy panel of Settings
under Local Network.


78
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:09,409 position:25% line:-2
Every app that has requested access
to the local network shows up here.


79
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:14,414 position:25% line:-2
The toggle will also show up
in the settings for your specific app.


80
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:19,620 position:25% line:-2
Once your app updates to iOS 14,
there are a few modifications


81
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:23,624 position:25% line:-2
you need to make to ensure it works
with the privacy permissions.


82
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,995 position:25% line:-2
There are two new keys you can provide
in your app's Info.plist.


83
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:33,166 position:25% line:-2
First, if your app ever accesses
the local network,


84
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,736 position:25% line:-1
you should provide a usage description.


85
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:41,341 position:25% line:-2
This explains which features
in your app require the local network.


86
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:46,313 position:25% line:-2
And second, if your app uses Bonjour
to browse or advertise,


87
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,284 position:25% line:-2
you must provide
a list of the service types that you use.


88
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:55,255 position:25% line:0
Each service type is a unique string
registered with IANA,


89
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,658 position:25% line:0
that identifies your application protocol.


90
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:02,129 position:25% line:0
Here, the service type is tictactoe.tcp.


91
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:07,000 position:25% line:-2
There are several different APIs
that allow your app to use Bonjour.


92
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,671 position:25% line:-1
If you use any of these APIs,


93
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:16,910 position:25% line:-2
be sure to update your Info.plist
to list out your Bonjour service types.


94
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:22,282 position:25% line:-2
There's a small set of apps that perform
their local multicast discovery


95
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,917 position:25% line:-1
without Bonjour,


96
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:28,055 position:25% line:-2
or that need to enumerate all
of the Bonjour service types on a network.


97
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:32,826 position:25% line:-2
These operations
require an entitlement in iOS 14.


98
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:37,030 position:25% line:-2
You can request this entitlement
through the developer portal.


99
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,734 position:25% line:-2
Now let's walk through the process
of updating your app.


100
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,873 position:25% line:-2
So here's an app
that I originally built for iOS 13,


101
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,076 position:25% line:-2
that lets me play tic-tac-toe
with others around me.


102
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,214 position:25% line:-2
All I'm going to do is rerun the app
against the iOS 14 SDK


103
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,516 position:25% line:-1
and see what happens.


104
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,290 position:25% line:-1
All right. So I don't see anyone nearby.


105
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:08,962 position:25% line:-2
And that's kind of unexpected to me.
It's not working as I really wanted.


106
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,164 position:25% line:-1
And if I look at the debug output,


107
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:17,204 position:25% line:-2
you can notice that there is an error
that we're getting from our browser object


108
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,639 position:25% line:-1
of "NoAuth."


109
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:23,110 position:25% line:-2
This error means
that the app is being blocked


110
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,979 position:25% line:-1
without any local network access prompt.


111
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:31,652 position:25% line:-2
If you see this NoAuth error, it means
that you need to add your Bonjour services


112
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,955 position:25% line:-1
and usage description to your Info.plist.


113
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,157 position:25% line:-1
Let's go do that now.


114
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:43,063 position:25% line:-2
So what we do is, we go to
the project settings, and we look at Info.


115
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:46,099 position:25% line:-2
Here, we're gonna need to add
two new fields.


116
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,837 position:25% line:-1
First is the privacy field


117
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,840 position:25% line:-2
for the local network access
usage description.


118
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,144 position:25% line:-1
Great.


119
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,446 position:25% line:-1
So here let's put something like,


120
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,950 position:25% line:-1
"TicTacToe uses the local network


121
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:07,054 position:25% line:-1
to discover players around you."


122
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,590 position:25% line:-1
That makes sense.


123
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,227 position:25% line:-2
And the other thing we need to do
is add the Bonjour service types.


124
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:18,532 position:25% line:-1
So this can be added as Bonjour services.


125
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,002 position:25% line:-2
And automatically this knows
that it's an array of strings.


126
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:29,877 position:25% line:-2
This app only uses one type,
and that type is tictactoe.tcp.


127
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:34,648 position:25% line:-2
Great. Let's recompile the app now
and see what happens.


128
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,390 position:25% line:-1
All right.


129
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:47,561 position:25% line:-2
So we see that immediately
we get a prompt in the app


130
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:51,532 position:25% line:-2
that TicTacToe would like to find and
connect to devices on my local network.


131
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:56,470 position:25% line:-2
And we also see that custom usage string
that we set in the Info.plist.


132
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:01,041 position:25% line:-2
Now, if I click "Ok,"
the app is actually browsing on Bonjour.


133
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,109 position:25% line:-1
That's great.


134
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:06,313 position:25% line:-2
However, you might have noticed that this
happened right when I launched the app,


135
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,383 position:25% line:-2
and that can be a bit of
a jarring experience for the user.


136
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:14,321 position:25% line:-2
Instead, I have also created
another version of the app


137
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,057 position:25% line:-2
that only prompts,
and only tries to browse,


138
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,626 position:25% line:-1
when the user actually does an action.


139
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,995 position:25% line:-2
So let's go over to the phone
and look at that now.


140
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,199 position:25% line:-1
So here is this other version of the app.


141
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,802 position:25% line:-2
And you notice that once I started
running it, there wasn't a prompt.


142
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,973 position:25% line:-2
Instead, only when I start clicking on
"Search for games"


143
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,210 position:25% line:-2
to initiate the discovery
of other players,


144
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,845 position:25% line:-1
do I get the prompt.


145
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,381 position:25% line:-2
This experience is much better,
and let's allow that.


146
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,786 position:25% line:-1
As you just saw,


147
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:49,189 position:25% line:-2
gating local network access
with a privacy permission


148
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,758 position:25% line:-2
might change the experience
of using your app.


149
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,429 position:25% line:-2
I want to highlight
a couple of best practices to consider


150
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,797 position:25% line:-1
when updating your app.


151
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:03,303 position:25% line:-2
First, make sure that people aren't
confused when your app triggers a prompt.


152
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,774 position:25% line:-2
Rather than trying to browse the network
when your app launches,


153
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,410 position:25% line:-1
wait for an action that requires browsing.


154
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:15,015 position:25% line:-2
This is your app's opportunity
to be granted access to the local network.


155
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:18,285 position:25% line:-2
Choosing the right moment
makes it more likely


156
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,320 position:25% line:-1
that someone will allow access.


157
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,491 position:25% line:-1
When your app does trigger a prompt,


158
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:28,161 position:25% line:-2
make sure you've provided
a clear usage description


159
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,765 position:25% line:-2
that indicates exactly
what feature is being enabled.


160
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:35,469 position:25% line:-2
Your app may also encounter errors
and API behaviors


161
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,437 position:25% line:-1
that it hadn't handled previously.


162
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:42,109 position:25% line:-2
Bonjour APIs deliver results
asynchronously.


163
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,579 position:25% line:-2
Whenever your app
is waiting for permission,


164
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,282 position:25% line:-2
it will simply look like
there are no devices nearby.


165
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,486 position:25% line:-1
Local connections that use NWConnection


166
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:56,323 position:25% line:-2
will stay in the waiting state
until your app gets permission.


167
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:02,262 position:25% line:-2
Similarly, if your URLSession tasks
use the local network,


168
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,699 position:25% line:-2
make sure to set
the waitsForConnectivity property,


169
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:09,303 position:25% line:-2
so your task will complete
once permission is granted.


170
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,607 position:25% line:-2
And if you're still using
sockets directly,


171
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:18,779 position:25% line:-2
you will need to handle system call errors
when your app doesn't have permission.


172
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:24,218 position:25% line:-2
Lastly, your app should prefer
using system-provided experiences


173
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,320 position:25% line:-1
for local networking whenever possible.


174
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:32,326 position:25% line:-2
If you use AirPrint, AirPlay,
AirDrop, or HomeKit,


175
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,262 position:25% line:-2
your app doesn’t
need to handle anything special,


176
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:38,799 position:25% line:-2
while still providing
strong privacy guarantees.


177
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,369 position:25% line:-2
Let’s recap what you need to do
in your app.


178
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:47,140 position:25% line:-2
First, rebuild your app
with the iOS 14 SDK


179
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,544 position:25% line:-2
and test out the ways that your app
uses the local network.


180
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:56,350 position:25% line:-2
Second, make sure to provide a clear
usage description in your Info.plist


181
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,886 position:25% line:-1
if your app does use the local network.


182
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,889 position:25% line:-1
And last, if your app uses Bonjour,


183
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:05,158 position:25% line:-2
declare your service types
in your Info.plist.


184
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,761 position:25% line:-1
Thanks for watching.
