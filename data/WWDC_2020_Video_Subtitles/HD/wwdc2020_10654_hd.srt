1
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:06,440 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,444 line:0
Hi, everyone, and welcome to WWDC.


3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,947 line:0
My name is Lizzy, and I'm excited to talk
about how to create awesome content


4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,849 line:0
for Swift Playgrounds on iPad and Mac.


5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:19,486 line:-2
We all know Swift Playgrounds as
the app that brought Swift coding to iPad.


6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:24,057 line:-2
And now, built with Mac Catalyst,
the same app is available on Mac too.


7
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,026 line:-1
Your users will get the same experience


8
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,095 line:-2
they've come to know and love
on their iPads,


9
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,963 line:-1
now customized for the Mac platform.


10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,031 line:-1
In this session,


11
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:34,134 line:-2
we'd like to share some of the ways
that you can customize your content


12
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,803 line:-2
so it's a great experience
on both platforms.


13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,707 line:-2
After that, we'll show a demo of a book
that behaves differently on Mac and iPad.


14
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:44,611 line:-2
First, let's discuss some updates
in the Swift Playgrounds user interface.


15
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,581 line:-2
There are a few key parts
of the Swift Playgrounds app


16
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,284 line:-2
that have been adapted
to better fit the Mac platform.


17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,286 line:-1
One of these areas is code completion.


18
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,723 line:-2
On iPad, you'll recognize this
as the area where you can browse


19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,193 line:-2
code completion options
for your current state.


20
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,431 line:-2
On Mac, there's a new,
expandable area for code completion


21
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,733 line:-2
that can include quick help
for each token.


22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,468 line:-1
These descriptions can be localized,


23
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,604 line:-2
which creates a better code completion
experience


24
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:12,306 line:-1
for users in different languages.


25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,441 line:-1
To add quick help to your token,


26
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,511 line:-2
use three forward slashes directly
above your declaration.


27
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,214 line:-2
You can also add descriptions
to parameters.


28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,217 line:-2
Here, we added a description
to the changeTurtleEyes function.


29
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,621 line:-2
You'll see this turtle again later on in
our demo, and in the Swan's Quest series.


30
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:33,293 line:-2
This text will now appear below your token
in the expanded code completion view.


31
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,030 line:-1
Even if your users won't be on a Mac,


32
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,933 line:-2
these descriptions
will still be displayed on iPad as well


33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,302 line:-2
in the "quick help" popover
in the source editor


34
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,638 line:-1
and over the original code completion bar.


35
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,076 line:-2
Next, let's talk about how your content
can be adapted to each platform.


36
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,779 line:-2
There are two new optional keys
in the PlaygroundBookDocumentFormat:


37
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,582 line:-1
supportedDevices and requiredCapabilities.


38
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,453 line:-2
You can use these keys to specify what
your book requires from the device to run.


39
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:03,223 line:-2
If the current device doesn't support
a book, it won't show up in the feed.


40
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,760 line:-2
To specify that your document only runs
on Mac or iPad,


41
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,961 line:-1
you can use the supportedDevices key.


42
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,633 line:-2
The valid values for this
are "iPad" and "Mac."


43
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,169 line:-2
You'll need to add this key
to the book level manifest,


44
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,337 line:-1
and to the feed.json file.


45
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,940 line:-2
For example,
if your book supports both platforms,


46
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,942 line:-1
you'll want to add "iPad" and "Mac"


47
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,945 line:-2
to the supportedDevices key
in the book level manifest.


48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,082 line:-2
Then, add the same values
to the supportedDevices key


49
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,084 line:-1
in the feed.json file as well.


50
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,821 line:-2
This book is now available
on both platforms.


51
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,959 line:-2
If "Mac" is removed
from the supportedDevices keys,


52
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,295 line:-2
then it will no longer be available
on that platform.


53
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,864 line:-2
Instead of only supporting
a particular device,


54
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,866 line:-1
we can require specific capabilities,


55
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,335 line:-2
which can make your content available
to more users.


56
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,804 line:-2
The values for the
requiredCapabilities key


57
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:54,141 line:-2
can be anything from the
UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities keys


58
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,543 line:-2
available to look at
on developer.apple.com.


59
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,880 line:-2
This includes things like ARKit,
microphone and Wi-Fi,


60
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:02,182 line:-2
which you can use
to specify what your book requires.


61
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,118 line:-2
To use this key,
add "requiredCapabilities"


62
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,522 line:-2
and an array of each capability
to the book level manifest.


63
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,258 line:-1
Then add "requiredCapabilities"


64
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,261 line:-2
and the same array
to the feed.json file as well.


65
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:17,531 line:-2
In this example, the book requires use
of the microphone and ARKit.


66
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,201 line:-2
In general, it's best to support
as many configurations as possible,


67
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,904 line:-2
even if some functionality is different
between platforms.


68
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,875 line:-2
To do this, we can determine if
the playground is being compiled for Mac


69
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,210 line:-2
or for iPad
by checking the target environment.


70
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,913 line:-2
It's a good idea
to go through the language in your book


71
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,315 line:-2
to make sure it makes sense
for both platforms.


72
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,085 line:-2
Some things to look out for
are uses of "click" or "touch."


73
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,389 line:-2
Generic language, like "tap" or "select,"
is recommended instead.


74
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:46,193 line:-2
Next, let's talk about how content
can conform to device settings.


75
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,364 line:-2
When building content, it's important
to respect the device system settings,


76
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,866 line:-1
such as accent color and Dark Mode.


77
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:57,171 line:-2
System-provided colors,
like label or systemBackground,


78
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,475 line:-2
will automatically respond correctly
to changes in Dark Mode and system accent.


79
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,578 line:-1
You can also add your own adaptive colors


80
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,513 line:-2
by adding them
to the book's asset catalog.


81
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,750 line:-2
It's important to be aware
of the live-view safe area constraints


82
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,952 line:-1
when developing cross-platform content.


83
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,321 line:-2
These constraints ensure
that your content won't be hidden


84
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,023 line:-1
by any controls over the live view.


85
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,825 line:-1
The constraints are different on Mac,


86
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:22,429 line:-2
since there are toolbar buttons
over the top right of the Mac live view.


87
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:27,734 line:-2
You may have code that uses
the Live View Safe Area Guide property


88
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,204 line:-2
of a Playground
Live View Safe Area container.


89
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:35,175 line:-2
Now you can just access the safe area
using a standard UI layout guide.


90
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:38,812 line:-2
Next I'd like to introduce my teammate,
Grace, who will be showing you a demo.


91
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,381 line:-1
Thanks, Lizzy. My name is Grace,


92
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,151 line:-2
and I'll be walking through a demo
of a Playground that we've customized


93
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,919 line:-1
to work on both iPad and Mac.


94
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,822 line:-2
I'll open this Playground
in the Mac app first.


95
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,825 line:-2
You may recognize this turtle
from the Swan's Quest series.


96
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,093 line:-1
Pretty cute, right?


97
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,697 line:-2
The goal of this book is to customize
the look of your character.


98
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,999 line:-2
Once you've done that,
you can save it as an image


99
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,801 line:-1
and use it in the Swan's Quest book.


100
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:05,072 line:-2
The prose here says
to try starting with changeTurtleSkin.


101
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,740 line:-1
I'll start by typing that.


102
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,477 line:-1
And code completion shows me quick help


103
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,846 line:-2
for lots of different
customization methods.


104
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,414 line:-1
Let's look at how that's implemented.


105
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,487 line:-2
The customization methods
are in my TurtleEdits file.


106
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,724 line:-2
The text here,
preceded by three forward slashes,


107
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,060 line:-2
is what I see in the code completion area
for this method.


108
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,330 line:-2
I think this is a little vague,
so let's change this to:


109
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:34,635 line:-2
"Change the turtle's skin color
to the color provided."


110
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,838 line:-1
And once we go back to our main page...


111
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:43,210 line:-2
that's the text that shows up
in the code completion area.


112
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,613 line:-2
So let's add some customization
and see what happens.


113
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,417 line:-1
I'll run my code.


114
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,421 line:-2
All right,
this is a pretty good-looking turtle.


115
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,992 line:-2
I can use the UIColor popovers
to quickly change up some of the colors.


116
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:02,362 line:-2
I think I want the lighter area
of the shell to be more of a yellow.


117
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,333 line:-1
I'll run my code again.


118
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,336 line:-1
Perfect.


119
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,839 line:-1
I'll go ahead and save this image.


120
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:16,276 line:-2
Notice the use in pros of "tap,"
not "click," to use in other books.


121
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,278 line:-1
I also see in the prose


122
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,648 line:-2
it looks like we can play with AR
if we're on an iPad that supports it.


123
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,285 line:-2
I just so happen to have an iPad with me,
so I want to check that out.


124
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,723 line:-1
Here's my same document on iPad.


125
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,227 line:-2
I've got Dark Mode on,
so let's make sure it still looks good.


126
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:37,297 line:-2
Okay, hmm. When I run my code,
I have a pretty garish white background.


127
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:41,435 line:-2
That's because I set the background color
of my drawing to UIColor.white


128
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,504 line:-1
instead of using a system background.


129
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,607 line:-1
Let's try fixing that and run again.


130
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,449 line:-2
Okay, awesome.
So now the background matches my theme.


131
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:58,151 line:-2
And if I switch to Light mode,
it'll be white again.


132
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,988 line:-1
I also notice a new button here.


133
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,590 line:-2
That's because
in my ColorGridViewController...


134
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,894 line:-1
I have a target environment check.


135
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,364 line:-2
If not I'm running on macOS,
then show this button.


136
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,534 line:-2
Since Mac doesn't have
the required ARKit capabilities,


137
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,601 line:-1
I won't show it there.


138
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,539 line:-2
All right, so if I tap this button,
I can check out this turtle in AR.


139
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,379 line:-2
There's lots of ways to create great
content that works on both iPad and Mac.


140
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,215 line:-2
When you're creating or updating
your Swift Playgrounds content,


141
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,650 line:-1
keep these things in mind:


142
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,419 line:-1
Check out the UI on both iPad and Mac.


143
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:36,123 line:-2
You can take advantage of
the updated code completion design on Mac


144
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,458 line:-1
by providing quick help in your content.


145
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,795 line:-1
Use #if targetEnvironment checks


146
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,932 line:-2
to create different experiences
on iPad and Mac.


147
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,703 line:-2
If your content requires things like AR
or the microphone,


148
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,539 line:-1
specify these as required capabilities.


149
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:56,076 line:-2
If you can only support one device,
use the supportedDevices key.


150
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,746 line:-1
Lastly, respect the platform's settings,


151
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,483 line:-2
like Dark Mode, system colors,
and layout guidelines.


152
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,453 line:-2
And be sure to pay attention
to the accessibility experience


153
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,188 line:-1
on all devices that you support.


154
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,191 line:-2
You can download our sample content
along with this video


155
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,293 line:-2
and reference
