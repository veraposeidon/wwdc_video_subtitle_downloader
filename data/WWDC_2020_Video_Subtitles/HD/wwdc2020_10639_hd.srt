1
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,507 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,513 line:0
Hello. I'm Kevin Milden,
and I'm on Apple's Device Management team.


3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,714 line:-1
At Apple,


4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,884 line:-2
our team spends our time focused
on making devices easier to manage


5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,586 line:-2
across our platform apps
and services that you use.


6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:24,124 line:-2
Whether you're assigning sixth-graders
activities using Schoolwork on an iPad,


7
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,261 line:-2
setting up iPhones in your organization
for the first time,


8
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,830 line:-2
or using Apple Business Manager
to purchase apps and books


9
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,298 line:-1
for your organization,


10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,698 line:-1
it's Apple's hardware,


11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,068 line:-1
software and services


12
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,837 line:-1
that are at the center of your deployment.


13
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,706 line:-2
And this year,
we've made some significant strides


14
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:43,043 line:-2
in bringing numerous crucial
device-management features to the Mac.


15
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,981 line:-2
Today, we're gonna start by reviewing
how you can deploy, manage and secure


16
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,650 line:-1
macOS Big Sur.


17
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,453 line:-2
Setting up and deploying Macs
has never been easier.


18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,088 line:-1
With essential services from Apple,


19
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,825 line:-2
your organization can quickly deploy
and support Macs at scale.


20
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,162 line:-2
Our vision of enrollment
requires nothing more than unboxing a Mac


21
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,497 line:-1
and booting it up.


22
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,568 line:-2
And we're delivering on that promise
with Automated Device Enrollment.


23
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,738 line:-2
All the user needs to do is select
their language and connect to Wi-Fi.


24
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,443 line:-2
It automatically enrolls
organization-owned devices into MDM,


25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,812 line:-2
so you don't have to touch them
before you hand them out.


26
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,983 line:-2
Enrollment Customization allows you
to add branding, consent text,


27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,853 line:-2
and use modern authentication
during the setup process.


28
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,722 line:-2
It provides a better experience
while using new auth vendors,


29
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:32,860 line:-2
such as Microsoft Azure Active Directory,
Okta, Ping, and more.


30
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,296 line:-2
Using the credentials
from your identity provider


31
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,898 line:-1
in Enrollment Customization,


32
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:41,101 line:-2
you can pre-populate the user's full name
and short name.


33
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,537 line:-2
We are also introducing
the ability to choose


34
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,607 line:-2
if the account can enable
user-channel management too.


35
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,775 line:-1
After creating a user account,


36
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,312 line:-2
you can customize the setup process
to meet your organization's needs.


37
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,048 line:-1
Choose which steps to hide and show,


38
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,720 line:-2
such as Siri, Touch ID, FileVault,
Analytics, Location, and more.


39
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,726 line:-2
With Automated Device Enrollment,
there's no step three.


40
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,227 line:-1
You land at the desktop.


41
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,999 line:-2
Automated Device Enrollment enables you
to automate MDM enrollment


42
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,834 line:-1
and simplify device setup.


43
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,737 line:-2
You can supervise devices
during activation without touching them,


44
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,773 line:-2
as well as lock MDM enrollment
for ongoing management.


45
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,543 line:-2
A few years ago,
we introduced a new feature


46
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,412 line:-2
that makes it easy
to set up Apple TVs at scale.


47
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,248 line:-2
It's been very successful
and we're bringing it to the Mac.


48
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,019 line:-2
All that you do is plug in power
and connect Ethernet.


49
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:33,720 line:-1
And then boot it up...


50
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,025 line:-2
and all of the setup screens
are automatically skipped.


51
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,493 line:-1
You land right at log-in.


52
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,796 line:-2
It's the fastest way to set up a Mac,
and we think you're gonna love it.


53
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,333 line:-2
Auto Advance
for Automated Device Enrollment


54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,168 line:-1
makes it easy to set up a Mac.


55
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:51,171 line:-2
It requires you to manage your devices
using Apple Business Manager


56
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,840 line:-1
or Apple School Manager.


57
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:57,177 line:-2
Only power and Ethernet are required,
but your network must support DHCP.


58
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,248 line:-2
Skip all the Setup Assistant steps
and reach log-in within seconds,


59
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,684 line:-1
or customize the setup to meet your needs.


60
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,185 line:-1
And if you use encrypted disks,


61
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,354 line:-2
you will be required
to enter your password.


62
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,023 line:-2
Now, I've got one more
deployment feature for the Mac


63
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,059 line:-1
that I really want to tell you about.


64
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,595 line:-1
And yes, it's for the new Mac Pro.


65
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,800 line:-1
It's called Lights Out Management,


66
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,537 line:-2
and will enable admins
to deploy Mac Pros at scale.


67
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,974 line:-2
You can start up, shut down, and reboot
one or more Macs remotely


68
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,742 line:-1
even if they're unresponsive.


69
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,778 line:-2
This is accomplished
by sending a command from your MDM server


70
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,448 line:-2
to the MDM-enrolled controller
on your Mac network.


71
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,751 line:-2
Lights Out Management
requires macOS Big Sur,


72
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,120 line:-2
and your Mac Pros must
be on the same subnet.


73
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:44,324 line:-2
And you're going to want to install
the Lights Out Management payload too.


74
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,826 line:-1
Here's how it works.


75
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,695 line:-2
You'll need to enroll a Mac
to act as the controller


76
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,330 line:-1
on your local network.


77
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,966 line:-2
And you'll need all the Mac Pros
to enroll as well.


78
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,971 line:0
Then connect all the Mac Pros
to the enrolled LOM controller Mac.


79
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,277 line:-1
Send the command to your MDM server.


80
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,747 line:-2
Your MDM vendor will need to support
the new Mac commands


81
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,182 line:-1
in order for this to work.


82
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,685 line:0
The LOM controller Mac
receives the command


83
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,987 line:0
and distributes them
to each of the Mac Pros.


84
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,692 line:-2
Lights Out Management for the new Mac Pro
is an awesome new feature,


85
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,594 line:-2
and we hope
that you'll take advantage of it.


86
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,664 line:-2
These terrific new enhancements
to deployment


87
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,800 line:-2
will help you set up Macs at scale
faster than ever before.


88
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,405 line:-2
But once you have your Macs deployed,
what about ongoing management?


89
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,307 line:-1
Let's start with Supervision.


90
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,011 line:-2
Supervision gives admins greater control
of how devices operate.


91
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,414 line:-2
We're making a change this year
that you've been waiting for.


92
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,718 line:-2
Previously, User Approved MDM
didn't have the same capabilities


93
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,854 line:-1
as Automated Device Enrolled Macs.


94
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,522 line:-1
Not anymore.


95
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:53,927 line:-2
Any Mac enrolled in a User Approved MDM
will now be considered supervised.


96
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,365 line:-2
Admins have the same special abilities
such as controlling activation lock


97
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,200 line:-1
and leveraging bootstrap tokens,


98
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,804 line:-2
just as they do if the device was enrolled
using Automated Device Enrollment.


99
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:09,142 line:-2
You can query and list local users
and choose to delete them,


100
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,247 line:-2
as well as replace or remove profiles
and install supervised restrictions,


101
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,415 line:-1
using MDM commands, and...


102
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,251 line:-1
schedule software updates.


103
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:21,054 line:-2
We've learned a lot from
Managed Software Updates on iOS and iPadOS


104
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,557 line:-2
and we want to bring that same experience
to the Mac.


105
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,461 line:-2
There's a number of new MDM commands
for Software Update,


106
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:31,765 line:-2
including forcing client Macs to accept
software updates and then restart.


107
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:37,037 line:-2
Major releases of macOS and non-OS updates
can now be deferred up to 90 days.


108
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,339 line:-2
And we've made a few changes
to increase security,


109
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,808 line:-2
such as the removal
of the software update catalog,


110
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,344 line:-2
as well as the Ignore Flag
for major updates only.


111
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,947 line:-2
Now, that's the story
for Managed Software Updates,


112
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,415 line:-1
but what about apps?


113
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,085 line:-2
Managed apps have been a terrific feature
on iOS for many years,


114
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:54,087 line:-1
and we wanna bring it to the Mac too.


115
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,824 line:-2
You can now remove apps
using MDM commands,


116
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,294 line:-2
or they can be removed
on device un-enrollment.


117
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,664 line:-2
Managed app configuration
and feedback are supported,


118
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,099 line:-1
just as they are on iOS and iPadOS.


119
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,238 line:-2
And if eligible, you can convert
unmanaged apps to managed using MDM.


120
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,442 line:0
User enrolled devices
that have managed apps installed


121
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,244 line:-1
do not support conversion.


122
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,982 line:-2
Apps have always been the cornerstone
of the macOS experience,


123
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,517 line:-1
but as cool as they are,


124
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,752 line:-2
large apps can include
additional components


125
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,222 line:-2
that need to be downloaded
to each of your clients.


126
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,091 line:-2
Doing that can slow things down
and use up valuable time.


127
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,829 line:-2
Which is why we hope you're using
content caching to reduce Internet usage,


128
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,232 line:-2
while speeding up the rate
of downloading of apps,


129
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:42,302 line:-2
books, iCloud content, GarageBand music,
software updates,


130
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,338 line:-1
Xcode components and so much more.


131
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,375 line:-2
There are over two dozen data types
supported by content caching.


132
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,278 line:-1
We've added support for Internet Recovery.


133
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,213 line:-1
The initial boot image isn't included,


134
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,550 line:-2
but the full six-gigabyte recovery image
is cached,


135
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:59,186 line:-2
which will restore Macs on your network
faster than ever.


136
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,924 line:-2
When we integrated content caching
into macOS a few years ago,


137
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:08,028 line:-2
we included a new tab in Activity Monitor
that displays key performance metrics


138
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,664 line:-2
to help you understand
how your content is being used.


139
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,834 line:-2
We're now making those metrics
available to you


140
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:17,804 line:-2
using the new
"Content Caching Information" MDM command.


141
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:21,375 line:-2
They help you determine if content caching
is turned on, working,


142
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,677 line:-2
and helping your clients
download content faster.


143
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,181 line:-2
It gives you the information
about registration state,


144
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,117 line:-2
cache pressure, bytes served
and so much more.


145
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,251 line:-1
As a developer,


146
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,955 line:-2
please resist the urge to set this command
repeatedly at high frequency,


147
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:38,992 line:-2
as it really wasn't intended to be used
like it is in Activity Monitor.


148
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,062 line:-2
There's a bunch of great new features
for content caching,


149
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,931 line:-2
and we hope that you'll
take advantage of them


150
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:47,367 line:-2
to speed up downloading of content
to the devices on your network.


151
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,771 line:-2
Now, just as we have
with deployment and management,


152
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:55,075 line:-2
we're also bringing a number of
security improvements from iOS to the Mac.


153
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,177 line:-1
At Apple,


154
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:00,447 line:-2
we strive to strike the right balance
between improving security


155
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,916 line:-2
and preserving
effortless deployment workflows.


156
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:07,688 line:-2
Today, we are introducing more things
you can do with bootstrap tokens.


157
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,124 line:-2
A bootstrap token
is a reserved encryption key


158
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:15,028 line:-2
provided by your MDM server that
enables macOS to create admin accounts


159
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,698 line:-2
without needing to authenticate
with an admin password.


160
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,302 line:-2
Historically, admins would need to create
complicated workflows


161
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:26,273 line:-2
to create accounts on the system
and then add individual user accounts.


162
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:27,975 line:-1
Not anymore.


163
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,445 line:-2
Bootstrap tokens enable users
to get a secure token


164
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:34,114 line:-1
and boot a Mac that uses FileVault.


165
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,784 line:-2
This is a really useful feature
if you used networked accounts.


166
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:42,623 line:-2
Bootstrap tokens improve
the log-in workflow for mobile accounts.


167
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,224 line:-1
Once implemented,


168
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,960 line:-2
admins can take advantage
of authorized software updates


169
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,362 line:-1
and kernel extensions.


170
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,598 line:-2
Bootstrap tokens are supported
on the latest Macs


171
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,067 line:-1
with the Apple T2 Security Chip.


172
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,837 line:-1
Please review developer documentation


173
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:59,973 line:-2
to learn more about
bootstrap tokens in your deployment.


174
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:03,510 line:-2
Now let's talk about how
we took measures to protect users.


175
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:07,948 line:-2
You might be asked to install a profile
that was sent to you in an e-mail,


176
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,050 line:-1
or one that was downloaded in a web page.


177
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,719 line:-1
Since profiles can configure your device,


178
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,155 line:-2
we need to make sure that
we don't install them accidentally


179
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,890 line:-1
from people that you don't trust.


180
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,795 line:-2
In iOS and iPadOS,
we introduced Downloaded Profiles.


181
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,798 line:-2
This is where we isolate a profile
that's been downloaded.


182
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,635 line:-2
We have you install it manually
by paying a visit to Settings.


183
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,171 line:-1
It's designed to help protect customers.


184
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,810 line:-2
We're bringing Downloaded Profiles
to the Mac


185
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,279 line:-1
to offer the same security benefits.


186
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,782 line:-2
When you download a profile,
you'll receive a notification


187
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,617 line:-1
that you can review it in Settings.


188
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,186 line:-1
Visit System Profiles pane


189
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,122 line:-2
and you'll see a new group
labeled "Downloaded Profiles".


190
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,626 line:-2
Here you can preview the profile
and click "Install."


191
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,461 line:-2
Confirm that you actually
want to install it,


192
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,930 line:-2
and enter your password
to complete the installation.


193
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,767 line:-2
Profiles can modify the way
your device is configured,


194
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:04,137 line:-2
and we want users to take
an informed decision when installing them.


195
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,641 line:-2
As an MDM developer, you're going to want
to consider the challenges


196
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,644 line:-2
that Downloaded Profiles poses
to your deployment workflows.


197
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:12,980 line:-1
Once a profile is downloaded,


198
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,249 line:-2
it remains in the System Preferences
for eight minutes


199
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,218 line:-2
before it is removed
from the System Preferences pane.


200
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,023 line:-1
As we informed you previously,


201
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,259 line:-2
we've continued to make
security enhancements


202
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,060 line:-1
that impact several command line tools


203
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,196 line:-2
that you may be using
in your deployment workflows.


204
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,832 line:-1
As of macOS Big Sur,


205
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,502 line:-2
you will no longer be able to completely
install profiles using Terminal.


206
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,007 line:-2
When you attempt to install a profile
via the command line,


207
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,544 line:-2
it will treat it as if it was downloaded,
and you'll have to complete the install


208
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,146 line:-2
in the Profiles System Preferences pane
manually.


209
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,049 line:-2
All other features of
the profiles command line tool


210
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:52,286 line:-2
will remain the same
and continue to work as expected.


211
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,723 line:-2
In addition to changes
to the profiles command line tool,


212
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,794 line:-2
macOS Big Sur also includes a tool
called networksetup


213
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:04,398 line:-2
that makes it easy to view and edit
your network settings using Terminal.


214
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,834 line:-2
The problem is that admins
and standard users


215
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,970 line:-2
had the same abilities
to view and modify network settings


216
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,171 line:-1
from the command line.


217
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,342 line:-2
We've now imbued these account types
with different abilities


218
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,311 line:-1
when using the networksetup tool.


219
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,215 line:-2
We've also hardened security
by honoring the setting


220
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:25,052 line:-2
that requires your admin password
when modifying system-wide preferences.


221
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,422 line:-2
Here's some detail around
networksetup tool.


222
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,159 line:-2
Admins and standard users now have
different capabilities.


223
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,062 line:-2
Standard users can only
read network settings,


224
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,165 line:-2
turn on and off Wi-Fi,
and change the access point.


225
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:41,835 line:-2
They no longer have the same
unbridled capabilities that admins do.


226
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,671 line:0
Tick the checkbox to require your password


227
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,241 line:0
when modifying settings
in Security and Privacy,


228
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:50,010 line:0
but admins can
get around this by using sudo.


229
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,547 line:-2
There's one more significant
security enhancement


230
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:55,015 line:-1
that you should be aware of.


231
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,185 line:-2
Automated Device Enrollment
uses device serial numbers


232
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:00,554 line:-2
to know which devices
to enroll at activation.


233
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:04,691 line:0
Serial numbers contain
bits of identifiable information,


234
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:08,028 line:0
like where and when the device was built.


235
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,732 line:0
These 12-character numbers
help Apple target devices made


236
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:15,102 line:0
at the same time in the same place
to maintain quality.


237
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:20,073 line:-2
To address identifiable information
being used maliciously,


238
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,342 line:-2
we're going to start issuing
completely random


239
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,312 line:-2
10-character serial numbers
across our product line.


240
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,184 line:-2
As an MDM vendor, you depend
on Automated Device Enrollment


241
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,452 line:-1
and serial numbers to identify devices.


242
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,822 line:-2
You'll need to take
the new serial number format change


243
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,591 line:-1
into account within your products.


244
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,960 line:-1
Third-party solutions must be capable


245
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,829 line:-2
of handling both the current
product serial number formats


246
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,399 line:-2
and the newly updated format
at the same time.


247
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,203 line:-2
There are a number of
other new device management features,


248
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,838 line:-1
restrictions and commands


249
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,107 line:-2
that MDM vendors can now
take advantage of in macOS Big Sur.


250
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:57,110 line:-2
Please consult
our updated configuration profile


251
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:02,115 line:-2
and MDM protocol reference documentation
at developer.apple.com to learn more.


252
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:07,754 line:-2
It's a big year for the Mac,
but the latest release of iOS and iPadOS


253
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:11,124 line:-2
have tons of great device-management
features included this year too.


254
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,528 line:-2
From Shared iPad for Business
and Temporary Session


255
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:17,197 line:-2
to Shortcuts now supporting
Managed Open-In,


256
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,601 line:-2
iOS and iPadOS
have a ton to offer administrators.


257
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,671 line:-2
Just like with Mac,
we're going to focus on how admins


258
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:28,475 line:-2
can deploy, manage,
and secure iOS and iPadOS too.


259
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,412 line:-1
Let's start with deployment.


260
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,216 line:-2
And when time is of the essence,
Apple Configurator


261
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:41,154 line:-2
helps you mass-configure iPhones, iPads
and Apple TVs fast using a USB cable.


262
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:45,459 line:-2
Apple Configurator now supports
Apps and Books Locations


263
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:48,929 line:-2
that are provided by Apple School Manager
and Apple Business Manager.


264
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:51,365 line:-2
Locations are different places
where devices are kept.


265
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,700 line:-1
For example, an institution may use


266
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,502 line:-2
a completely different set
of apps and books


267
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,172 line:-2
at an elementary school
than they do at a high school.


268
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:01,241 line:-2
With this new feature,
admins can now go to the Account menu


269
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,343 line:-2
and select the Location
they'd like to use.


270
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:07,514 line:-2
That displays an entirely different set
of apps and books for each Location


271
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,583 line:-2
that has been configured in
Apple School Manager


272
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,218 line:-1
or Apple Business Manager.


273
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,387 line:-2
This is a critical feature
for our customers


274
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,955 line:-1
and we're excited to introduce it.


275
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,525 line:-2
In addition to Locations,
cfgutil is now more scalable


276
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:21,929 line:-2
and can restore larger numbers of devices
than ever before.


277
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,297 line:-1
And if you didn't notice,


278
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,900 line:-2
Apple Configurator sports a brand-new look
in macOS Big Sur.


279
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:31,004 line:-2
Now let's turn to a few more additions
in iOS deployment.


280
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:36,143 line:-2
Automated Device Enrollment enables you
to customize the Setup Assistant


281
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,379 line:-2
to simplify MDM enrollment
and device setup.


282
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,315 line:-1
It enables you to get to the Home Screen


283
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,083 line:-2
without needing to use
the Setup Assistant.


284
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,587 line:-2
And we're adding new skip keys
for the new Getting Started


285
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:50,324 line:-1
and Update Completed panes in iOS 14.


286
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:55,329 line:-2
We've now brought
the Setup Assistant payload to iOS,


287
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,532 line:-2
although it works a little differently
than on macOS.


288
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:01,468 line:-2
Using the payload,
you specify the same skip keys


289
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:04,071 line:-1
you use with Automated Device Enrollment,


290
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,007 line:-2
and then they will take effect
during future upgrades.


291
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,909 line:-1
The payload offers two benefits.


292
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:14,181 line:-2
First, it allows you to skip
Setup Assistant panes during an upgrade


293
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,284 line:-2
that you didn't know about
when initially setting up the device.


294
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:20,387 line:-2
And second,
skipping the setup panes during upgrade


295
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:23,323 line:-1
is now possible on all supervised devices,


296
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,993 line:-2
not just those enrolled using
Apple School Manager


297
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,528 line:-1
and Apple Business Manager.


298
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,796 line:-1
I would now like to discuss


299
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,099 line:-2
one of my favorite
device-management features:


300
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,967 line:-1
Shared iPad.


301
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:37,704 line:-2
It allows students to have
a personal experience on a shared device.


302
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:42,576 line:-2
Shared iPad gives schools the ability
to provide each and every student


303
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,244 line:-1
with a personalized experience,


304
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,714 line:-2
and their own data
even if the students are sharing iPads.


305
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,051 line:-2
Earlier this year,
we added some great new features


306
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,987 line:-2
to expand the ways
in which Shared iPad can be used


307
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,723 line:-2
in different types of organizations,
not only schools.


308
00:15:57,558 --> 00:16:01,895 line:-2
Shared iPad for Business can be configured
using Apple Business Manager,


309
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:06,099 line:-2
just as you do to configure it
for students in Apple School Manager.


310
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,171 line:-2
Employees can sign in to a shared iPad
using their Managed Apple ID.


311
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:14,975 line:-2
This is a great feature for
service businesses such as restaurants,


312
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,579 line:-2
where you can deploy shared devices
to take orders from customers.


313
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:23,016 line:-2
If you use
Microsoft Azure Active Directory,


314
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,253 line:-2
your users can now sign in
using federated authentication.


315
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:30,724 line:-2
And Shared iPad now supports
the new Single Sign-on Extension too.


316
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,693 line:-1
But wait, there's more.


317
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,463 line:-2
Shared iPad now supports
dynamic numbers of cached users,


318
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,532 line:-2
which allows you
to set the amount of storage


319
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,301 line:-2
for each user,
instead of a fixed number of users.


320
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:45,706 line:-2
You can also now delete all users
from a shared iPad at once,


321
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,876 line:-2
and we have added queries
for estimated resident users


322
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:49,977 line:-1
and quota size.


323
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,248 line:-2
And a highly requested feature
called Temporary Session.


324
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,985 line:-2
A Temporary Session further expands
the way a shared iPad


325
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:01,555 line:-2
can be used in different organizations
by allowing a user


326
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:04,491 line:-2
to sign in temporarily
without needing an account.


327
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:06,627 line:-1
When you sign out,


328
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,163 line:-2
all the data the user created
during the session will be deleted.


329
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,433 line:-2
It's a quick and easy way
for people to start using a shared iPad


330
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,868 line:-1
without a Managed Apple ID.


331
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:21,541 line:-2
Those are all the new deployment features
we've introduced in iOS and iPadOS 14.


332
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,077 line:-1
Now let's review what we're going to do


333
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:27,247 line:-2
to make managing iPhones
and iPads even better.


334
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,084 line:-1
First up is non-removable managed Apps,


335
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,687 line:-2
a great new feature that admins
will be excited about.


336
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:38,592 line:-2
Previously, admins could completely lock
the Home Screen


337
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,727 line:-1
and prevent the deletion of all apps,


338
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,730 line:-2
which constrained the user's ability
to manage their own apps.


339
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:47,868 line:-2
Now users can continue to rearrange
their apps and install new apps,


340
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:50,270 line:-2
and delete other apps
that they've installed.


341
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:53,407 line:-2
And admins can mark
only mission-critical managed apps


342
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:54,575 line:-1
as non-removable.


343
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:59,012 line:-2
When your users try to delete
or off-load a managed app,


344
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,515 line:-1
it prevents it and displays an alert.


345
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,953 line:-2
Non-removable managed apps
ensures that your users


346
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,689 line:-2
always have the apps they need
on their devices.


347
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,025 line:-2
You can now mark specific managed apps
as non-removable,


348
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,429 line:-2
which will prevent the user
from removing or off-loading them.


349
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,433 line:-2
Just like organizations want to be able
to have some control


350
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,702 line:-2
over their apps
on their employees' devices,


351
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:25,138 line:-2
they also want to keep a tight control
over their proprietary data.


352
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:29,243 line:-2
And this year, we've added several
new ways to maintain that control.


353
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,413 line:-2
Let's start with a great new
iOS productivity feature, Shortcuts.


354
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:37,284 line:-2
Shortcuts deliver a quick way
you can get things done


355
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:40,454 line:-2
with your apps,
or with just a tap by asking Siri.


356
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,724 line:-1
By Shortcuts supporting Managed Open-In,


357
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,926 line:-1
when a shortcut triggers an action


358
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:49,129 line:-2
where data flow is not allowed
because of the device policy...


359
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,132 line:-2
the shortcut will immediately
stop running.


360
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,302 line:-1
We do this by controlling the flow of data


361
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:58,372 line:-2
to make sure that managed data
does not get shared


362
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:01,508 line:-2
with unmanaged apps and services,
and vice versa.


363
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:04,178 line:-2
This makes certain
that your organization's data


364
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,046 line:-1
does not fall into the wrong hands.


365
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:09,983 line:-2
Building on preventing sensitive data
from being shared,


366
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,286 line:-1
let's turn to notifications.


367
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,189 line:-2
Organizations want to ensure
that sensitive information


368
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,524 line:-1
cannot be revealed without user intent,


369
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,361 line:-2
so we've added a setting
to control notification previews to help.


370
00:19:22,196 --> 00:19:25,599 line:-2
It's a new key
in the Notification Settings payload


371
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,034 line:-1
called "Preview Type,"


372
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,170 line:-2
which controls when previews
are shown in notifications:


373
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:34,441 line:-2
never, always, or only after the user
has unlocked their device.


374
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:38,679 line:-2
The new key is only respected
on supervised devices,


375
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:42,249 line:-2
and will help your organization
keep your data private and secure.


376
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,719 line:-2
Now, I have just one more
management feature


377
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:46,987 line:-1
I would like to share with you


378
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:49,022 line:-2
before we move on
to our security features.


379
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,993 line:-1
Managing remote devices around the world


380
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,996 line:-2
is something that
we are all becoming more familiar with.


381
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,833 line:-2
Let's say you have employees
that are located across multiple countries


382
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,436 line:-1
and some of them don't use Location.


383
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:06,139 line:-2
It really doesn't make a lot of sense
for their devices to be configured


384
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,776 line:-2
to use the time zone
of your MDM server by default.


385
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:14,481 line:-2
Time management of endpoints
is a critical function of key services.


386
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,050 line:-2
If set incorrectly,
it could cause serious problems,


387
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:18,719 line:-1
such as authentication issues.


388
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:23,123 line:-2
So, we're introducing
the new Set Timezone MDM command


389
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,826 line:-2
that allows you to choose the time zone
for each device.


390
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:29,997 line:-2
And it's not dependent
on Location Services whatsoever.


391
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,033 line:-2
Make sure you review
developer documentation to learn more


392
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,536 line:-2
about how you can take advantage
of this new command.


393
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,505 line:-2
And those are just some
of the new management features


394
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:42,075 line:-2
we are bringing to iOS
and iPadOS 14 this year.


395
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:45,979 line:-2
But what can we do to continue to improve
the security of your devices?


396
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,449 line:-2
In this section, we will cover
some changes coming this year


397
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,552 line:-1
that will impact deployment workflows,


398
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,387 line:-2
as well as
some new management capabilities


399
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,890 line:-2
you can use to secure iPhones and iPads
in your organization.


400
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,993 line:-1
VPN, or virtual private networks


401
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,564 line:-2
let people send and receive data
across public networks.


402
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:07,401 line:-2
There are three types
of VPN that iOS supports:


403
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,870 line:-2
full tunnel,
which all traffic can flow through,


404
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:13,006 line:-2
split tunnel, which chooses
which traffic can flow through it,


405
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:15,809 line:-1
and we've added support for per-app VPN,


406
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:18,946 line:-2
which only lets certain apps' data
flow through it.


407
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,883 line:-2
Today, we're going to add support
for you to choose


408
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,352 line:-1
which VPN your accounts should use.


409
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:29,590 line:-1
This is called Per Account VPN for iOS,


410
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,059 line:-2
and it allows you
to choose a replacement VPN


411
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,628 line:-1
for Contacts, Calendars and Mail domains.


412
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:37,664 line:-2
You can associate
an individual account with VPN,


413
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:39,600 line:-1
just like you can the traffic of an app.


414
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,437 line:-2
Developers only need
to replace the keys in the domain payload


415
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:45,372 line:-1
to take advantage of this new feature.


416
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,675 line:-2
Since we're on the topic
of encrypted traffic,


417
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,677 line:-1
you can now encrypt your DNS too.


418
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,681 line:-2
Most of our traffic is encrypted
when we talk to a server,


419
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:57,918 line:-2
but when we talk to a DNS server,
those connections aren't secure.


420
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:00,687 line:-1
So, in addition to Per Account VPN,


421
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:04,057 line:-2
we're also introducing
encrypted DNS settings.


422
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,261 line:-2
Encrypted DNS
allows you to enhance security


423
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,263 line:-1
without needing to configure a VPN.


424
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:13,367 line:-2
iOS already supports
the standard for secure DNS,


425
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:17,237 line:-2
now we're providing the ability
to manage it via MDM as well.


426
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:21,008 line:-2
Let's talk about
just one more new security feature


427
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,376 line:-1
we've included this year.


428
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,847 line:-2
Beginning in iOS 14, whenever a device
associates with a Wi-Fi network


429
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:29,683 line:-1
it will use a random MAC address


430
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,819 line:-2
instead of the device's
true hardware MAC address.


431
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:36,890 line:-2
For enterprise networks
that use captive portals or filtering,


432
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:39,826 line:-2
the new feature may cause
an unexpected behavior,


433
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:42,930 line:-2
as the device
may not be identified when it joins.


434
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:45,399 line:-1
If the device fails to join the network,


435
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,035 line:-2
it will fall back
to using its real MAC address.


436
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:50,971 line:-2
While users can disable
this feature in Settings,


437
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,308 line:-2
we've also made it possible
to disable it using the Wi-Fi payload.


438
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:57,077 line:-1
As there were for macOS Big Sur,


439
00:22:57,144 --> 00:23:00,013 line:-2
there are a number of other new
device-management features,


440
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,381 line:-1
restrictions and commands


441
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:06,253 line:-2
that MDM vendors can now take advantage of
in iOS, iPadOS and tvOS.


442
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:09,356 line:-2
Please consult
our updated configuration profile


443
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:14,494 line:-2
and MDM protocol reference documentation
at developer.apple.com to learn more.


444
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:21,368 line:-2
Thanks for joining me to learn what's new
in managing Apple's devices at WWDC 2020.


445
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,004 line:-2
We hope you'll take advantage
of the great new features


446
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,906 line:-1
across our platforms this year.


447
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:26,974 line:-1
Thanks.
