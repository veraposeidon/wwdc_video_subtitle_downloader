00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:07,074 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,744 line:0
Hi. My name's Mark Mikin,


3
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:14,214 line:0
and I'm the Siri Experience Evangelist
here at Apple.


4
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,586 line:-2
I know this is WWDC,
but it wouldn't quite be WW


5
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,856 line:-2
if we didn't have a session
about why you should build something


6
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:26,560 line:-2
in addition to all the awesome videos
we've made about how to build it.


7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,396 line:-1
And this is one of those "why" sessions.


8
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:33,100 line:-2
In particular, we want to talk about
something we call system intelligence


9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:37,037 line:-2
from a few different perspectives
and over the course of a few videos.


10
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:41,308 line:-2
First we'll define it, and then
I'll talk about how it relates to design


11
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,077 line:-2
and then how it's powered
by extensibility.


12
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,814 line:-2
So now let's explain
what we mean when we say


13
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,384 line:-1
"the intelligent system experience."


14
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,087 line:-2
You've probably heard terms
at previous WWDCs


15
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,856 line:0
like "proactive,"


16
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:59,159 line:0
and being proactive is a key part of this.


17
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,962 line:-1
Another piece of it is Siri,


18
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:04,765 line:-2
which is why I,
the Siri Experience Evangelist,


19
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,200 line:-1
am here talking to you.


20
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,236 line:-2
So over the course
of the next several videos,


21
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:13,540 line:-2
my colleagues at Apple, the ones
that actually work on these technologies,


22
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,243 line:-2
will help me define
just exactly what we mean


23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,046 line:0
when we say
"intelligent system experience"


24
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,382 line:0
and what you can do
to be a part of that system.


25
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,319 line:-2
Let's get started
with the most basic definition,


26
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,454 line:-2
which we'll build on
throughout these videos.


27
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,991 line:-1
I found the simplest way to explain it


28
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:33,627 line:-1
is that it's how the operating system


29
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,430 line:-2
works with the apps
that people use every day


30
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,266 line:-1
to make "the everyday" easier for people.


31
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,335 line:-1
And that's intelligence.


32
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:46,373 line:-2
Now, it's easy to view the features
we place under this umbrella,


33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,677 line:-2
like Voice and Siri Suggestions,
as a convenience.


34
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,446 line:-1
It makes something easier,


35
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:55,048 line:-2
and you could keep doing it
the hard way if you wanted,


36
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,519 line:-2
but that's not quite the right way
to look at it.


37
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,155 line:0
Intelligence should be viewed
as a design practice.


38
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:06,493 line:0
In fact, it's a design that's, in a way,
alive.


39
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:10,330 line:-2
So let's talk about this concept
of a living design.


40
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,798 line:-1
What do we mean by that?


41
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,836 line:-2
Well, ultimately,
what's the core job of a designer?


42
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,139 line:-1
It's to help people accomplish something.


43
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,743 line:-2
And one of the key ways
a designer enables this


44
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,645 line:-1
is by leveraging the familiar.


45
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,414 line:-2
Take this, for example:
the "share" button.


46
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,318 line:-2
When someone using an app
wants to share something,


47
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,755 line:-2
how is this capability conveyed
to the person using the app?


48
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,824 line:-1
By using a signifier, or a symbol.


49
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,095 line:-2
In the case of iOS,
someone can easily recognize this symbol


50
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,633 line:-2
because it consistently gets used
across our apps and yours.


51
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,103 line:-2
In other words,
it's a platform convention.


52
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,605 line:-1
And guess what?


53
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,374 line:0
Intelligence is a platform convention too.


54
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,311 line:0
It's something enabled and reinforced


55
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,681 line:0
by its consistent appearance
on the platform.


56
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183 line:-1
But unlike other forms of design,


57
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,221 line:-2
intelligence isn't a static glyph or icon
like the "share" button.


58
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,388 line:-1
It's alive.


59
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:12,726 line:-2
It manifests itself
by adapting to how the system,


60
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:16,930 line:-2
the platform,
conforms to how people use their devices.


61
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:22,169 line:-2
No two people's Siri Suggestions
or conversations with Siri are alike.


62
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:27,407 line:-2
And what's needed or suggested
can change at any second.


63
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:30,477 line:-2
The more we do that,
with the help of your apps,


64
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,914 line:-1
the more people's expectations change.


65
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:40,587 line:0
People expect their devices and the apps
installed on them to be smart.


66
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:45,025 line:0
And "smart" is clearly a loaded term,
as is "intelligence."


67
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:49,263 line:0
We all know that people get frustrated
when their expectations aren't met.


68
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:54,568 line:-2
When something doesn't feel as smart
or as helpful as they think it should be,


69
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,937 line:-2
they don't care if it's the system
or the app's fault.


70
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,839 line:-1
It just doesn't feel quite right.


71
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,643 line:-2
So as an app developer,
you have a big responsibility.


72
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:06,280 line:-2
After all,
apps are a key piece of this story


73
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,316 line:-1
through something we call extensibility.


74
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,887 line:-2
Before we go deeper on how intelligence is
powered by an app through extensibility,


75
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,757 line:-1
let's first define what an app even is.


76
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,793 line:-2
The simplest way to look at it
is that an app is an app icon,


77
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,697 line:-2
and when I tap on it,
I get this awesome experience.


78
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,034 line:-2
When I swipe away, I close the app,
and then I'm done.


79
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,571 line:-2
The next time I want to use that app,
I tap on the app icon again,


80
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,972 line:-1
and I'm right back in.


81
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,109 line:-2
And for many people,
that's still how they use an app today.


82
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,478 line:-2
But apps have actually been evolving
over time,


83
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,415 line:-2
and that's something
that we've been working toward for years.


84
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:46,587 line:-2
Like when we debuted the very first
app extensions six years ago


85
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,255 line:-1
at WW 2014.


86
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,392 line:-1
And when we debuted SiriKit at WW 2016,


87
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,596 line:-2
we used that same foundation
of app extensions


88
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,699 line:-2
to allow apps to work with Siri
for the very first time.


89
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,267 line:-1
And then there were shortcuts,


90
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,036 line:-2
and now we have the new widgets
and app clips.


91
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,373 line:-2
And it's not like we've been building
a bunch of software features


92
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,775 line:-1
just to make the operating system better.


93
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:13,046 line:-2
A lot of the technologies that are
foundational to the intelligent system


94
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:17,150 line:-2
were actually built to help
our growing ecosystem of devices.


95
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:21,889 line:-2
Like with Handoff, which first started
with iPad, iPhone and Mac,


96
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,892 line:-2
but was really crucial
for enabling Apple Watch.


97
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:28,495 line:-2
And the next thing you know,
we have this intelligent glue


98
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:33,033 line:-2
that ties together all of our devices
and apps and the operating system


99
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,769 line:-1
to make everyday stuff easier for people.


100
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:40,140 line:-2
And this intelligent system
we're building with your help


101
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,842 line:-1
is built from the ground up


102
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,912 line:-2
from a foundation
of respecting your privacy.


103
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,815 line:-2
You'll hear more about that later,
but no intelligent system


104
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:52,786 line:-2
is worth sacrificing
a fundamental human right for.


105
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,355 line:-1
Now, in the following videos,


106
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,392 line:-2
we'll try and cover system intelligence
from a few different angles.


107
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,662 line:-2
First up,
we'll expand on this common theme


108
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,698 line:-2
of how intelligence,
paired with extensibility,


109
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,801 line:-2
allows for quick interactions
that save people time.


110
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,840 line:-2
We'll also walk through how we measure
a successful intelligent interaction


111
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:17,010 line:-2
and how there's a measurable impact
on the value people get out of your apps.


112
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,814 line:-2
Then we'll walk you through how,
without even knowing it,


113
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,818 line:-2
people can benefit from intelligence
features throughout their user journey


114
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,553 line:-1
to help people become more proficient


115
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,256 line:-2
at taking advantage
of their phones and their apps.


116
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,125 line:-2
Sometimes
even before they download an app.


117
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,995 line:-2
Then a few more of our colleagues
will talk you through


118
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,731 line:-2
some of the underlying technologies
that power it.


119
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,968 line:-2
There are three key concepts
that are consistent throughout,


120
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,770 line:-2
and we'll show you
how you can use just a few APIs


121
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,873 line:-1
to provide a lot of value to people.


122
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,877 line:-2
So, without further ado,
check out the next video,


123
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:53,680 line:-2
where my colleague JP
will talk about the opportunity at hand.


124
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,816 line:-1
Thanks for watching.
