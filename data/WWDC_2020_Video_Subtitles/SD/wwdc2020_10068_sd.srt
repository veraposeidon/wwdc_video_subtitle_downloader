00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,173 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:11,445 line:0
Hello and welcome to
"What's New in SiriKit and Shortcuts."


3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,915 line:0
My name is Daniel Hsu,
and I'm an engineer on the Shortcuts team.


4
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,619 line:-2
Today, I'm excited to be joined
by my colleague, Natalia,


5
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,288 line:-2
to tell you about
the latest updates to Shortcuts.


6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,724 line:-1
SiriKit is our suite of developer APIs


7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,827 line:-2
for bringing enriched Siri
and shortcut support into your app.


8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:31,131 line:-2
It's a great way to make the things people
do with your apps easier to accomplish


9
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,600 line:-2
by surfacing them
outside of the boundaries of your app


10
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,702 line:-2
and letting them out
into the operating system.


11
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,372 line:-1
This enables several key experiences.


12
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,242 line:-2
Users can perform these actions
with their voice,


13
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,579 line:-2
through suggestions that appear
on the lock screen and Spotlight,


14
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:48,282 line:-2
and of course, through shortcuts
and the Shortcuts app.


15
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:53,987 line:-2
The Shortcuts app, which comes built in
on iOS, iPadOS and watchOS,


16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,524 line:-2
is how we make it easy for people
to make using the device faster,


17
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,760 line:-1
more automatic, and more personal.


18
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,697 line:-2
Using the editor,
you can drag and drop easily


19
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:06,667 line:-2
to piece together actions
from all of your favorite apps,


20
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,903 line:-2
which can then be run
with just a single tap,


21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,407 line:-2
by asking Siri, or from many other
places in the system,


22
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,878 line:-2
like from a widget on the Home screen,
or even automatically with automations.


23
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,681 line:-2
There are practically
endless possibilities


24
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,851 line:-2
for the kinds of shortcuts you can create
and how you use them,


25
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,986 line:-1
from asking Siri to order your coffee,


26
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:29,156 line:-2
to changing the lights and temperature
in your HomeKit-enabled home


27
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:30,457 line:-1
as you're leaving work.


28
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,759 line:-1
We're putting all the power in your hands.


29
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,795 line:-1
Getting started with shortcuts


30
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,965 line:-2
can be as simple as tapping
an "Add to Siri" button,


31
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,868 line:-2
which you may have already seen
in many of your favorite apps.


32
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:46,273 line:-2
It's important for you as a developer
to make setup easy and discoverable.


33
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,076 line:-2
Make sure to include
an "Add to Siri" button


34
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,245 line:-1
in a contextually relevant place,


35
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,347 line:-1
not just in a nested settings view.


36
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,951 line:-2
That way, the people that perform
those actions in your app every day


37
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:02,289 line:-2
can set up a shortcut that makes executing
that action even faster in the future.


38
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,660 line:-2
And, they can even give it their own
personalized trigger phrase,


39
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:07,928 line:-1
like "soup time."


40
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,795 line:-1
Now that I have that set up,


41
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,300 line:-2
I can quickly reorder my favorite soup
from anywhere on my phone.


42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,636 line:-1
Siri is an intelligent assistant


43
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:19,306 line:-2
that offers a faster, easier way
to get things done with your voice.


44
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:25,612 line:-2
And this year, in iOS 14, Siri comes
with this beautiful, new, compact design.


45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,282 line:-1
We redesigned Siri from the ground up


46
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,185 line:-2
to focus only
on the most essential information,


47
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,955 line:-2
minimizing disruption, while still
allowing you to quickly get things done,


48
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,857 line:-1
no matter what you're doing on your phone.


49
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,593 line:-2
Your Siri UI should really feel
like an extension,


50
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,563 line:-2
both functionally and aesthetically,
of your app.


51
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,732 line:-2
To illustrate, let's take a look
at the Weather app.


52
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,436 line:-2
Checking the weather in the Weather app
is the complete experience.


53
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,504 line:-1
At a glance,


54
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,006 line:-2
you're able to see the weather
for all of your favorite cities,


55
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:56,276 line:-2
and you can drill down into
a specific city to see more details,


56
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,347 line:-2
like air quality,
sunrise and sunset times, and much more.


57
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:07,120 line:-2
In iOS 13, asking Siri for the weather
shows you the current forecast,


58
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,691 line:-2
the upcoming hourly forecast,
and a few other details.


59
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,763 line:-2
Updating this experience
for the compact UI in iOS 14


60
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,700 line:-2
was an exercise
in choosing the most essential things.


61
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,969 line:-1
In the new compact UI,


62
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,772 line:-2
we focused on just the most succinct
and helpful answer possible.


63
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,643 line:-2
This meant eliminating things
that weren't directly relevant.


64
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:33,413 line:-2
But this doesn't mean minimalism
for minimalism's sake.


65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,817 line:-2
It's really about getting to the heart
of what the user intention is.


66
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:41,455 line:-2
Now, in iOS 14, if you ask
for the weather, you'll get exactly that.


67
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,595 line:-2
In iOS 14, we brought the same great
compact UI experience over to Shortcuts.


68
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,933 line:-2
If your shortcut needs input from you,
a new compact UI will appear.


69
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:58,172 line:-2
This works for entering text,
numbers, dates and more.


70
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:03,744 line:-2
You can even compose messages and emails,
pick a photo, or choose a song.


71
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,116 line:-2
We also extended the same UI treatment
everywhere you can run a shortcut.


72
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:13,153 line:-2
Before, you may have needed to jump into
the Shortcuts app to complete a task.


73
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,089 line:-2
Now your shortcuts will run seamlessly
in the background,


74
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:19,293 line:-2
and will only prompt you
if the shortcut needs input from you.


75
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,195 line:-1
This makes a lot of sense,


76
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,497 line:-2
because after all,
shortcuts has always been about


77
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,999 line:-2
getting the user
to what they want to do even faster.


78
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,634 line:-1
We want to help you understand


79
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,971 line:-2
how to apply this new design principle
in your intents.


80
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,841 line:-2
There are a few cases
you should be aware of.


81
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,543 line:-1
The first is disambiguation,


82
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,880 line:-2
when you're asking follow-up questions
to clarify the user's intent.


83
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,850 line:-1
The second is Intents UI,


84
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,320 line:-2
which is how your app UI
shows in Siri and Shortcuts.


85
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,256 line:-1
Let's talk about disambiguation.


86
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,692 line:-1
With conversational shortcuts,


87
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,494 line:-2
you have the opportunity
to ask follow-up questions.


88
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,098 line:-2
If you're taking advantage of this
for your intents,


89
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:02,603 line:-2
you should consider adopting the new APIs
for customizing how the list is presented.


90
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,842 line:-2
New in iOS 14, you have the option to add
images and subtitles to your option list.


91
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,413 line:-2
This can help people visually
differentiate between similar options,


92
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,250 line:-2
which can be important, for example,
when ordering soup.


93
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,720 line:-2
But use these judiciously,
and use your best judgment.


94
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:23,123 line:-2
Imagery can help someone
make the right choice,


95
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,225 line:-2
but it can also end up
feeling overwhelming


96
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,427 line:-1
with too much information onscreen.


97
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,597 line:-1
Now, let's talk about Intents UI.


98
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:35,202 line:-2
Your Intents UI now appears
in this new compact UI,


99
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,704 line:-2
whether you're running from Siri
or Shortcuts.


100
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,276 line:-2
When designing your Intents UI
for this new environment,


101
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,678 line:-2
consider what your intent
is supposed to do,


102
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,881 line:-2
and what is actually important to show
when using it.


103
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,820 line:-2
Because the compact UI appears
on top of whatever the user is doing,


104
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,057 line:-2
the less vertical space
your Intents UI takes up,


105
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,893 line:-2
the more lightweight
the experience will feel.


106
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,897 line:-2
Consider providing a shorter snippet
where possible,


107
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:07,234 line:-2
to minimize disruption
to the user's current context.


108
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,906 line:-2
In order to help the snippet UI defer
to the context it's being presented in,


109
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:16,610 line:-2
Intents UIs now use
a consistent background material


110
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,546 line:-2
whether they're run from Siri
or from Shortcuts.


111
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:24,218 line:-2
If you'd like, you can take advantage
of the new material


112
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:28,422 line:-2
by keeping the background color
of your Intents UI view transparent.


113
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,693 line:-2
If you do choose to use
a transparent background material,


114
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,796 line:-2
make sure to test your UI
on a variety of different backgrounds


115
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,231 line:-1
to ensure readability.


116
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,368 line:-2
In summary, choosing the essential
is a key principle


117
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,537 line:-1
for designing for the new compact UI.


118
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,973 line:-1
We can't wait to see what you build.


119
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,776 line:-2
That's the new Siri
and Shortcuts experience in iOS 14.


120
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:53,814 line:-2
Now over to my colleague, Natalia,
for more exciting updates to shortcuts.


121
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,619 line:-2
When Shortcuts became an built-in app
in iOS 13,


122
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,954 line:-1
it gained a whole new audience.


123
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:06,426 line:-2
From people using simple shortcuts
to set a laundry timer or calculate a tip,


124
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,796 line:-1
to power users with hundreds of shortcuts.


125
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,701 line:-2
Shortcuts allow people
to find new, creative ways


126
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,137 line:-1
of interacting with your apps.


127
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,106 line:-1
And in iOS 14,


128
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:24,745 line:-2
we're making it easier to organize
shortcuts by introducing folders.


129
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:29,516 line:-2
With new ways
to create and manage shortcuts,


130
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:34,054 line:-2
people will find and keep track
of shortcuts from your apps faster.


131
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,991 line:-2
To get started,
there are a few smart folders


132
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:42,563 line:-2
that help people easily identify
which shortcuts appear in the share sheet


133
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,665 line:-1
or on the watch.


134
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:48,235 line:-2
That's right, people can now run shortcuts
on the watch


135
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,839 line:-1
with the new Shortcuts app on watchOS.


136
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:56,243 line:-2
In addition to running shortcuts
from within the app,


137
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,313 line:-1
people can set shortcuts as complications


138
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,349 line:-1
and run them right from the watch face.


139
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:07,187 line:-2
That means that you can bring
the functionality of your apps


140
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:10,557 line:-1
to the watch face just by using Shortcuts.


141
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:15,128 line:-2
The watch app works seamlessly
with Shortcuts on iOS.


142
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:19,499 line:-2
People can add or remove shortcuts
available on the watch


143
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:23,437 line:-2
with the new Apple Watch switch
in Shortcut details.


144
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:29,776 line:0
To learn more about how to make
your shortcuts work great on the watch,


145
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,078 line:0
check out the session,


146
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:35,115 line:0
"Create quick interactions
with Shortcuts on watchOS."


147
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,253 line:-2
Now sometimes,
people want shortcuts to run automatically


148
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:42,655 line:-2
on their behalf
when certain conditions are met.


149
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:47,761 line:-2
And for this, in iOS 13,
we introduced Personal Automations.


150
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:52,399 line:-2
Personal Automations let people
run actions based on events,


151
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,402 line:-2
such as time of day,
arrival at a location,


152
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,538 line:-1
or the opening of an app.


153
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,707 line:-2
People already build routines
around your apps,


154
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:04,077 line:-2
and automations allow them
to do it faster.


155
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,479 line:-1
For example,


156
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,315 line:-2
we've seen people automate
their journaling routines


157
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,684 line:-1
with the Open App trigger.


158
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,253 line:-1
Whenever a journaling app is open,


159
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,623 line:-2
the event gets logged
in a habit-tracking app,


160
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,893 line:-2
the device is put
into Do Not Disturb mode,


161
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,564 line:-2
and a focused writing playlist
starts playing.


162
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,033 line:-1
This is just one example.


163
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,570 line:-2
There's so much more
people are doing with automations.


164
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:34,141 line:-2
And in iOS 14,
we're taking automations even further


165
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,476 line:-1
by introducing new trigger types.


166
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:43,250 line:-2
People will now be able to run shortcuts
when they receive an email or a message,


167
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,319 line:-1
when they close a certain app,


168
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:48,288 line:0
when their battery hits a certain level,


169
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,657 line:-1
or when they connect to a charger.


170
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:56,797 line:-2
And more trigger types can now run
automatically without asking people first.


171
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,569 line:-2
A great place to find inspiration
for shortcuts is the gallery,


172
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:07,808 line:-2
and in iOS 14, we've added
automation suggestions to the gallery.


173
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:12,012 line:-2
They provide catered automations
that people may find handy


174
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,947 line:-1
based on how they use their device.


175
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:18,585 line:-2
Your actions are the key
to great automations.


176
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:24,791 line:-2
To learn more about enabling people to
interact with your app through shortcuts,


177
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:28,629 line:0
watch the video on featuring your actions
in the Shortcuts app.


178
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,265 line:-1
As you can see,


179
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:35,869 line:-2
shortcuts are great for taking
the guesswork out of everyday tasks.


180
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:41,308 line:-2
No matter how complex your routine is,
you can easily automate it with shortcuts.


181
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,610 line:-1
Our routines may differ,


182
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:48,048 line:-2
but one thing we all have in common
is our need for a good night's sleep.


183
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:54,388 line:-2
So this year, we're enabling developers
to help people manage their sleep routine.


184
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:59,193 line:-2
If your app involves mindfulness,
journaling, music,


185
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,663 line:-2
or any of the other
supported sleep categories,


186
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:07,100 line:-2
your action can be featured
in the Wind Down setup experience.


187
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:12,172 line:-2
All you need to do is mark
your shortcut donations as good for sleep


188
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:16,643 line:-2
with the new
INShortcutAvailabilityOptions API.


189
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,913 line:0
If your app is even remotely
sleep-friendly,


190
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,685 line:0
make sure to watch the session
on integrating your app with Wind Down.


191
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:29,223 line:-2
This year, we have so many
exciting improvements to SiriKit


192
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,692 line:-1
that we have a separate SiriKit session.


193
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,760 line:0
We encourage you to check out


194
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:37,631 line:0
"Get the most out of Siri,
Shortcuts and SiriKit"


195
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,266 line:0
to learn all the details.


196
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,706 line:-2
There are a lot of new features
in SiriKit and Shortcuts in iOS 14.


197
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:50,711 line:-2
We're introducing a brand-new
shortcut-running experience and folders.


198
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:55,649 line:-2
We're bringing the Shortcuts app
to the Apple Watch.


199
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,921 line:-2
For automation, we're adding
automation suggestions to the gallery,


200
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:02,923 line:-1
and providing more triggers.


201
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:08,228 line:-2
And finally, we're supporting
the new Wind Down experience.


202
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:11,932 line:-2
There's even more that we didn't get
to talk about in detail.


203
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:16,570 line:-2
To dive deeper into what's new
in SiriKit and Shortcuts,


204
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:19,907 line:-2
make sure to watch the sessions
linked to this video.


205
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:21,575 line:-1
Thank you for watching.
