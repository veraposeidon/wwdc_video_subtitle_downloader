00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,573 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:13,313 line:0
Hi, my name is Radhika, and I work on the
Proactive Intelligence team here at Apple.


4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,949 line:-2
As JP just mentioned
in the previous video,


5
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,418 line:-2
it's clear that
the intelligent system experience


6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,255 line:-1
provides a lot of value for the developer.


7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,557 line:-2
Now, we'll look
at how this benefits users.


8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,727 line:-2
To do this, let's walk
through how system intelligence


9
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:30,297 line:-2
can actually help people,
even before they download an app,


10
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,400 line:-2
and how it can help
through every step of the way


11
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,903 line:-2
from someone
who's just starting to use an app


12
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,704 line:-1
to becoming a power user.


13
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,041 line:-2
To illustrate this,
we'll use something relatable,


14
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:44,011 line:-2
like breaking up the workweek
by doing some exercise.


15
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,514 line:-2
I'll tell this story from the perspective
of someone that's just starting to learn


16
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,484 line:-2
how to take advantage
of all the cool stuff on their phone.


17
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,620 line:-2
Let's say this person
always works out with a friend.


18
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,455 line:-1
That friend might text them


19
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,125 line:-2
with the address
of a new gym they're going to today.


20
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,828 line:0
And before they even
type the address in Maps,


21
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,098 line:0
there's a suggestion
to get driving directions to that gym


22
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,035 line:0
that's just a tap away
right there in Maps.


23
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,971 line:0
So again, no gym app installed yet,


24
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:15,242 line:0
but Maps is smart enough to pick up
on the location of the gym from Messages.


25
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,443 line:0
Pretty cool, right?


26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,479 line:-2
Let's say she arrives with her friend
at this gym


27
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,583 line:-2
and they decide they want to do
a workout class together.


28
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,352 line:-2
They don't really know
what classes are available at this gym,


29
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,721 line:-2
so they're looking
for the gym's class schedule.


30
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,791 line:-2
Starting with iOS 14,
there'll be an App Clip for that.


31
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,494 line:-2
She could walk past
the same reception desk every day,


32
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,465 line:-2
but this time, there could be an NFC tag
for an App Clip at the register.


33
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,268 line:-2
By just holding her phone
close to the tag,


34
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:44,705 line:-2
she could see the schedule
just like it would appear in the gym's app


35
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,441 line:-2
but without needing to hunt down
and download something.


36
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:52,012 line:0
What's really cool is that if she finds
this particular App Clip useful,


37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,148 line:0
there's a way to download
the full app right there.


38
00:01:56,383 --> 00:02:00,153 line:-2
Now, this imaginary gym rat has gone
from going to the gym without an app


39
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,257 line:-2
to realizing how the App Clip
can help her plan out her week.


40
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:07,594 line:-2
In fact, she might want to start picking
the day she wants to go to the gym


41
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,596 line:-1
based on what classes are scheduled.


42
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,499 line:-1
So, she ends up downloading the app.


43
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,368 line:-1
Now, she's starting to plan ahead.


44
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,337 line:-2
Discovering this app
helped her solve a problem


45
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,072 line:-1
she didn't even know she had.


46
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,576 line:-2
Our new app user
is now being far more proactive


47
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,846 line:-2
in building healthy habits
and creating an intentional schedule.


48
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,415 line:-2
She's started planning out her week
on Sunday mornings,


49
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,450 line:-1
which is a very responsible thing to do.


50
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,321 line:-2
In fact, she's gotten even faster
at opening her apps


51
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,223 line:-1
by pulling down to reveal Search.


52
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,861 line:-2
And lo and behold, when she pulls down,
even before she starts typing,


53
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,798 line:-2
the app is waiting for her
right there in Siri Suggestions.


54
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,135 line:-2
That's because Siri
can actually learn and predict


55
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:51,572 line:-2
what app she wants to launch
based on how she uses her phone.


56
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,274 line:-1
So, she has the app on her device,


57
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,377 line:-2
and she's starting to use
the various features within the app,


58
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:01,081 line:-2
like looking at the yoga schedule
and finding new classes she can try out.


59
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,517 line:-1
She's pretty familiar with the app,


60
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,186 line:-2
and can get to the information she needs
most of the time.


61
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,655 line:-1
She's really into yoga.


62
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,757 line:-1
So even though she has her week planned,


63
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:14,027 line:-2
she's always trying to squeeze in
an extra yoga class.


64
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:17,598 line:-2
She usually checks the yoga schedule
after work by going into the app,


65
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,201 line:-2
but recently, she's been using
the timely shortcut suggestions.


66
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:26,240 line:-2
She can jump right to the yoga schedule
by tapping on it in Search.


67
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,543 line:-2
It ends up saving her a couple of steps,
and most importantly,


68
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,979 line:-2
she can probably get in
some extra yoga time.


69
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,049 line:-2
So, our friend is now
pretty accustomed with the app


70
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,318 line:-1
and is really loving her new gym routine.


71
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,654 line:-1
There have been some hiccups, though,


72
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,991 line:-2
so she's looking for ways
to make things even easier for herself.


73
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,027 line:0
She ended up missing
a group class recently


74
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,429 line:0
because she didn't notice
a schedule update.


75
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:53,267 line:0
With a busy workweek, she didn't end up
checking the app frequently enough.


76
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,436 line:-1
Luckily, this year, with the new widgets,


77
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:00,274 line:-2
there's an intelligent experience
available right on her Home Screen.


78
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,409 line:-1
With a few quick taps,


79
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:05,345 line:-2
she can create a Smart Stack
with all her favorite widgets,


80
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,448 line:-2
including Mission Gym,
and add it to her Home Screen.


81
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:13,053 line:-2
Thanks to system intelligence,
the stack will rotate automatically


82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,423 line:-2
to show the most relevant
and timely widget.


83
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,760 line:-2
So, in her case,
if the class schedule changes,


84
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,796 line:-2
the stack will automatically rotate
to the gym widget,


85
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,899 line:-2
giving her enough time
to react to any changes.


86
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,101 line:-1
This way she'll never miss a class.


87
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,170 line:-1
More importantly, in the future,


88
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:33,273 line:-2
she can browse upcoming class times
directly on her Home Screen


89
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,810 line:-2
by glancing at the widget
and picking a time that works for her.


90
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,512 line:-1
If she wants to learn more,


91
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,182 line:-2
she can always tap on the widget
to jump to the right place in the app.


92
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,552 line:-2
So instead of looking for the app
and then navigating through it,


93
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,288 line:-2
she can find everything
right on her Home Screen.


94
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,192 line:-2
Our friend has been working out
pretty frequently now.


95
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,829 line:-2
She did notice, however,
she has been repeating the same few things


96
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,531 line:-1
right before she works out.


97
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:00,801 line:-2
She always checks the bus schedule
before starting the workout,


98
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,837 line:-2
and she uses the Mission Gym app
to track her exercise.


99
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,874 line:-2
This is where Shortcuts
is bound to come in handy.


100
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,645 line:-2
She can set up a Shortcut automation
that will run when she arrives at the gym.


101
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:12,980 line:-1
So when she gets there,


102
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,083 line:-2
she can see the bus schedule
and start her workout.


103
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,386 line:-2
So, as you can see
through this user's journey,


104
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:22,589 line:-2
system intelligence
can help people discover new apps


105
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,959 line:-2
and accelerate them every step of the way
after that.


106
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,897 line:-2
By leveraging
these intelligence touch points,


107
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,665 line:-1
you can work with the system


108
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:35,035 line:-2
to deliver better,
more holistic experience for your users


109
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,237 line:-1
at the right time and place.


110
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,773 line:-2
Now, I'm going to hand it over
to my colleague Sufiyan


111
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,942 line:-2
who will talk about
the underlying technologies


112
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,311 line:-1
that power all of these experiences.


113
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,380 line:-1
