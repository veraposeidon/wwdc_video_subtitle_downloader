00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,340 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:10,811 line:0
Hi, and welcome to our session
on iPad app design.


3
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:13,814 line:0
I'm Grant Paul from the Apple Design Team.


4
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,884 line:0
Today, we want to show you
some of the new features and changes


5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,220 line:0
in iPadOS 14,
what those mean for your apps,


6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:24,057 line:0
as well as some general tips
on how you can make a great iPad app.


7
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:29,229 line:-2
With technologies like Auto Layout,
Mac Catalyst and Universal Purchases,


8
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:33,667 line:-2
many apps are continuing to expand
to more devices and more platforms.


9
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,702 line:-1
People are getting more opportunity


10
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,072 line:-2
to use their favorite apps
on all of their favorite devices


11
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,308 line:-1
wherever it's most convenient for them.


12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,945 line:-1
And for us as designers and as developers,


13
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:48,882 line:-2
this means we need to focus in
on what's best for each platform


14
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:52,186 line:-2
to make sure
that every device and every platform


15
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,521 line:-1
is creating a great experience.


16
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,291 line:-1
So, on the one end, you have the Mac.


17
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:01,628 line:-2
The Mac has the biggest screens,
it has the most precise input methods,


18
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:05,899 line:-2
and Mac OS apps are there to support
all of the most advanced use cases


19
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,402 line:-2
while still staying
accessible to everyone.


20
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,038 line:-1
On the other side, you have the iPhone.


21
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,341 line:-2
iPhone apps are all about
getting quick and easy access


22
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:18,011 line:-2
to the most important functionality
while you're on the go,


23
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,580 line:-1
and all through Multi-Touch.


24
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,851 line:-2
So for both of these, the design direction
for your apps is pretty clear.


25
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,086 line:-1
But what about the iPad?


26
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,188 line:-1
Just because the iPad is in the middle,


27
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,725 line:-2
that doesn't mean it's just
halfway between the Mac and the iPhone.


28
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,762 line:-2
A great iPad app, it needs to be
just as dedicated to what's unique,


29
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,031 line:-1
to what's great and special about the iPad


30
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,336 line:-2
as apps are about what's unique and great
about the iPhone and the Mac.


31
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,905 line:-2
And that's what
we're going to talk about today.


32
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,040 line:-2
We're going to show you
some design principles


33
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,410 line:-1
that we applied in our apps for iPadOS 14,


34
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,479 line:-2
and we're going to talk about
how you can use


35
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:55,182 line:-1
those same principles in your own apps.


36
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,519 line:-2
So first, we're going to talk about
updating your app's layout


37
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,722 line:-2
to take full advantage
of the iPad's large display.


38
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,424 line:-1
After that, we're going to cover


39
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,561 line:-2
how to best support
all of the different inputs on the iPad.


40
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,298 line:-2
Then, I'll hand it over to Vince Lane
to talk in detail


41
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:15,269 line:-2
about some of the new UI components
in iPadOS this year.


42
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:19,273 line:-2
Things like our new Split Views
and the great new Sidebar navigation.


43
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:23,877 line:-2
And finally, we'll cover some changes
in how to use toolbars


44
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,079 line:-1
to position your buttons and your actions.


45
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,750 line:-2
So the most important,
the most prominent feature of the iPad


46
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,152 line:-1
is of course its big display.


47
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,921 line:-1
So, if you're making an iPad app,


48
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,990 line:-2
your first step should be
to take advantage of the display


49
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,927 line:-2
to show your content
and your user interface


50
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,662 line:-1
in the best possible light.


51
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,866 line:-2
So, let's look at a few examples
from our own apps of how you can do that.


52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,535 line:-2
The first technique
that I'm going to talk about


53
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,737 line:-1
is to flatten your app's navigation.


54
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,640 line:-1
Avoid big full-screen transitions


55
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,443 line:-2
in favor of updating
part of the screen at a time.


56
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,445 line:-1
Let's look at an example of that.


57
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:02,583 line:-2
So, here's part of the Photos app
from iOS 13.


58
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:06,386 line:-2
You can choose an album or a media type
like your Portrait mode photos,


59
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:10,224 line:-2
and it'll slide over the entire screen
to show that content.


60
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,127 line:-2
It's simple, it's familiar,
and it works great on the iPhone.


61
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,166 line:-2
And on the iPad, we had brought over
the same familiar navigation structure


62
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,335 line:-1
with full-screen transitions.


63
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,569 line:-1
But on the iPad,


64
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:26,373 line:-2
that ends up leaving a lot of empty space
on the right side of the screen.


65
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,242 line:-1
So, on iPadOS 14,


66
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:32,379 line:-2
we've updated the Photos app
to use our new Sidebar navigation.


67
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,482 line:-2
So instead of empty space,
it fills the display


68
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,085 line:-2
with the content that you want to see,
your photos,


69
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,587 line:-2
as well as your navigation controls
on the left.


70
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,357 line:-2
It's using that space
to show you something useful.


71
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,760 line:-2
But showing content
along with your navigation


72
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,595 line:-1
also helps in other ways too.


73
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,733 line:-2
For example, if you want to switch between
different parts of your photo library,


74
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,304 line:-2
to your albums or to all of your photos,
it's now just a single tap away.


75
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,707 line:-2
And it speeds up features
like Drag and Drop


76
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:04,178 line:-2
since the drop targets, the albums
that you want to drop your photos into,


77
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,414 line:-2
are already visible on the screen
as soon as you start dragging.


78
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,350 line:-2
Now, the next principle
that I want to talk about


79
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,252 line:-1
is showing more content.


80
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,154 line:-1
Now, this one is a pretty simple idea.


81
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,290 line:-1
You've got a bigger screen on the iPad,


82
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,892 line:-2
so you need more content
in order to fill that up.


83
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,329 line:-2
But getting that right,
it takes some intentional design choices.


84
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:26,967 line:-2
So, back in iOS 12, here's what
the Home Screen looked like on the iPad.


85
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,803 line:-2
You can see all the icons
are relatively far away from each other.


86
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,405 line:-1
They're pretty spaced out.


87
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:36,109 line:-2
In iPadOS 13, we added
an extra row and column of icons,


88
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,913 line:-2
and now, in iPad iOS 14,
we've added in our new widgets.


89
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,283 line:-2
So, the icons are still pretty big
and you can see more of them at once.


90
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,786 line:-1
It's using the space in a better way.


91
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,187 line:-1
Here's another example:


92
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,857 line:-1
This is the Files app from iPadOS 13.


93
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,024 line:-1
Now, this one is interesting


94
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:54,795 line:-2
because the files are filling up
the entire right side of the screen.


95
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:58,098 line:-2
There's no gaps between them,
and there's no big empty space.


96
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,402 line:-2
But if you look,
it's only showing 12 icons at a time,


97
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,371 line:-1
and we thought we could do better.


98
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:10,611 line:-2
So, in iPadOS 14, Files now uses
significantly smaller icons.


99
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:14,781 line:-2
Now, these icons are still plenty
big enough to see, to read, and to tap on,


100
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,483 line:-1
so the app is just as usable,


101
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,853 line:-2
but it's a great example
of how small tweaks to density


102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,557 line:-2
can make your app feel
so much more efficient, and more powerful,


103
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:26,627 line:-2
just by making better use
of the available screen space.


104
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,830 line:-1
Now this new layout here


105
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:33,667 line:-2
means that Files is showing
almost 300% as many icons.


106
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,068 line:-1
Can you believe that?


107
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,937 line:-1
As long as your text is readable,


108
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,340 line:-2
you should see if you can show
more on screen in your apps too.


109
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,209 line:-1
So, that was showing more content.


110
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,345 line:-2
Now, our next technique
is adding more context.


111
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:49,917 line:-2
Now in iPhone apps, you're often
gonna focus in on a specific thing


112
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:54,254 line:-2
because there's only so much room
to show things on the small screen.


113
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:58,992 line:-2
But on an iPad, you have room to do more,
to show more than one thing at a time.


114
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,827 line:-1
Let's see where that can apply.


115
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,698 line:-1
In iPadOS 13, this is what it looked like


116
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,234 line:-1
when you renamed a file in the Files app.


117
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:10,838 line:-2
It's focused. You're not seeing anything
else but the file you're renaming,


118
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,074 line:-2
but you're losing all of the context
of the files below.


119
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:19,179 line:-2
In iPadOS 14,
we've brought file renaming in-line.


120
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,052 line:-2
By staying in context, this lets
the rest of the screen stay useful


121
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,654 line:-2
even while you're renaming
a specific file.


122
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,957 line:-2
You can use the other file names
in the folder,


123
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,826 line:-2
for example, as a reference
for the name that you're typing in.


124
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,463 line:-2
So, wherever you have an overlay
or you're blocking out part of the screen,


125
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,765 line:-1
see if you can keep people in context.


126
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,001 line:-2
It'll make your app feel
both lighter weight


127
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,337 line:-1
and more powerful at the same time.


128
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,640 line:-2
Another example of this
can come with popovers.


129
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,108 line:-1
Now, popovers are great


130
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,144 line:-2
when you're showing context
of where something comes from.


131
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,180 line:-2
For example, here,
when you're viewing or editing


132
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,215 line:-1
a specific event in your Calendar,


133
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,318 line:-2
the arrow on the popover
helps give you that context


134
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,354 line:-1
of where that event is in your day.


135
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,558 line:-2
But take a look at this popover
from Calendar in iPadOS 13.


136
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,261 line:-2
Now, this one came from
us directly bringing over


137
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,062 line:-1
the same screen from the iPhone.


138
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,565 line:-2
The popover is the same width
as the iPhone screen,


139
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,934 line:-1
so it's really easy to translate.


140
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,068 line:-1
But look at this popover.


141
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,704 line:-2
The arrow is just pointing
to a button called "Calendars".


142
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,440 line:-2
It's not really giving you
any useful context.


143
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,176 line:-1
So, in iPadOS 14,


144
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:26,413 line:-2
we've moved the Calendars menu
to the same level as the Calendar events.


145
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,283 line:-2
Now you can see and interact
with those Calendar events


146
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,786 line:-2
even while you're changing the visibility
of your Calendars.


147
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,756 line:-2
The results display instantly
on the right.


148
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,491 line:-1
So, take a look at your apps.


149
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,993 line:-2
See if you have any modal sheets
or popovers,


150
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,364 line:-2
and see if those modal sheets and popovers
are giving people useful context


151
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,067 line:-2
or if they're blocking
other parts of your app.


152
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,704 line:-2
See if it would work better
if your controls are at the same level,


153
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,439 line:-1
rather than an overlays.


154
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:55,309 line:-2
And of course,
if your app works on Mac OS too,


155
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,979 line:-2
avoiding models and overlays
works great there as well.


156
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:02,049 line:-2
Now, modal UIs
are used even less often on Mac OS


157
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,784 line:-1
than they are on iPadOS,


158
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,820 line:-2
because Macs have bigger screens
and larger windows.


159
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:10,457 line:-2
On the other hand,
with a compact device like an iPhone,


160
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,427 line:-2
you might not have enough room
to show multiple things at a time,


161
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,363 line:-2
and you shouldn't try and force it,
you shouldn't try and squeeze


162
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,399 line:-2
multiple pieces of UI
onto a single screen.


163
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:26,773 line:-2
modals are still a great choice to focus
in on a specific piece of content.


164
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:31,845 line:-2
Finally, I want to talk about
going deep on a specific piece of content.


165
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,182 line:-1
Some of the most magical iPad experiences


166
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:38,184 line:-2
come from when the display
becomes more than a piece of glass.


167
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,923 line:-2
When it feels like the entire device
is becoming a piece of content.


168
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,128 line:-2
This is things like turning pages in Books
or watching a video on Apple TV


169
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,564 line:-2
or sketching with the Apple Pencil
in Notes.


170
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,468 line:-2
Here's another example of that
from the Photos app.


171
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,971 line:-2
When you go in to edit a photo,
it uses a custom immersive layout


172
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,108 line:-2
that's been designed specifically
for the iPad.


173
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:04,845 line:-2
You can see all the controls are aligned
to the left and right sides of the screen


174
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:08,549 line:-2
so that they're easy to use with two hands
when you're holding your iPad.


175
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:12,586 line:-2
And on the big screen, you can both see
the photo really nice and big,


176
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:15,155 line:-2
and none of the editing controls
have to cover


177
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,357 line:-1
any part of the photo that you're editing.


178
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:21,428 line:-2
And here's another example.
This one is new in iPadOS 14.


179
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:25,532 line:-2
In Music, the Now Playing screen
takes over the entire display,


180
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:29,169 line:-2
so you can focus on the music
and the lyrics that are playing.


181
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,238 line:-1
Now compared to a Mac.


182
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:34,641 line:-2
this ability to focus in
on a single piece of content


183
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,278 line:-2
is something that's really unique
and special about the iPad.


184
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:42,216 line:-2
The software can make it feel
like the hardware almost disappears.


185
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,551 line:-1
Like it's become the piece of content.


186
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:48,255 line:-2
It leaves your app feeling like
more than the sum of its parts.


187
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,757 line:-1
So, that's how to fill the display.


188
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:54,027 line:-2
The next key part of an iPad app
is all about interaction.


189
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,631 line:-2
So, of course, the iPad
is a touch-first device,


190
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,299 line:-1
but from the very beginning,


191
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,269 line:-2
it's something that's supported
multiple kinds of inputs.


192
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:06,540 line:-2
From the keyboard, originally,
to now the Pencil and the Trackpad.


193
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,208 line:-1
And the best iPad apps


194
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:12,346 line:-2
are going to have first-class support
for all of these different inputs.


195
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,449 line:-2
They're going to use each input
for what it does best.


196
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,453 line:-2
But, of course, you always should start
with Multi-Touch.


197
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,154 line:-1
Everything in iPadOS


198
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:25,659 line:-2
is built out of big, friendly tap targets
and fast and fluid gestures.


199
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:30,197 line:-2
Your iPad apps should always start
with these touch interactions too.


200
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:33,233 line:-2
Even if you're going to support
extra inputs on top of that,


201
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,868 line:-1
you need to make sure that your app


202
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:38,272 line:-2
has a great experience with touch
before you do.


203
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,575 line:-1
Now, the next step after Multi-Touch


204
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:46,547 line:-2
is using the built-in features in iPadOS
to support all of these other inputs.


205
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:49,917 line:-2
For people who are using a Magic Keyboard
or other keyboards,


206
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,553 line:-2
you should make sure
to add keyboard shortcuts


207
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,922 line:-1
for all of the common actions in your app.


208
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,225 line:-2
There are some people who really
use a lot of keyboard shortcuts,


209
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:01,461 line:-2
and they're going to appreciate
any shortcuts that you add.


210
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,932 line:-2
But those shortcuts won't get in the way
for anyone else using your app.


211
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,601 line:-2
If you're on the fence about
whether you should add a shortcut,


212
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,770 line:-1
I would recommend that you do it.


213
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,906 line:-2
And if you bring your app to Mac OS
with Mac Catalyst,


214
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,809 line:-2
all of these shortcuts
are gonna translate over there as well,


215
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,178 line:-2
and people are gonna find them
just as useful.


216
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:22,082 line:-2
Now, along with the keyboard,
the iPad now supports the Trackpad.


217
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,452 line:-2
Most Trackpad support
is going to come automatically


218
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,090 line:-2
because all of the built-in controls
in iPadOS support the Trackpad already.


219
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:31,692 line:-1
You can also extend the pointer


220
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:35,329 line:-2
to support any kind of custom controls
or custom interactions


221
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,697 line:-1
that you want to add.


222
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,432 line:-1
So, for more information


223
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,935 line:-2
on the Trackpad behaviors
and the customizations you can make to it,


224
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,971 line:-2
I would really recommend
checking out the session,


225
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,106 line:-1
"Designing for the iPadOS Pointer."


226
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:50,711 line:-2
Finally, you should make sure
to support Scribble with the Apple Pencil.


227
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,080 line:-2
Like pointer support,
you'll get it automatically


228
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,516 line:-2
when you use
the system text input controls.


229
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,684 line:-1
But if you have custom controls,


230
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,654 line:-2
you're going to want to make sure
that Scribble is supported in them too.


231
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,356 line:-1
Because people who use Scribble


232
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,592 line:-2
are going to expect it to work
in all of the apps on their device.


233
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:09,897 line:-2
So, that's using the built-in features
from all of the inputs in iPadOS.


234
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,834 line:-2
One thing that's really special
about all of these inputs


235
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,069 line:-2
is that they can all work
at the same time.


236
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,105 line:-1
And one really unique thing you can do,


237
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:21,909 line:-2
one thing that's really special
and that can only exist on the iPad,


238
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:26,246 line:-2
is that you can combine multiple inputs
into a single interaction.


239
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:29,049 line:-2
It can make for
some really great interactions


240
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,051 line:-1
that couldn't exist anywhere else.


241
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:35,889 line:-2
One great example of that
is combining Keyboard with Touch.


242
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:39,393 line:-2
For example, in Safari,
you can open links in a new tab


243
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,528 line:-2
by holding the Command key
while tapping it,


244
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:45,032 line:-2
or hold down "Option" and tap a link
to download a file,


245
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:49,069 line:-2
or hold down "Ctrl" and tap
to get more options.


246
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:50,704 line:-1
And in your apps,


247
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:54,341 line:-2
you should support combining modifier keys
with all of the inputs,


248
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,410 line:-1
like Touch and Trackpad.


249
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,846 line:-1
You can support standard system behaviors,


250
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,747 line:-2
things like holding "Option"
and dragging an item


251
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,216 line:-1
in order to make a copy


252
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,552 line:-2
or holding "Shift" and tapping items
to select them as a group.


253
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:09,723 line:-2
Another great combination of inputs
is Pencil and Touch.


254
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,960 line:-1
Here's the great animation app Loom.


255
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,262 line:-1
So, Loom combines Pencil and Touch input


256
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:18,031 line:-2
to make it really fast
to sketch out frames.


257
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,335 line:-2
On the left, you can use this dial
with Touch


258
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,605 line:-2
to select which frame it is
that you're drawing the animation for.


259
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,039 line:-1
Then, on the right side of the screen,


260
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:30,010 line:-2
I can use the Apple Pencil
to draw the actual frame of the animation.


261
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,980 line:-2
So, I can switch between a frame
and then draw the next one.


262
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,120 line:-2
You can see how fast it is
to draw a cool animation


263
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:43,323 line:-2
by combining both Touch input
and the Apple Pencil


264
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,591 line:-1
for a great interaction.


265
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:52,299 line:-2
So those are some ways that you can make
your app's input more powerful.


266
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:57,070 line:-2
The last technique I want to talk about
is making your app feel fast,


267
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,607 line:-2
and one really key way
to make your app feel fast


268
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,976 line:-2
is to make sure
that it's always responsive.


269
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,779 line:-2
No matter what else is going on
on the screen,


270
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:10,217 line:-2
animations or transitions or processing,
it should always be responsive


271
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,587 line:-2
It means responding to input
all of the time.


272
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:17,558 line:-2
Here's an example of that
in the new drop-down menus in iPadOS 14.


273
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:20,093 line:-2
You can scrub to the item you want
in a single gesture,


274
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,529 line:-1
even while the menu is animating up.


275
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,800 line:-2
Imagine that if you had to tap,
wait for the menu to finish appearing,


276
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,836 line:-1
and then tap an item to select it.


277
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,103 line:-1
It would feel so much slower.


278
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,172 line:-2
It would feel like
the device is not working


279
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,208 line:-1
as fast as you can think about it.


280
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,176 line:-1
Let's look at another example.


281
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,345 line:-1
So when you bring up a drop-down menu,


282
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:40,881 line:-2
tapping outside of that menu
has to dismiss it,


283
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:44,017 line:-2
so it can't pass that touch through
to the app below.


284
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,620 line:-2
But other gestures
don't necessarily conflict.


285
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:52,226 line:-2
So in iPadOS 14, you can start scrolling
outside of a menu to instantly dismiss it


286
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,829 line:-2
and scroll the content underneath
with a single gesture.


287
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,166 line:-2
The app is staying as responsive
as it possibly can.


288
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,369 line:-2
Now these kind of micro-interactions,
they can feel small.


289
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:05,339 line:-2
But when you get them right,
it really adds up.


290
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,475 line:-2
People can build confidence
that no matter where they are in your app,


291
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:09,843 line:-1
when they interact with the screen,


292
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,614 line:-2
when they go out of their way
to touch the screen or use the Trackpad,


293
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,217 line:-2
that the app is going to respond
to the input that they're giving it.


294
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:21,154 line:-2
You know, sometimes people complain
that animations feel too slow


295
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:25,292 line:-2
or the transitions are taking too long,
and they have to wait for them to finish.


296
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,761 line:-1
But when your app is always responsive,


297
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:30,497 line:-2
these animations
can help give people context


298
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:32,132 line:-1
rather than getting in the way,


299
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,869 line:-2
because they can always interact
with your app at any time.


300
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:39,273 line:-2
Now I'm gonna hand it over to Vince
to talk about sidebars.


301
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,974 line:-1
Thanks, Grant.


302
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,643 line:-1
To optimize iPad layouts,


303
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,180 line:-2
one of the key new features in iPadOS 14
is the sidebar.


304
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:49,716 line:-2
Let's take a look at some of
the new features built into the sidebar


305
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:53,554 line:-2
and then later we'll discuss strategies
for implementing a sidebar in your app.


306
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,390 line:-1
Now, this is Home in iPadOS 13.


307
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,425 line:-2
And if we take a closer look
at the tab bar,


308
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:01,261 line:-2
you'll notice
a lot of empty horizontal space.


309
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:05,299 line:-2
It's not a great use
of this beautiful 12.9-inch display,


310
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,468 line:-2
and navigating to a specific room
takes a few steps.


311
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,672 line:-2
To get there,
you have to tap the Rooms tab,


312
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:15,709 line:-2
then open the Rooms popover,
then find the room you're looking for,


313
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:18,145 line:-1
and then, finally, hit the switch.


314
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:19,446 line:-1
It's a little cumbersome,


315
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:22,583 line:-2
especially if you're in the dark
trying to turn on the lights.


316
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,319 line:-1
Now this is Home in iPadOS 14,


317
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:28,021 line:-2
featuring the new sidebar
in place of the tab bar.


318
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,891 line:-2
It's a much better use
of this large display.


319
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,061 line:-2
You can now jump to any room in the house
with a single tap.


320
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,366 line:-2
You can also easily rearrange rooms
by simply dragging and dropping.


321
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,869 line:-2
Okay, let's see
some more sidebar examples.


322
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,705 line:-2
The team's added a sidebar
to Music as well.


323
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:48,208 line:-2
It allows for much quicker navigation
to your entire library.


324
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:51,245 line:-1
And in Files, the new iPadOS 14 sidebar


325
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:54,081 line:-2
makes navigation and customization
simpler than ever.


326
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,617 line:-1
The new sidebar supports Edit mode,


327
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:01,154 line:-2
making it easy to show, hide,
and rearrange content.


328
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:04,858 line:-2
You can also easily create shortcuts
to your most important content


329
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,994 line:-2
by dragging and dropping items
onto the sidebar.


330
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,396 line:-1
And it makes it really easy


331
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:12,598 line:-2
for people to dial in
the sidebar's content to their needs.


332
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,368 line:-2
The sidebar even supports
spring-loaded folders,


333
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:19,173 line:-2
so you can rearrange content
with a single finger.


334
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:23,844 line:-2
We've added the sidebar to Photos as well,
making navigation simple and fast.


335
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:26,747 line:-2
Content is organized
into collapsible groups.


336
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:31,785 line:-2
You can collapse media types, for example,
to quickly jump to the other albums below.


337
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:35,856 line:-2
And if you tap the sidebar toggle button
at the top,


338
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:37,624 line:-1
the sidebar tucks away,


339
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:40,894 line:-2
allowing your photos to fill
the full width of the screen.


340
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,664 line:-2
To bring it back,
just swipe from the left edge.


341
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:48,302 line:-2
Swiping from the left edge lets you
pull in the sidebar as an overlay,


342
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:52,940 line:-2
and using the sidebar as an overlay
is great for fast, fluid interactions.


343
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:55,542 line:-2
It means the sidebar is always there
when you need it,


344
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,512 line:-2
but as soon as you start interacting
with the content area,


345
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,782 line:-2
it re-hides,
so you can get right back to your photos.


346
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:04,952 line:-2
And of course, if you don't want
the sidebar automatically hiding,


347
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,588 line:-1
just tap the sidebar toggle button again


348
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,790 line:-2
to bring it back
without the overlay behavior.


349
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,759 line:-1
Now let's see how things work in Portrait.


350
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,597 line:-2
The sidebar automatically switches
to overlay in Portrait,


351
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:20,467 line:-2
and this is to ensure
enough horizontal space for your content.


352
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,804 line:-2
But again, you can easily
bring it back into view anytime


353
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,106 line:-1
with a tap, or a swipe from the left edge.


354
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,977 line:-2
It works the same way
when you're multitasking on iPad.


355
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:32,112 line:-1
With a split view like this one,


356
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,249 line:-2
there isn't enough room for the sidebar
and your content,


357
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,818 line:-2
so the sidebar switches
to overlay presentation.


358
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,820 line:-1
Now let's take a look at Mail.


359
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:41,955 line:-1
One of the great things about Mail on iPad


360
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:44,525 line:-1
is that it supports three-column layouts.


361
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,960 line:-2
It's super useful
for visualizing the hierarchy


362
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:49,363 line:-1
of your mailboxes and messages.


363
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,265 line:-1
But in iPadOS 13,


364
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,534 line:-2
these three-column layouts
were only available


365
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,669 line:-1
on our largest iPad Pro devices.


366
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:59,173 line:-2
Smaller iPads were limited
to two-column layouts.


367
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,309 line:-2
Well, the new iPadOS 14 sidebar
changes that.


368
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:06,079 line:-2
We're bringing three-column layouts
to all iPads.


369
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,650 line:-2
Just swipe from the left edge
to bring in the third column.


370
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:13,153 line:-2
You can now see your mailboxes
and messages side by side.


371
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,688 line:-1
Once you're done with the sidebar,


372
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:17,291 line:-2
the layout collapses back down
to two columns


373
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,859 line:-1
to make room for your content.


374
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,595 line:-1
Three-column layouts even work


375
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:24,131 line:-2
when the sidebar is presented
as an overlay.


376
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:28,602 line:-2
Again, just swipe from the left edge
to bring in the sidebar.


377
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,071 line:-2
And if you need to get
to that third column,


378
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:33,707 line:-1
just keep on pulling, and there it is.


379
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:35,075 line:-1
It really comes in handy,


380
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:38,512 line:-2
and now it's available
on all iPads running iPadOS 14.


381
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:42,382 line:-2
The sidebars you build in iPadOS
convert into sidebars on Mac OS,


382
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,919 line:-2
so they're perfect for creating
the navigational structure


383
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:47,921 line:-1
of your Catalyst app, too.


384
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:50,858 line:-1
That's the all-new iPadOS 14 sidebar.


385
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:54,294 line:-2
Let's recap the features
of the new sidebar.


386
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,831 line:-2
It provides app layouts
optimized for iPad.


387
00:19:57,898 --> 00:20:00,934 line:-2
It supports both modal
and non-modal editing


388
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:04,338 line:-2
so that your users can quickly navigate
to what's most important to them.


389
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,007 line:-1
It supports drag-and-drop


390
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:10,511 line:-2
for powerful multi-window
and multi-app interactions.


391
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:14,214 line:-2
Its content can be organized
into collapsible sections.


392
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:16,550 line:-1
It can be used as an overlay


393
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,952 line:-2
so that it's always available
but never in the way.


394
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,458 line:-2
And you can interact with it
using fluid swipe gestures,


395
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,894 line:-2
so bringing it into view
or getting it out of the way


396
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,161 line:-1
are fast and easy.


397
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:33,500 line:-2
And, finally, it brings the benefit
of three-column layouts to all iPads.


398
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:37,004 line:-2
Now let's discuss some strategies
for adding a sidebar to your app.


399
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,474 line:-2
Let's start with a quick look
at two styles of app navigation


400
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,876 line:-2
that are particularly well-suited
for the sidebar:


401
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,078 line:-1
flat and hierarchical.


402
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:48,382 line:-1
A flat navigation, as the name implies,


403
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:52,986 line:-2
uses a relatively flat structure
of similarly weighted top-level content.


404
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:57,658 line:-2
Even if one or two of those sections
has some depth to that content within,


405
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:01,094 line:-2
the primary destinations
tend to be similarly weighted.


406
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:05,199 line:-2
In apps like this, you generally use
a tab bar to navigate sections.


407
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,501 line:-1
Think apps like Photos or Music.


408
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,170 line:-2
A hierarchical navigation
is common in apps


409
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:12,840 line:-2
that are more about
organizing and traversing


410
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:15,242 line:-1
potentially deep layers of content.


411
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,477 line:-1
Think apps like Mail or Notes.


412
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,281 line:-2
Now, unless your app is
something immersive like a game,


413
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:23,851 line:-2
it likely falls into
one of these two categories,


414
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,286 line:-1
and both work great with the new sidebar.


415
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:28,455 line:-1
Okay, so where do we begin?


416
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:32,125 line:-2
Well, if you already have a tab bar,
it's the perfect place to start.


417
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:36,630 line:-2
Tab bars are one of the most useful tools
for making navigation simple.


418
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:40,334 line:-2
When you see one, you know right away
where you are and where else you can go.


419
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,270 line:-2
And they're instantly familiar
to iPad and iPhone users,


420
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:47,074 line:-2
so there's no learning curve for people
checking out your app for the first time,


421
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,878 line:-2
and they clearly convey
the most important places in your app.


422
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:53,046 line:-2
So no matter
how complicated your app gets,


423
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:56,450 line:-2
tabs provide easy to understand
structure to your app.


424
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:59,119 line:-2
So, as you start to think
about incorporating the sidebar,


425
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:03,323 line:-2
we suggest taking existing tabs
and putting them at the top.


426
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:06,360 line:-2
Think of this space
at the top of the sidebar


427
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,462 line:-1
as a tab bar equivalent.


428
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:12,699 line:-2
Whatever you put here will be interpreted
as the most important places in your app.


429
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,601 line:-2
But don't get rid
of your tab bar entirely.


430
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:18,772 line:-2
The sidebar
is only for regular-width layouts.


431
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,607 line:-1
If you already have a tab bar,


432
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,577 line:-2
you should continue to use it
in compact-width layouts,


433
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:25,445 line:-1
and, likewise, on iPhone.


434
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:28,215 line:-2
Make sure you have
the same top-level items


435
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:30,517 line:-1
in both your sidebar and your tab bar.


436
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:34,922 line:-2
This will ensure your app feels familiar,
regardless of size class.


437
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:38,458 line:-2
Now you're ready to decide
what else should go into your sidebar.


438
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:41,595 line:-1
Consider all of the content in your app.


439
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:46,200 line:-2
We've found the things
most well-suited for sidebar placement


440
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:48,268 line:-1
tends to be longer lists of content,


441
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,705 line:-2
especially if that content
is user-generated in some way.


442
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:55,576 line:-2
Think albums in Photos
or playlists in Music.


443
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:58,345 line:-2
Put these items
below your primary navigation.


444
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,017 line:-2
And, as you add content to the sidebar,
nest it under a collapsible header.


445
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:06,520 line:-2
This will ensure
you maintain the correct hierarchy


446
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:09,990 line:-2
between your top-level destinations
and the content below.


447
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:14,127 line:-2
And it's okay if you end up creating
two ways to get to the same content,


448
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:18,131 line:-2
maybe through one of the top-level items,
and also through a folder below.


449
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:19,766 line:-1
That's totally fine.


450
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,002 line:-2
Think of the items
you put into the sidebar


451
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:25,405 line:-2
as shortcuts
to people's most important content.


452
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:28,275 line:-1
You may choose to add additional content,


453
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:31,512 line:-2
but resist the urge
to surface your entire app.


454
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,680 line:-1
If the sidebar becomes overloaded


455
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:37,851 line:-2
and requires a lot of scrolling
and uncollapsing sections to find things,


456
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:41,588 line:-2
it's no longer serving its purpose
as a quick jumping-off point.


457
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:45,225 line:-2
Finally, if your sidebar content
is user configurable,


458
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:47,928 line:-1
it's a great idea to include add buttons.


459
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:51,365 line:-2
Place them at the bottom
of each configurable section.


460
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:54,668 line:-2
This enables people
to create content in-line


461
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:57,304 line:-2
in the same place
they'll use that content.


462
00:23:57,371 --> 00:24:01,275 line:-2
If your app's navigation more closely
resembles the hierarchical model,


463
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:04,912 line:-2
surface the top-level content
in the top of your sidebar.


464
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:10,250 line:-2
You might have multiple top-of-tree items
to stack here, and that's fine.


465
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:12,953 line:-2
Again, think of apps like Mail,
for example,


466
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,622 line:-2
which could have multiple mailboxes
located here.


467
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:20,127 line:-2
Then below that, add shortcuts
to the most important places in your app.


468
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:22,362 line:-1
Keep in mind, however,


469
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:27,167 line:-2
the sidebar is not suited for browsing
deep, nested levels of hierarchy.


470
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:31,104 line:-2
This entire tree of content here
shouldn't be forced into the sidebar.


471
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:32,606 line:-1
So if that's your app,


472
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,044 line:-2
use the content area instead
for navigating hierarchy.


473
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,847 line:-2
The sidebar should be reserved
as a jumping-off point


474
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,516 line:-2
to the most important places
in that hierarchy.


475
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,119 line:-2
Let's wrap things up
with a few quick tips to keep in mind


476
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:48,255 line:-1
as you're implementing your first sidebar.


477
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:49,656 line:-1
First, some don'ts.


478
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:53,560 line:-2
Don't use sidebars in compact-width
size classes, including iPhone.


479
00:24:53,627 --> 00:24:56,430 line:-2
Instead, sidebars should convert
to tab bars


480
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,665 line:-1
or standard table rows in compact.


481
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:02,236 line:-2
And don't mix sidebars and tab bars
in the same view.


482
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:04,438 line:-1
Sidebars and tab bars are meant to be


483
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:07,140 line:-2
two different presentations
of the same content.


484
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:10,511 line:-2
Mixing them creates
a confusing navigational structure.


485
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:14,815 line:-2
And, finally, resist the urge
to surface your entire app in the sidebar.


486
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:17,651 line:-2
Okay, now let's look over
a list of tips you should do


487
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:19,853 line:-1
when implementing your first sidebar.


488
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,422 line:-1
Keep primary navigation at the top.


489
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:25,125 line:-2
This is the most visible place
in a sidebar app


490
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:28,695 line:-2
and where your users will look
to navigate the key sections of your app.


491
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:33,634 line:-2
Convert sidebars to tab bars
in compact-width layouts.


492
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,069 line:-2
If your app has a tab bar
in compact-width,


493
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:38,906 line:-2
your users will expect to find
the same key places


494
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:41,208 line:-1
in both your sidebar and your tab bar.


495
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:45,112 line:-2
We also suggest using outlined glyphs
in the sidebar,


496
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,581 line:-2
though keep the filled in glyphs
for your tab bar.


497
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:52,319 line:-2
As you consider additional content
to add to your sidebar,


498
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:55,689 line:-2
be sure to start with the content
that's most important to your users.


499
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:58,258 line:-1
Keep it below the primary navigation.


500
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:01,562 line:-2
So list-style content
and anything user-generated


501
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:02,996 line:-1
are both great options here.


502
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:07,367 line:-2
And be sure to nest those items
under a collapsible header.


503
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:10,070 line:-1
Support edit mode,


504
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:13,540 line:-2
so that users can customize the sidebar
to their specific needs,


505
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:16,076 line:-1
and make sure to support drag-and-drop.


506
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:19,479 line:-2
Your users will expect
to be able to drag items


507
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:21,215 line:-1
into folders in the sidebar,


508
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:23,750 line:-2
and they'll also expect to be able
to drag content


509
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:26,653 line:-2
directly into the sidebar itself
to create a shortcut.


510
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,523 line:-1
Great. That wraps up sidebars.


511
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,992 line:-1
Let's move on to a quick look at toolbars.


512
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:35,295 line:-1
It's another way we've optimized iPadOS 14


513
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:37,698 line:-2
to make better use
of the screen real estate on iPad.


514
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:42,736 line:-2
Now, in iPadOS 13, we had some toolbars
that took up more space than needed.


515
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,140 line:-2
Similar to some of our rather empty
tab bars we saw earlier,


516
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:49,776 line:-2
this toolbar doesn't feel like
a great use of space,


517
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:54,448 line:-2
so we've moved a lot of toolbar items
to the top in iPadOS 14.


518
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:58,819 line:-2
The placement makes better use
of this large display.


519
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:02,656 line:-2
However, when there's less room,
such as in compact-width,


520
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:04,892 line:-1
these toolbar items stay at the bottom.


521
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,695 line:-2
So just a couple quick tips
to keep in mind


522
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:11,131 line:-2
as you're working on toolbars
in your iPad app.


523
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:15,636 line:-2
Default to placing toolbar buttons
at the top in iPadOS.


524
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:18,138 line:-1
Now, this isn't always possible,


525
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:22,176 line:-2
but for one, two,
and three-button toolbars, it often is.


526
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:26,980 line:-2
Use an alternate layout in compact-width
to move toolbar items to the bottom


527
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:29,349 line:-2
when there isn't the room
to place them at the top.


528
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:33,720 line:-2
Great. That was a look at the new
iPadOS 14 sidebars and toolbars.


529
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:37,090 line:-2
Let's go back to Grant
to recap what we've discussed today.


530
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,158 line:-1
Thanks, Vince.


531
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:41,361 line:-2
You know,
if there's one theme from this talk today,


532
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:44,464 line:-2
it's that making a great iPad app
doesn't come for free.


533
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:48,168 line:-2
You need to design your app
specifically for the iPad.


534
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,605 line:-2
The ways you can do that
are flattening your navigation,


535
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:54,007 line:-1
letting your content fill the display,


536
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:58,178 line:-2
showing more content
and giving users additional context.


537
00:27:58,245 --> 00:28:00,848 line:-2
It means supporting
all of the iPad's inputs:


538
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:05,018 line:-2
Trackpad, Keyboard, Pencil,
and, of course, Multi-Touch,


539
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:08,555 line:-2
and making them work together
for some great interactions.


540
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:11,725 line:-2
It means using sidebars
for really fast navigation


541
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:13,160 line:-1
rather than tab bars,


542
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:16,630 line:-2
and including your top-level content
in the sidebar


543
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:20,000 line:-2
to make it just a single tap away
from anywhere in your app.


544
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:23,036 line:-2
And it means putting
your actions and your controls


545
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:26,773 line:-2
into the top navigation bar
rather than in toolbars at the bottom,


546
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,309 line:-1
to make best use of the iPad's display.


547
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:31,044 line:-1
That's all we have.


548
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:32,379 line:-1
If you're interested in more,


549
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:34,548 line:-2
I'd really recommend
checking out the session


550
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:37,217 line:0
on the new controls in iOS 14.


551
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:41,655 line:0
Those new controls are gonna work great
in your iPadOS and your Mac Catalyst apps


552
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,257 line:0
in addition to on the iPhone.


553
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:47,628 line:0
You can also go deeper in how to build
all of these features into your apps


554
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:49,663 line:0
with the session "Build For iPad."


555
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,833 line:0
It'll show you how to use all of these
from within your code.


556
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,370 line:-2
We're really looking forward to seeing
all of the great iPad apps that you make.


557
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:57,437 line:-1
Thank you.
