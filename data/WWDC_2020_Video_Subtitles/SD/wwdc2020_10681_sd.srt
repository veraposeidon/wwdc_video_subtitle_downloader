1
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:06,707 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:11,712 line:0
Hello, WWDC. This is Swan's Quest.


3
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,548 line:0
I'm Rob, your host,
as we take an inside look


4
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:18,619 line:0
at an exciting Swift Playgrounds challenge
our crack team has built for you.


5
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:22,589 line:0
This was built to remind you
that writing code should be fun.


6
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,958 line:-1
Swift Playgrounds is an environment.


7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,528 line:-1
It's jam-packed with frameworks and APIs


8
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:31,064 line:-2
that make it simple to experiment
with complicated technologies


9
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,566 line:-1
while writing less code.


10
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,669 line:-2
This allows you to focus
on what you want to build


11
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,539 line:-2
instead of spending your time
figuring out how to build it.


12
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:40,207 line:-1
In this episode...


13
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:45,579 line:-2
we're gonna introduce you to Swan's Quest,
which is divided into four chapters.


14
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:49,616 line:-2
Each chapter has a specific
programming challenge for you


15
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,552 line:-1
that will build on the prior chapters.


16
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,421 line:-2
This first challenge
requires you to navigate


17
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,690 line:-1
through a dark and mysterious cave.


18
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:01,195 line:-2
You're gonna be armed only with VoiceOver
and our easy-to-use APIs


19
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,464 line:-2
for providing descriptive context
to on-screen elements.


20
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,835 line:-2
We'll discuss how to turn on VoiceOver
for your device,


21
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,671 line:-2
then give you a primer
on the Accessibility APIs


22
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,340 line:-1
that we use to make our education content


23
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,577 line:-2
the most accessible
programming environment in the world.


24
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:20,581 line:-2
Finally, we'll give you some clues
on how to use these APIs


25
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,083 line:-1
to navigate the cave and meet our Swan.


26
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,552 line:-1
Are you ready to get started?


27
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,756 line:-1
Swan's Quest is a four-part challenge,


28
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,992 line:-2
where you're gonna use
your programming skill


29
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,895 line:-2
to guide our brave Turtle
on their epic quest.


30
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,033 line:-2
Our Turtle's journey sends them
into a dark, dark cave


31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,802 line:-1
in search of a royal Swan.


32
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,939 line:-2
The Swan can grant the Turtle safe passage
through their kingdom,


33
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,376 line:-2
but only if the Turtle
can win their favor first.


34
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,212 line:-1
To win favor,


35
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:56,049 line:-2
the Turtle must complete a series
of musical challenges from the Swan.


36
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,886 line:-1
That's where the Turtle needs your help...


37
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,758 line:-2
and the help of a local Lizard,
who helps decode the Swan's clues.


38
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:09,429 line:-2
The Lizard gives you hints
about which APIs to use along the way.


39
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,302 line:-2
Swan's Quest consists
of four programming exercises,


40
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,271 line:-1
which were built using the same frameworks


41
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,807 line:-2
that we used to deliver education content
with Swift Playgrounds.


42
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,944 line:-2
We use this framework
to teach beginning programmers


43
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,612 line:-1
how to write code in Swift.


44
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,782 line:-1
But did you know you can remix our content


45
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,985 line:-2
and use the same frameworks
for your projects?


46
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:36,323 line:-2
The best way to get started with our SDK
is our starting points,


47
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,025 line:-1
like the three that you see here.


48
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,294 line:-1
These are templated playground books


49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,730 line:-2
that allow you to create new pages
and new Swift modules


50
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,299 line:-1
without leaving Swift Playgrounds.


51
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,435 line:-2
For each of these templates,
we include the same modules


52
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,071 line:-2
built to create
their guided learning companions.


53
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:56,210 line:-2
We make it easy to experiment
with our audio APIs in Sonic Create,


54
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:00,848 line:-2
take advantage of different iPad sensors
in Sensor Create,


55
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:05,519 line:-2
and create your own augmented reality
experiences with AR Create,


56
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,055 line:-1
using custom art from Sarah Rothberg.


57
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,760 line:-2
For Swan's Quest, we created a new,
more powerful template


58
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:17,030 line:-2
that combines API
from several of our starting points.


59
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,268 line:-2
You can download this template,
along with Swan's Quest,


60
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,903 line:-1
directly from the Developer app.


61
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,341 line:-2
And like all of our provided content,
these books are open-source.


62
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,110 line:-2
That means that you can unpack them
on your Mac,


63
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,614 line:-2
and you can see how we use the APIs
to build each challenge.


64
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,717 line:-1
During our four sessions,


65
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,854 line:-2
I'm gonna describe some of the APIs
you'll need to complete each challenge.


66
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:46,693 line:-2
For today's challenge, you're going to use
our Accessibility APIs and VoiceOver.


67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,161 line:-1
And you're gonna need it.


68
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,396 line:-1
You'll need both of them


69
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:53,300 line:-2
to get out of this dark cave
between you and our Swan.


70
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:58,138 line:-2
Lucky for you, my first guest, Jordyn,
is an ace on our assistive technologies.


71
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,175 line:-2
She's here to give you
a crash course on VoiceOver.


72
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:07,281 line:-2
Pay attention, because VoiceOver is the
best tool to solve the riddle of our Cave.


73
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,517 line:-1
Thanks, Rob. Hey, everybody.


74
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,954 line:-2
My name's Jordyn, and I'm an
accessibility engineer here at Apple.


75
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,958 line:-2
I not only help build Apple's
assistive technology,


76
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,461 line:-2
but I use it every day to keep in touch
with my family and friends,


77
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,697 line:-1
order food for my adorable cats,


78
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,733 line:-2
learn to play piano and, of course,
write code.


79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,203 line:0
Speaking of coding, let's dive right in.


80
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,639 line:0
To complete the first challenge,
you're going to use VoiceOver.


81
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,211 line:0
VoiceOver is Apple's screen reader,
and it's built into all of our products.


82
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,381 line:-2
It provides information about text,
controls, and other elements


83
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,417 line:-1
as you move through an app's interface


84
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,621 line:-2
using text-to-speech, braille,
or a combination of the two.


85
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,559 line:-2
You'll need VoiceOver to navigate
through a dark, spooky cave


86
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,695 line:-1
and write code to help light your path.


87
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,899 line:-2
You heard me right.
You're gonna write code using VoiceOver.


88
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,467 line:-1
But don't worry.


89
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,670 line:-2
It's not that hard once you get
the hang of it. Take it from me.


90
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,674 line:-2
Before we begin,
let's set up your Accessibility Shortcut.


91
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:11,512 line:-2
This will allow you to turn on or off
Accessibility Settings quickly


92
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:16,149 line:-2
by pressing the Home
or Sleep/Wake button three times.


93
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,053 line:-1
Go to Settings, Accessibility,


94
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,224 line:-2
and all the way at the bottom,
you'll see Accessibility Shortcut.


95
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,994 line:-1
Let's select "VoiceOver" here.


96
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,329 line:-1
Next, let's turn on VoiceOver.


97
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,934 line:-2
If you're on an iPad,
you can go into Settings, Accessibility,


98
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,003 line:-1
and VoiceOver.


99
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,272 line:-2
And you'll notice
a Toggle switch at the top.


100
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:41,842 line:-1
To enable it, turn on VoiceOver here


101
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,878 line:-2
or use the Accessibility Shortcut
we just set up.


102
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,782 line:-2
You can also ask Siri,
"Turn on VoiceOver."


103
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,986 line:-2
First, you'll hear the prompt,
"VoiceOver on."


104
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,190 line:-1
You may need to double-tap the OK button,


105
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,992 line:-2
confirming that
the gestures will be different


106
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,761 line:-1
once VoiceOver is enabled.


107
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:06,767 line:-2
The black rectangle around the selected
control is called your VoiceOver cursor,


108
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:11,805 line:-2
and it confirms visually
which item has VoiceOver's focus.


109
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,376 line:-1
Flick left or right with one finger


110
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,513 line:-2
to move the cursor over
different elements on the screen.


111
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:26,053 line:-2
[VoiceOver] <i>Accessibility features</i>
<i>Help, Vision, Heading, VoiceOver on,</i>


112
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,090 line:-1
<i>zoom off, VoiceOver on. Button.</i>


113
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:34,595 line:-2
Alternatively, you can drag
your finger around the screen


114
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,798 line:-2
to move the cursor
over elements more quickly.


115
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,503 line:-1
<i>Audio, VoiceOver--</i>


116
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:48,308 line:-2
Take a minute now to adjust
VoiceOver's speaking rate to your liking


117
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,810 line:-1
by swiping up or down


118
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,613 line:-2
on the Speaking Rate slider
with one finger.


119
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:01,355 line:-1
<i>Speaking Rate, 45%, 55, 65%, 75%.</i>


120
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,559 line:-1
<i>85%, 95%, 100%, 95%, 80%, 70%.</i>


121
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,098 line:-2
Many experienced VoiceOver users like
to turn the speaking rate all the way up


122
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,735 line:-2
to take in information quickly
and navigate efficiently.


123
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,605 line:-1
That's about 720 words per minute.


124
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,408 line:-1
That sounds a little something like this.


125
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,243 line:-1
<i>Speaking rate--</i>


126
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:33,487 line:-2
If you're wondering, yes,
I can understand VoiceOver that fast.


127
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:38,625 line:-2
To exit Settings, you'll need to either
press the Home button on your iPad,


128
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:43,096 line:-2
or if your device doesn't have
a Home button, slide one finger up


129
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:46,166 line:-2
from the bottom edge of the screen
until you hear the first sound.


130
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,604 line:-2
If you pause there, VoiceOver will say,
"Lift for Home."


131
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,209 line:-1
<i>Lift for Home.</i>


132
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,814 line:-2
Once you're on the Home Screen,
navigate to the Swift Playgrounds icon


133
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,816 line:-1
and double-tap to open it.


134
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,452 line:-1
<i>Playgrounds.</i>


135
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,487 line:-1
<i>Double--</i>


136
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:09,456 line:-1
<i>Playgrounds.</i>


137
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,959 line:-1
If you're on the Mac,


138
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:16,396 line:-2
you can use Command plus F5
or triple-click the Touch ID button


139
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,998 line:-1
to activate VoiceOver.


140
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:23,871 line:-2
Once activated, you can move
the VoiceOver cursor through the screen


141
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:28,942 line:-2
by pressing Control plus Option
plus either the left or right arrow keys.


142
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:35,082 line:-2
Likewise, you can navigate up and down
by using Control plus Option


143
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,384 line:-1
plus the Up or Down arrow keys.


144
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,287 line:-1
To enter a group of controls or elements,


145
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,524 line:-2
such as the source code editor
in Playgrounds,


146
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,161 line:-2
press Control plus Option
plus Shift plus the Down arrow


147
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,198 line:-1
to do what we like to call "interacting."


148
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,237 line:-2
And to stop interacting,
to get out of a group of controls,


149
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:02,142 line:-2
press Control plus Option
plus Shift plus the Up arrow key.


150
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:09,383 line:-2
Use Control plus Option
plus the space bar to activate a control.


151
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:13,053 line:-2
Now that you're familiar with VoiceOver,
how to turn it on,


152
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,324 line:-2
and a little bit of the basic gestures
and commands, I want to discuss


153
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:21,795 line:-2
a tragic experience that turns away
many blind people


154
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:25,365 line:-2
from using the amazing apps
that you develop.


155
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,468 line:-1
At Apple, we pride ourselves


156
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:32,172 line:-2
on best-in-class interface designs
for our products.


157
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,342 line:-2
And that same quality
is given to accessibility.


158
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,079 line:-2
Accessibility is one of Apple's
core values.


159
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,518 line:-2
So, when you turned on VoiceOver,
you were greeted with a wealth of context


160
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,521 line:-2
as you moved around Settings
and the Home Screen.


161
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:53,560 line:-2
Sadly, not all developers
pay this much attention to accessibility.


162
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,229 line:-1
And it shows.


163
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,933 line:-2
When you first download an app,
you hear it immediately.


164
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,805 line:-2
Instead of rich detail, I'm greeted
with a ton of unlabeled buttons.


165
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,809 line:-2
So, when I swipe around the screen,
all I hear is


166
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,845 line:-1
"button, button, button."


167
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,616 line:-2
And maybe some image file names
thrown in there for good measure.


168
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:21,088 line:-2
And in this case,
when I swipe around the screen, I hear...


169
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:26,627 line:-2
<i>Seen. Twenty-- Torch two, graphic.</i>
<i>Torch three, graphic.</i>


170
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,862 line:-1
<i>Torch six, graphic.</i>


171
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:33,133 line:-2
I'm left wondering,
"What do these torches look like?"


172
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,171 line:-1
"What am I supposed to do with these?"


173
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,473 line:-1
And in the case of the apps,


174
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,342 line:-2
I'm left guessing,
"What do these buttons do?"


175
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,745 line:-1
"And how am I supposed to use this?"


176
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:49,516 line:-2
To be honest,
I delete an app with unlabeled buttons


177
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,652 line:-1
within the first minute of opening it.


178
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:55,355 line:-2
But you have the power to change
this experience.


179
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,992 line:-2
You can make a better app interface
for everyone,


180
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:03,030 line:-2
starting by adding labels
to your buttons and controls.


181
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:08,135 line:-1
<i>Seen. Torch three. Tor-- Torch.</i>


182
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:11,538 line:-2
<i>A 12-inch rock blazing with a ball</i>
<i>of mystical blue flame.</i>


183
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,542 line:-2
Ah. That makes a lot more sense.
That sounds great.


184
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:21,181 line:-2
When people use Swift Playgrounds,
they expect a great user experience.


185
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:26,787 line:-2
Our content must be designed
for everyone to learn how to code.


186
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,056 line:-1
No exceptions.


187
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,161 line:-2
That's why my fellow engineers
built a simple-to-use API


188
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:38,765 line:-2
for building fully accessible
Swift Playgrounds content.


189
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:44,671 line:-2
To tell you more about these APIs,
I'd like to introduce my colleague


190
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,674 line:-1
from the Swift Playgrounds team, Stephen.


191
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,209 line:-1
Thanks, Jordyn.


192
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:53,180 line:-2
Hello. I'm Stephen, an education engineer
on the Swift Playgrounds team.


193
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:55,315 line:-2
We don't want anyone
to have the experience


194
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,017 line:-1
Jordyn described with our content.


195
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,686 line:-2
At Apple,
we believe that everyone can code,


196
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:03,624 line:-2
and that's why we've built a simple-to-use
accessibility interface


197
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,393 line:-1
into our Swift Playgrounds content SDK.


198
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,497 line:-2
There are four onscreen elements that
form the foundation of our content SDK:


199
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,701 line:-1
Graphic, Button, Sprite, and Label.


200
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,171 line:-1
All of them inherit from BaseGraphic,


201
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,806 line:-2
which contains properties
for accessibility support.


202
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,610 line:-2
Here, we see the optional
accessibilityHints property.


203
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,280 line:-1
Setting that property is how you indicate


204
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:29,149 line:-2
that this screen element
should be read by VoiceOver


205
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,718 line:-2
and makes it visible
to other assistive services.


206
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,822 line:-2
To support VoiceOver,
these are the values you need to supply.


207
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,961 line:-2
makeAccessibilityElement tells VoiceOver
it should stop the cursor on this item.


208
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:44,598 line:-2
accessibilityLabel is what VoiceOver reads
as it stops on the item.


209
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,367 line:-1
Let's walk through an example.


210
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,971 line:-2
First, you create an instance
of accessibilityHints.


211
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,841 line:-2
We want VoiceOver
to stop on this graphic and read,


212
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,709 line:-1
"Activate button to start the party."


213
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,847 line:-2
We then create our graphic
and set its accessibilityHints


214
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,382 line:-2
to the hints variable
we created in the first step.


215
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,785 line:-1
I hope this example makes sense,


216
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:08,155 line:-2
because you're gonna need it
to complete our first challenge.


217
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,423 line:-1
Thanks, Stephen.


218
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,826 line:-2
As you probably guessed,
our first challenge, "Voices in the Dark,"


219
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:16,597 line:-2
is all about making onscreen controls
more accessible.


220
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:20,000 line:-2
When you enter our cave,
none of the torches are lit.


221
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,736 line:-2
In fact,
you won't be able to see anything.


222
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,573 line:-2
And your character, they're not gonna move
until you light enough torches.


223
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:31,011 line:-2
To light the torches, you need to set
an accessibility label on them.


224
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,115 line:-2
With VoiceOver, you'll be able
to navigate to each of them.


225
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:38,085 line:-2
And when you land on one,
you'll hear a property name like


226
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,254 line:-1
"Torch one" or "Torch three."


227
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,825 line:-2
Once you've added
an accessibility label to each torch,


228
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:48,161 line:-2
your character can pass through the cave
and meet our Swan.


229
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,099 line:-1
In the Playgrounds source editor,


230
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:56,136 line:-2
you need to replace that unhelpful label
with something more descriptive.


231
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,405 line:-1
Use your ears and change the label.


232
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,377 line:-2
Like you see here, once you do,
you'll be off to meet the Swan


233
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,746 line:-1
and get a clue for our next challenge.


234
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:09,383 line:-2
During this episode,
we introduced you to Swan's Quest,


235
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,120 line:-2
an exciting four-part challenge
for WWDC attendees.


236
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,589 line:-1
We introduced you to VoiceOver


237
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:18,859 line:-2
and how to use Swift Playgrounds
to write accessible software.


238
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,827 line:-1
And finally, we gave you some tips


239
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:24,765 line:-2
on how to navigate the cave
on your way to meet our Swan.


240
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,968 line:-2
We'll be back tomorrow
to talk about Chapter 2.


241
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,838 line:-1
Until then, good luck, have fun,


242
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:35,642 line:-2
and drop into the forums to let us know
what you thought of our first challenge.
