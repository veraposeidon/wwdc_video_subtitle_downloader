>> LISA JACKSON: Hi.


2
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:09,533 line:79% position:50% size:63%
I'm Lisa Jackson and I
lead Environment, Policy,


3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,866 line:79% position:50% size:55%
and Social
Initiatives for Apple.


4
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:14,433 line:79% position:50% size:55%
Thank you so much for
joining us for today's


5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,899 line:79% position:50% size:48%
WWDC conversation
on race in America.


6
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:22,800 line:79% position:50% size:65%
I am so honored to be here
today and beyond excited


7
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:26,066 line:79% position:50% size:63%
to be joined by my dear
friend and former cabinet


8
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:28,833 line:79% position:50% size:65%
colleague, former Attorney
General of the United


9
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,766 line:85% position:50% size:50%
States, Eric Holder.


10
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,033 line:79% position:50% size:60%
Now, before we get
started, I want to say a


11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,100 line:85% position:50% size:55%
few things about Eric.


12
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,166 line:85% position:50% size:50%
There's the obvious.


13
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,533 line:79% position:50% size:63%
He was the very first
Black Attorney General of


14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,233 line:79% position:50% size:63%
the United States and one
of the longest serving


15
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,033 line:79% position:50% size:40%
AGs, a tough job
in a tough town.


16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,733 line:79% position:50% size:53%
He came to the
administration with a


17
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,966 line:79% position:50% size:60%
remarkable record as a
successful attorney both


18
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:54,100 line:79% position:50% size:50%
in government and in
the private sector.


19
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,299 line:79% position:50% size:60%
But the most notable
attribute I want to call


20
00:00:56,366 --> 00:01:00,299 line:79% position:50% size:70%
out is his unwavering
commitment to equal justice.


21
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:03,566 line:79% position:50% size:65%
In fact, Time Magazine
noted this when they named


22
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:06,266 line:79% position:50% size:48%
him to their list
of one hundred most


23
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,700 line:85% position:50% size:48%
influential people.


24
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:09,966 line:79% position:50% size:55%
And that's a big part
of what we're going to


25
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,966 line:85% position:50% size:43%
talk about today.


26
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,466 line:79% position:50% size:55%
So, Eric, welcome
to your first Dub-Dub.


27
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,500 line:85% position:50% size:55%
Thanks for being here.


28
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:16,500 line:79% position:50% size:68%
>> ERIC HOLDER: Well,
thanks for having me, Lisa.


29
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:17,733 line:79% position:50% size:40%
It's always
good to see you.


30
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,333 line:79% position:50% size:53%
>> LISA JACKSON: Now,
s we're talking about


31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,666 line:79% position:50% size:55%
justice now in a time
where we're surrounded


32
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,533 line:79% position:50% size:55%
by gripping and
painful reminders that


33
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,900 line:85% position:50% size:50%
the fight continues.


34
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:30,900 line:79% position:50% size:68%
For many of us, this has
been a reality of our life.


35
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:34,433 line:79% position:50% size:65%
But for others, this seems
to be a new realization.


36
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,866 line:79% position:50% size:53%
So, what do you make
of what feels like an


37
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:40,500 line:79% position:50% size:58%
all-time high in public
awareness around this


38
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,433 line:85% position:50% size:35%
set of issues?


39
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,433 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> ERIC HOLDER: Well, you
know, I think we're in the


40
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,900 line:79% position:50% size:60%
throes of a generational
racial awakening.


41
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:53,266 line:79% position:50% size:65%
I think that these happen
every so often in American


42
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,866 line:79% position:50% size:53%
history and I think
we're on the verge of


43
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:56,366 line:85% position:50% size:43%
another one here.


44
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,599 line:79% position:50% size:50%
What people saw in
Minneapolis with the


45
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:02,466 line:79% position:50% size:65%
death, the killing of
George Floyd, coupled with


46
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:05,500 line:79% position:50% size:60%
other videos that people
have seen, coupled with


47
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:08,765 line:79% position:50% size:65%
just, I think, a general
unease about things racial


48
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,599 line:79% position:50% size:58%
in the United States, I
think we've seen people


49
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,666 line:79% position:50% size:63%
get into the streets,
express concerns not only


50
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,800 line:79% position:50% size:60%
about what we see in our
criminal justice system,


51
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:19,633 line:79% position:50% size:65%
but more generally about
the condition of people of


52
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,833 line:79% position:50% size:35%
color in the
United States.


53
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,300 line:79% position:50% size:63%
I think we are as I
said, at the beginning of


54
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,466 line:79% position:50% size:55%
something that I think
ultimately is going to


55
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:27,833 line:79% position:50% size:40%
lead to some
positive change.


56
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,199 line:79% position:50% size:58%
I'm actually cautiously
optimistic about where


57
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:33,099 line:79% position:50% size:43%
this movement is
going to take us.


58
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,166 line:85% position:50% size:53%
>> LISA JACKSON: Wow.


59
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:36,300 line:79% position:50% size:65%
That's great to hear
because there's definitely


60
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:39,266 line:79% position:50% size:65%
a lot of energy out in the
streets and there's also


61
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,900 line:79% position:50% size:55%
energy in places
across the country, in


62
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:46,866 line:79% position:50% size:55%
boardrooms, in
companies, in schools.


63
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,400 line:79% position:50% size:53%
In 2009, you famously
called this country a


64
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:54,966 line:79% position:50% size:63%
nation of cowards for our
failure to talk openly


65
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:57,400 line:85% position:50% size:50%
about racial issues.


66
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:59,933 line:79% position:50% size:55%
And you took some
heat for that comment.


67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,900 line:85% position:50% size:38%
Now look at us.


68
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:06,800 line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, how many people have
called to apologize?


69
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,766 line:79% position:50% size:63%
>> ERIC HOLDER: I'm still
waiting by the phone to


70
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,933 line:79% position:50% size:65%
get those apologies or you
know, some indication that


71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000 line:79% position:50% size:60%
maybe I called something
right back in 2009.


72
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:18,199 line:79% position:50% size:63%
The point of that speech
was, and it's still true,


73
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,500 line:79% position:50% size:63%
I think, today, here in
the United States, we are


74
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:23,733 line:79% position:50% size:60%
experts at avoiding
conversations about race


75
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,233 line:79% position:50% size:55%
and in a lot of ways,
that's understandable.


76
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,633 line:79% position:50% size:65%
These are painful, awkward
conversations but they're


77
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,233 line:85% position:50% size:60%
necessary conversations.


78
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,033 line:79% position:50% size:65%
If we want to get to a
better place when it comes


79
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,733 line:79% position:50% size:58%
to racial things, we've
got to discuss our


80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,099 line:79% position:50% size:55%
history, we have to be
cognizant of what the


81
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,166 line:79% position:50% size:63%
present is all about,
and we have to talk about


82
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,966 line:79% position:50% size:43%
where we want to
go in the future.


83
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:45,099 line:79% position:50% size:50%
Now, this means that
we have to ask tough


84
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,233 line:85% position:50% size:63%
questions of one another.


85
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,300 line:79% position:50% size:58%
We have to face some
hard historical truths.


86
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:52,133 line:79% position:50% size:65%
But if we don't engage in
these conversations, we're


87
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,233 line:79% position:50% size:65%
not going to make the kind
of progress that we want.


88
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,133 line:79% position:50% size:53%
So, that was the
point of that speech.


89
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,466 line:79% position:50% size:58%
I think the speech has
actually held up pretty


90
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:02,433 line:79% position:50% size:63%
well and what I said back
then, you know, about


91
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,199 line:79% position:50% size:65%
Americans being reluctant,
hesitant to talk about


92
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:08,666 line:79% position:50% size:63%
racial things, I think is
unfortunately still true,


93
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,666 line:79% position:50% size:60%
but I think those people
in the streets, those


94
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,333 line:79% position:50% size:65%
people in the streets are
going to force this nation


95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,666 line:79% position:50% size:63%
into a very needed - a
very needed conversation.


96
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:21,033 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> LISA JACKSON: Something
we can no longer avoid and


97
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,933 line:85% position:50% size:60%
that we shouldn't avoid.


98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,100 line:79% position:50% size:58%
>> ERIC HOLDER: I think
that's just, you know,


99
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,000 line:85% position:50% size:53%
that's the beginning.


100
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:27,166 line:79% position:50% size:60%
We have to have the
conversation but then we


101
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,699 line:79% position:50% size:53%
have to use that
conversation and that


102
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:31,500 line:79% position:50% size:60%
necessary interaction
to come up with concrete


103
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:34,733 line:79% position:50% size:60%
steps to take us to that
better place, change


104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,399 line:79% position:50% size:55%
policies, put in place
measures that will


105
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:40,533 line:79% position:50% size:63%
alleviate the unfairness,
the injustice that still


106
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,399 line:85% position:50% size:58%
exists in this country.


107
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:44,633 line:79% position:50% size:73%
>> LISA JACKSON: So, that's -
that's interesting.


108
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,533 line:79% position:50% size:60%
Let's talk about policy
because I know you're an


109
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,399 line:79% position:50% size:35%
expert on the
police system.


110
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:52,333 line:79% position:50% size:63%
You were our nation's top
law enforcement official


111
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,800 line:79% position:50% size:55%
and so much of your
career centered on law


112
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,399 line:85% position:50% size:65%
enforcement at all levels.


113
00:04:56,466 --> 00:05:00,366 line:79% position:50% size:65%
How do you contextualize
the fight for justice with


114
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,733 line:79% position:50% size:55%
the glaring injustices
we're seeing carried


115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,199 line:85% position:50% size:35%
out by police?


116
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:09,466 line:79% position:50% size:65%
And what do you see from
a policy perspective about


117
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,600 line:85% position:50% size:38%
moving forward?


118
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,933 line:79% position:50% size:58%
>> ERIC HOLDER: Well,
firstly, I think people


119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,333 line:79% position:50% size:58%
need to understand that
you know, people find


120
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,066 line:79% position:50% size:55%
racism in the criminal
justice system.


121
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:19,833 line:79% position:50% size:50%
Well, that shouldn't
be shocking.


122
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:22,433 line:79% position:50% size:65%
We are still a nation that
is dealing with racism


123
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,066 line:85% position:50% size:58%
throughout our society.


124
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:27,399 line:79% position:50% size:65%
And so, if you look at any
component of that society,


125
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:29,433 line:79% position:50% size:40%
you would expect
to find racism.


126
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,699 line:79% position:50% size:63%
Now, that's particularly
troublesome when it comes


127
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:34,333 line:79% position:50% size:58%
to the criminal justice
system where property,


128
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,366 line:79% position:50% size:48%
where life can be
taken by the state.


129
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:39,500 line:79% position:50% size:60%
And so, you want to make
sure that we have as


130
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:41,866 line:79% position:50% size:48%
neutral a system
as we possibly can.


131
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:45,233 line:79% position:50% size:65%
I mean, there are concrete
steps that can be taken.


132
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,233 line:79% position:50% size:53%
We need to, you
know, ban chokeholds.


133
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,333 line:79% position:50% size:40%
We need to have
better training.


134
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,366 line:79% position:50% size:58%
We need to be better
in our selection of who


135
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,100 line:85% position:50% size:65%
serves as police officers.


136
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,500 line:79% position:50% size:48%
We can investigate
police departments.


137
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:57,266 line:79% position:50% size:58%
All of those things are
important, extremely


138
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,300 line:79% position:50% size:58%
important, but we've
really got to deal with


139
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:02,166 line:79% position:50% size:63%
those larger societal
issues if we want to move


140
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:05,233 line:79% position:50% size:63%
our criminal justice
system to a better place.


141
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,600 line:79% position:50% size:65%
And that gets back, again,
to facing our history and


142
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,100 line:79% position:50% size:63%
dealing with these larger
issues, the fact that we


143
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,000 line:79% position:50% size:63%
don't have an educational
system that works for


144
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:17,300 line:79% position:50% size:65%
everybody in this country,
that fair employment is


145
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:20,399 line:79% position:50% size:63%
not necessarily something
that everybody enjoys


146
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:23,366 line:79% position:50% size:63%
here, that housing in the
United States of America


147
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:26,466 line:79% position:50% size:63%
is not necessarily made
available to everybody on


148
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:27,233 line:85% position:50% size:38%
an equal basis.


149
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,199 line:79% position:50% size:53%
You have to deal with
these core issues in


150
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:31,966 line:79% position:50% size:60%
addition to dealing with
those things that are


151
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:34,666 line:79% position:50% size:63%
manifest in the criminal
justice system if we want


152
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:37,833 line:79% position:50% size:35%
to get to that
better place.


153
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,800 line:79% position:50% size:63%
>> LISA JACKSON: To these
systemic issues, the ones


154
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,633 line:79% position:50% size:63%
that are sort of embedded
in how we run and how we


155
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,566 line:85% position:50% size:53%
live our daily lives.


156
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,399 line:85% position:50% size:60%
>> ERIC HOLDER: Exactly.


157
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:48,633 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I mean, it's - you can't
divorce the criminal


158
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,300 line:79% position:50% size:70%
justice system from the
society that it is apart of.


159
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:55,633 line:79% position:50% size:63%
And you know, this sounds
like a daunting task, you


160
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,233 line:79% position:50% size:65%
know, talking about
systemic changes of things


161
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,466 line:79% position:50% size:65%
that have been in place
for hundreds of years, but


162
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,899 line:79% position:50% size:55%
at the end of the day,
we're talking about


163
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:07,800 line:79% position:50% size:65%
manmade problems that are
susceptible to manmade and


164
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:09,466 line:85% position:50% size:50%
womanmade solutions.


165
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:12,000 line:79% position:50% size:60%
And that's what makes
me relatively, you know,


166
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,266 line:85% position:50% size:65%
relatively confident here.


167
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,266 line:79% position:50% size:35%
We've got this
new awakening.


168
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,600 line:79% position:50% size:40%
We've got people
in the streets.


169
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,466 line:79% position:50% size:58%
We have a new level of
civic engagement, a new


170
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,133 line:79% position:50% size:60%
level of interest, a new
willingness, I think, to


171
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,566 line:79% position:50% size:35%
confront those
hard issues.


172
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:26,899 line:79% position:50% size:60%
If we can maintain this,
this moment that we have


173
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:28,800 line:79% position:50% size:40%
can be turned
into a movement.


174
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,133 line:79% position:50% size:45%
So, that's what I
think can be done.


175
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,699 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I think it's going to
probably be led by young


176
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,800 line:79% position:50% size:63%
people as social change
in the past has tended to


177
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:37,766 line:85% position:50% size:28%
be as well.


178
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,733 line:79% position:50% size:78%
So, as I said, I'm cautiously -
cautiously optimistic.


179
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,500 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> LISA JACKSON: Now, you
know, Apple just announced


180
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:46,699 line:79% position:50% size:58%
our new Racial Equity
and Justice Initiative.


181
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,966 line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, at the heart of it is
Apple using our platforms,


182
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:54,366 line:79% position:50% size:73%
our voice, our resources
to challenge systemic racism.


183
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,933 line:79% position:50% size:58%
I know a lot of times,
inequalities are hidden


184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,899 line:85% position:50% size:35%
in the system.


185
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:02,600 line:79% position:50% size:63%
They're not always
directly able to be seen.


186
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,399 line:79% position:50% size:60%
Can you share some
examples of how this has


187
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:08,166 line:79% position:50% size:65%
shown up maybe in your own
life or in your career,


188
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:12,433 line:79% position:50% size:35%
the inequities
you've seen?


189
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,333 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> ERIC HOLDER: Well, as
an African American man in


190
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,800 line:79% position:50% size:63%
the United States of
America, you know, we all


191
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:19,300 line:79% position:50% size:58%
have stories, you
know, that we can tell.


192
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,800 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I remember going to run
to a movie in Georgetown


193
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:25,433 line:79% position:50% size:75%
which is a neighborhood
in Washington, D.C., very rich


194
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,733 line:79% position:50% size:73%
neighborhood, a predominantly
white neighborhood.


195
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,399 line:79% position:50% size:60%
It was evening, dark, so
I was running to a movie


196
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,732 line:85% position:50% size:53%
along with my cousin.


197
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,466 line:79% position:50% size:65%
Stopped by the police
because they saw two Black


198
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,600 line:79% position:50% size:60%
men running in a white
neighborhood and assumed


199
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,966 line:79% position:50% size:53%
that something must
have gone wrong here.


200
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,399 line:79% position:50% size:50%
It must be something
inappropriate.


201
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:44,799 line:79% position:50% size:63%
Stopped us, put the
spotlight on us, asked us


202
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:46,100 line:85% position:50% size:48%
what were we doing.


203
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,600 line:79% position:50% size:55%
I said well, you know,
going to see a movie.


204
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,966 line:79% position:50% size:55%
What they didn't
understand, the police


205
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,766 line:79% position:50% size:63%
officer didn't understand
is that they had stopped


206
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,233 line:79% position:50% size:50%
my cousin, a Vietnam
veteran and me.


207
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,333 line:79% position:50% size:50%
At the time, I was a
federal prosecutor.


208
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,100 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I was an employee of the
United States Department


209
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,466 line:79% position:50% size:78%
of Justice who worked with
police officers and FBI agents.


210
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,566 line:85% position:50% size:63%
But they didn't see that.


211
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,600 line:79% position:50% size:70%
They just saw two Black guys
and so you know, a story.


212
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:10,899 line:79% position:50% size:63%
And you know, my story is
not different than others


213
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:14,733 line:79% position:50% size:78%
that - other Black men -
that other Black men can share.


214
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,700 line:79% position:50% size:73%
So, that's, you know, a
very visible, personal thing.


215
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,299 line:79% position:50% size:63%
But then there are
systemic things that tend


216
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:22,466 line:79% position:50% size:35%
to be a little
more hidden.


217
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:27,133 line:79% position:50% size:60%
When you look at the
ways in which people are


218
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,766 line:79% position:50% size:63%
refused mortgages - red
lining is what we call it


219
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,000 line:85% position:50% size:53%
in the United States.


220
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:33,433 line:79% position:50% size:38%
You know, areas
are forbidden.


221
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,100 line:79% position:50% size:58%
Certain areas are
forbidden for people of


222
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,100 line:85% position:50% size:48%
color to locate in.


223
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,733 line:79% position:50% size:63%
So, you go to a bank, you
fill out an application,


224
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,500 line:79% position:50% size:50%
and your application
is rejected.


225
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:44,866 line:79% position:50% size:48%
You don't really
know why but it's a


226
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,333 line:85% position:50% size:63%
result of discrimination.


227
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,233 line:79% position:50% size:60%
We've brought lawsuits
against banks when I was


228
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:51,866 line:79% position:50% size:80%
the Attorney General to stop,
you know, to stop that practice.


229
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:55,366 line:79% position:50% size:65%
If you look at the Fortune
500, if you look at law


230
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:58,466 line:79% position:50% size:65%
firms, people of color are
simply not represented to


231
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,866 line:79% position:50% size:58%
the degree that you
would expect as leaders


232
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,500 line:85% position:50% size:58%
of those organizations.


233
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:05,033 line:79% position:50% size:60%
And these are people who
are, you know, there are


234
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,899 line:79% position:50% size:58%
significant numbers of
people of color who are


235
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:10,333 line:79% position:50% size:65%
qualified, who should have
opportunities to lead, but


236
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,799 line:79% position:50% size:65%
they simply don't get
those opportunities and as


237
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:16,000 line:79% position:50% size:60%
a result, we have again,
these silent barriers,


238
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:19,133 line:79% position:50% size:63%
these silent glass
ceilings that keep people


239
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,466 line:79% position:50% size:55%
away from positions of
leadership that they


240
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,299 line:85% position:50% size:55%
otherwise should have.


241
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:24,633 line:85% position:50% size:55%
>> LISA JACKSON: Yeah.


242
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,266 line:79% position:50% size:65%
When I'm explaining it to
people, I sometimes remind


243
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,866 line:79% position:50% size:60%
them of something I'm
sure you heard from your


244
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:31,700 line:79% position:50% size:63%
parents, which is my
mother and father used to


245
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:34,799 line:79% position:50% size:63%
say, you have to be three
times as good to get you


246
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:35,933 line:85% position:50% size:55%
know, a third as much.


247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,133 line:79% position:50% size:55%
So, I think, you know,
this idea of striving.


248
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,833 line:79% position:50% size:65%
We're not afraid of doing
the work but if the system


249
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,366 line:79% position:50% size:60%
is stacked against you,
it leads to frustration.


250
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:47,766 line:85% position:50% size:45%
It leads to anger.


251
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,766 line:85% position:50% size:53%
>> ERIC HOLDER: Yeah.


252
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,366 line:79% position:50% size:65%
You know, it's interesting
because I've heard certain


253
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:53,700 line:79% position:50% size:63%
people say it's an
exhausting thing to be an


254
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:56,100 line:79% position:50% size:58%
African American and
have to deal with these


255
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,933 line:79% position:50% size:63%
stereotypes, to deal with
the prejudice, to deal


256
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,233 line:85% position:50% size:60%
with the discrimination.


257
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:01,833 line:79% position:50% size:55%
And I thought to
myself, you know what?


258
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:06,133 line:79% position:50% size:65%
It really isn't exhausting
because we train for this


259
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,133 line:79% position:50% size:45%
from the day that
we leave the womb.


260
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,299 line:79% position:50% size:55%
It's something that
on a day to day basis,


261
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,066 line:85% position:50% size:38%
we get used to.


262
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:15,299 line:79% position:50% size:63%
It's something that we -
it's almost like training


263
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:17,233 line:85% position:50% size:63%
for a marathon. You know?


264
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:19,266 line:79% position:50% size:73%
Day after day after day,
you have to put up with this.


265
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,500 line:79% position:50% size:53%
You have to figure
out ways in which you


266
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:21,666 line:85% position:50% size:33%
deal with it.


267
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,933 line:79% position:50% size:75%
And after a while,
it becomes almost unconscious.


268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,566 line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's just kind of the way
you think that you have to


269
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:28,000 line:85% position:50% size:38%
lead your life.


270
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:31,333 line:79% position:50% size:63%
But you know, if you're
a person of color and you


271
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,700 line:79% position:50% size:63%
can imagine a world where
you wouldn't have to deal


272
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,700 line:79% position:50% size:63%
with all of those things,
boy, it would be a much


273
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:37,966 line:85% position:50% size:43%
better existence.


274
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:41,700 line:79% position:50% size:63%
And I think that hidden -
that hidden thing that we


275
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:44,200 line:79% position:50% size:60%
have to deal with really
does have a pernicious


276
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:47,100 line:79% position:50% size:63%
effect both on our psyche
and I think research


277
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,066 line:79% position:50% size:38%
shows, on our
bodies as well.


278
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:52,600 line:79% position:50% size:65%
High levels of tension
that leads to all kinds of


279
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,633 line:85% position:50% size:40%
health problems.


280
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,399 line:79% position:50% size:53%
But again, it's not
something that you're


281
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:58,700 line:79% position:50% size:65%
conscious of on a day to
day basis because you deal


282
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:01,700 line:79% position:50% size:58%
with it all the time
and you just accept it,


283
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:04,733 line:79% position:50% size:55%
unfortunately, for the
way life has to be.


284
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,866 line:79% position:50% size:38%
And that - that
has to change.


285
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,200 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> LISA JACKSON: You know,
I'm going to change the


286
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,366 line:85% position:50% size:53%
subject a little bit.


287
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:11,766 line:79% position:50% size:63%
I'm going to let that sit
there for a second but


288
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,799 line:79% position:50% size:60%
then I'm going to change
the subject just a bit.


289
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:18,899 line:79% position:50% size:65%
I was thinking back on
the drive this morning, to


290
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:23,933 line:85% position:50% size:63%
inauguration day in 2009.


291
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,433 line:79% position:50% size:58%
You and I, we were next
to each other with our


292
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,033 line:85% position:50% size:53%
spouses that morning.


293
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,733 line:79% position:50% size:55%
The weight of history,
the pageant of it all.


294
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:36,066 line:79% position:50% size:55%
We were both the first
Black heads of our


295
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:39,700 line:79% position:50% size:43%
respective
cabinet agencies.


296
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:41,266 line:79% position:50% size:35%
I am immensely
proud of that.


297
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,566 line:79% position:50% size:48%
I always say I was
the first Black EPA


298
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:45,500 line:79% position:50% size:55%
Administrator for the
first Black president.


299
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:48,833 line:79% position:50% size:63%
But it says something
about our country and our


300
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,666 line:85% position:50% size:63%
progress or lack thereof.


301
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:55,933 line:79% position:50% size:63%
Is it something you think
about and you know, how


302
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,733 line:85% position:50% size:45%
does that hit you?


303
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,000 line:85% position:50% size:53%
>> ERIC HOLDER: Yeah.


304
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:00,033 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I mean, it's
certainly something that


305
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,433 line:85% position:50% size:53%
I thought about then.


306
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,866 line:79% position:50% size:60%
It's certainly something
I reflect on now.


307
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:04,700 line:85% position:50% size:28%
It's clear.


308
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:07,733 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I wasn't the first Black
lawyer who was qualified


309
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,600 line:79% position:50% size:55%
to be Attorney General
of the United States.


310
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,466 line:79% position:50% size:63%
I mean, I'm very grateful
for the fact that I was


311
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:13,700 line:85% position:50% size:58%
given that opportunity.


312
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,600 line:85% position:50% size:60%
I hope I did a good job.


313
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,833 line:79% position:50% size:63%
You know, there's kind of
a dual pressure that you


314
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,899 line:85% position:50% size:53%
feel being the first.


315
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,899 line:79% position:50% size:65%
You don't want to
disappoint people who have


316
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:27,200 line:79% position:50% size:60%
sacrificed and supported
you and made it possible


317
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:30,566 line:79% position:50% size:65%
for you to become the
first head of the EPA, the


318
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,700 line:79% position:50% size:48%
first head of the
Justice Department.


319
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:34,700 line:85% position:50% size:45%
People sacrificed.


320
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:35,866 line:85% position:50% size:30%
People died.


321
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:37,399 line:79% position:50% size:65%
People committed
themselves so that other -


322
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:39,866 line:79% position:50% size:55%
next generations would
have opportunities to


323
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:41,066 line:85% position:50% size:58%
which they were denied.


324
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,833 line:79% position:50% size:38%
And so, there's
that pressure.


325
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,299 line:79% position:50% size:63%
Then there's also that
pressure that you want to


326
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,399 line:79% position:50% size:65%
make sure that you perform
for the larger world and


327
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:50,833 line:79% position:50% size:65%
so that the stereotypes of
lack of ability, of lack


328
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,866 line:79% position:50% size:65%
of performance, you dispel
those and you feel that


329
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,066 line:85% position:50% size:43%
pressure as well.


330
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,600 line:79% position:50% size:65%
You know, it's - it's a
lot of this stuff is about


331
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,299 line:79% position:50% size:50%
pressure, as I
talked about before.


332
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:04,266 line:79% position:50% size:65%
But again, you know, given
those opportunities, I


333
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,533 line:79% position:50% size:63%
think I felt and I'm sure
you felt a real duty to


334
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,533 line:79% position:50% size:63%
perform as best we could,
to move the needle, to


335
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,000 line:79% position:50% size:65%
open the doors for people
who would come - who would


336
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:15,833 line:85% position:50% size:35%
come after us.


337
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,166 line:79% position:50% size:63%
You know, it was great to
serve with you, to serve


338
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,200 line:85% position:50% size:53%
with President Obama.


339
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:25,066 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I remember that day in
2009 and the hope that I


340
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,133 line:79% position:50% size:63%
felt and I think the hope
that the nation felt.


341
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,299 line:79% position:50% size:63%
I think actually, the
hope that the world felt.


342
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:33,000 line:79% position:50% size:65%
And I think, you know, we
had a good eight-year run.


343
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,133 line:79% position:50% size:50%
There have been some
reversals since that


344
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,033 line:79% position:50% size:65%
period of time but I think
as I said, the United


345
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,333 line:79% position:50% size:58%
States, and I think the
world, is really on the


346
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:47,466 line:79% position:50% size:53%
verge of a new era,
a new and better era.


347
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:50,299 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> LISA JACKSON: One thing
we worked on together was


348
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:53,066 line:79% position:50% size:58%
environmental racism or
to fight environmental


349
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:56,299 line:79% position:50% size:55%
racism, to bring about
environmental justice.


350
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:59,366 line:79% position:50% size:58%
And you know, if we're
talking, environment is


351
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,433 line:85% position:50% size:43%
going to come up.


352
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,733 line:79% position:50% size:60%
We know that
communities of color are


353
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,766 line:79% position:50% size:55%
disproportionately
impacted by a range of


354
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,466 line:79% position:50% size:50%
environmental ills,
whether it's climate


355
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:11,600 line:79% position:50% size:65%
change, air quality, water
quality, drinking water


356
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:15,833 line:79% position:50% size:63%
quality, land use
decisions about what land


357
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,433 line:79% position:50% size:60%
we are even able to - to
consider developing in


358
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,100 line:79% position:50% size:40%
terms of housing
or schools.


359
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,033 line:79% position:50% size:55%
Is there space for an
issue like that in the


360
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,100 line:79% position:50% size:60%
conversations that we're
having in this moment?


361
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,500 line:79% position:50% size:48%
>> ERIC HOLDER: Oh,
there's not only


362
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,033 line:85% position:50% size:38%
space for that.


363
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,333 line:79% position:50% size:60%
That is a necessary part
of the conversation.


364
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,666 line:79% position:50% size:70%
We're really talking about
life and death issues there.


365
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,666 line:79% position:50% size:55%
I mean, we can put in
place all kinds of new


366
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,200 line:79% position:50% size:45%
structures, change
attitudes, make


367
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,799 line:79% position:50% size:60%
opportunities available,
but you need to have


368
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:50,266 line:79% position:50% size:63%
people live and live in a
way that enables them to


369
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,466 line:79% position:50% size:58%
use the God-given
talents that they have.


370
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:55,566 line:79% position:50% size:65%
I mean, we have seen, you
know, the negative impacts


371
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:59,066 line:79% position:50% size:58%
of environmental racism
shortening lives,


372
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:03,666 line:79% position:50% size:65%
negatively impacting
lives, curtailing peoples'


373
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:08,566 line:79% position:50% size:65%
ability to reach all that
they are capable of doing.


374
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,066 line:79% position:50% size:65%
Environmental racism is
something that I think for


375
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:13,633 line:79% position:50% size:53%
too long has not
been front and center


376
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700 line:85% position:50% size:40%
and needs to be.


377
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,966 line:79% position:50% size:55%
I mean, it has to be
because you're talking


378
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:20,766 line:79% position:50% size:65%
about you know, the way
in which a society treats,


379
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,399 line:85% position:50% size:53%
you know, its people.


380
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:26,100 line:79% position:50% size:60%
And locating things next
to communities of color


381
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,933 line:79% position:50% size:65%
that are going to cause
high rates of cancer, high


382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,200 line:79% position:50% size:65%
rates of asthma, you know,
the kinds of things that


383
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:36,433 line:79% position:50% size:48%
curtail, again,
peoples' abilities.


384
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,600 line:79% position:50% size:55%
These are the kinds of
things that people in


385
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,133 line:79% position:50% size:65%
government have to stop,
that societies have to say


386
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,566 line:79% position:50% size:63%
this is unacceptable, and
we have to be, I think,


387
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:48,866 line:79% position:50% size:65%
more conscious of our
environment and the impact


388
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:52,233 line:79% position:50% size:53%
that environment has
on all of our people.


389
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:53,166 line:85% position:50% size:65%
>> LISA JACKSON: So agree.


390
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:56,166 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I even like to point out
to younger people, even


391
00:16:56,233 --> 00:17:00,033 line:79% position:50% size:63%
the roads we're driving
on oftentimes cut a swath


392
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,299 line:79% position:50% size:65%
right through the heart of
Black prosperity and the


393
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:04,165 line:85% position:50% size:40%
Black community.


394
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,400 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I grew up in New Orleans
where Claiborne Avenue


395
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:08,665 line:79% position:50% size:43%
became an
underpass, right?


396
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:11,366 line:85% position:50% size:63%
And it has a huge impact.


397
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,200 line:85% position:50% size:40%
So, New Orleans.


398
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:13,733 line:79% position:50% size:43%
I'm also going to
talk about music.


399
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,532 line:85% position:50% size:60%
It is Black Music Month.


400
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:21,333 line:79% position:50% size:48%
I know music is in
your blood as well.


401
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,333 line:79% position:50% size:48%
We just celebrated
Friday, Juneteenth.


402
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,799 line:79% position:50% size:58%
We talked about Black
music as the soundtrack


403
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:33,500 line:79% position:50% size:60%
for protest and you're
no stranger to protests.


404
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:35,633 line:79% position:50% size:60%
You were even on the
ground with activists in


405
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,500 line:85% position:50% size:48%
Ferguson, Missouri.


406
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:39,566 line:79% position:50% size:45%
What has been the
soundtrack of your


407
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:40,866 line:79% position:50% size:43%
struggles through
the years?


408
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,666 line:79% position:50% size:58%
And follow-up question;
what's the music that's


409
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:46,599 line:85% position:50% size:65%
giving you life right now?


410
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,466 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> ERIC HOLDER: Well, when
I think about protests and


411
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:51,833 line:79% position:50% size:48%
music that I like,
there is one album.


412
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,866 line:79% position:50% size:58%
What's Going On,
Marvin Gaye, 1971-1972.


413
00:17:56,933 --> 00:18:00,466 line:85% position:50% size:65%
It was a great album then.


414
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:02,799 line:79% position:50% size:70%
I think it's the greatest
album that's ever been made.


415
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:05,366 line:79% position:50% size:65%
With, you know, all due
respect to the Beatles and


416
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:06,966 line:85% position:50% size:35%
other artists.


417
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:09,966 line:79% position:50% size:60%
It was great back in the
early 70's and it still


418
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:12,466 line:79% position:50% size:40%
resonates in the
21st Century.


419
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,366 line:85% position:50% size:65%
You know, What's Going On.


420
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:17,966 line:79% position:50% size:63%
You listen to Marvin sing
in that song, over the


421
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,566 line:79% position:50% size:70%
course of that whole
album, you know, both sides.


422
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,033 line:79% position:50% size:53%
It's - he talks about
the problems that he


423
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:26,466 line:79% position:50% size:65%
confronted, his brother
confronted in Vietnam, but


424
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:29,000 line:79% position:50% size:60%
it speaks also to
issues that we have here


425
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,766 line:85% position:50% size:50%
in the 21st Century.


426
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,033 line:79% position:50% size:53%
You know, and so, I
still listen to that.


427
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:34,566 line:85% position:50% size:45%
I still love that.


428
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:35,700 line:79% position:50% size:45%
But now, you know,
it's interesting.


429
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,599 line:79% position:50% size:48%
You know, what am
I listening to now?


430
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:41,866 line:79% position:50% size:65%
I mean, 21st Century, this
is a turbulent time and I


431
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:44,366 line:79% position:50% size:65%
look for peace in my music
and so I've gone back.


432
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,433 line:79% position:50% size:48%
I'm kind of hanging
out in the 70's.


433
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,099 line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, Marvin Gaye, Luther
Vandross, Aretha Franklin,


434
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,833 line:79% position:50% size:53%
Earth, Wind, and
Fire, the Stylistics.


435
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,266 line:79% position:50% size:45%
All - this is the
music of my youth.


436
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,666 line:79% position:50% size:63%
A turbulent time but a
time that we got through,


437
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:02,066 line:79% position:50% size:65%
a time that gives me hope,
makes me think that you


438
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:05,200 line:79% position:50% size:63%
know, as turbulent as the
late 60's and early 70's


439
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:08,866 line:79% position:50% size:73%
were, we got through it
and we made a better America.


440
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:11,099 line:79% position:50% size:60%
We have turbulent times
now in the early part of


441
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,900 line:79% position:50% size:68%
the 21st Century and again,
I'm cautiously optimistic.


442
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:16,766 line:79% position:50% size:63%
I think we'll get through
it again and music helps


443
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,900 line:85% position:50% size:55%
me have that optimism.


444
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,299 line:79% position:50% size:40%
>> LISA JACKSON:
Yeah. Me too.


445
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:24,166 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I'm going to bump Living
Just Enough for the City


446
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:25,666 line:85% position:50% size:60%
up on that playlist too.


447
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,599 line:85% position:50% size:60%
I always - Innervisions.


448
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,066 line:79% position:50% size:63%
I think that's the reason
I actually became an


449
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,566 line:79% position:50% size:63%
environmentalist,
listening to the story of


450
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:36,733 line:79% position:50% size:60%
this brother getting off
the bus in New York and


451
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,700 line:79% position:50% size:73%
what happened to him, you
know, in those decades after.


452
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:41,833 line:79% position:50% size:60%
>> ERIC HOLDER: If you
look at What's Going On,


453
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,733 line:79% position:50% size:73%
you've got to remember
Mercy, Mercy Me, the Ecology.


454
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,633 line:79% position:50% size:55%
I mean, Marvin covered
everything, you know?


455
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,099 line:79% position:50% size:60%
He covered protests,
demonstrations, Vietnam,


456
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,366 line:85% position:50% size:30%
the Ecology.


457
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:52,333 line:79% position:50% size:35%
It's a - it's
a masterpiece.


458
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,733 line:79% position:50% size:40%
>> LISA JACKSON:
It is. It is.


459
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:56,599 line:79% position:50% size:58%
Alright, let me take it
to the tech community.


460
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,966 line:79% position:50% size:63%
This is a wonderful
audience listening to us,


461
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:04,133 line:79% position:50% size:60%
dynamic, talented
developers who - who are


462
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,599 line:79% position:50% size:63%
interested in this fight,
interested in the fight


463
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,799 line:79% position:50% size:65%
for change, and I've heard
from so many people across


464
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:13,066 line:79% position:50% size:60%
Apple, throughout our
network, who are looking


465
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,166 line:85% position:50% size:43%
for ways to help.


466
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:18,033 line:79% position:50% size:60%
What are some ways that
tech and developers, app


467
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:21,099 line:79% position:50% size:63%
developers specifically,
can help tackle racism in


468
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,166 line:79% position:50% size:45%
the work that
they do every day?


469
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:25,833 line:79% position:50% size:60%
>> ERIC HOLDER: Well,
tell you, you know, this


470
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,966 line:79% position:50% size:60%
is an unbelievably
creative community and I


471
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:31,266 line:79% position:50% size:55%
think using the skills
that you have to - to


472
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,900 line:79% position:50% size:65%
aggregate, to massage, to
work with data and then to


473
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:38,700 line:79% position:50% size:65%
share information, I think
that's - I mean, that's


474
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:40,900 line:79% position:50% size:55%
the core of what it is
that developers do, I


475
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:43,833 line:79% position:50% size:63%
think, at their best, you
know, simplifying things,


476
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,799 line:79% position:50% size:68%
making things accessible
to people around the world.


477
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:49,333 line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, I would say that you
know, I am not as creative


478
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,766 line:79% position:50% size:65%
nor technically proficient
as people are in this


479
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:57,000 line:79% position:50% size:63%
audience, but using those
- those skills, those


480
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:00,433 line:79% position:50% size:65%
really special skills to
come up with ways in which


481
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,133 line:79% position:50% size:60%
you make available to
people the possibilities


482
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,900 line:79% position:50% size:63%
that they have,
opportunities with regard


483
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,099 line:79% position:50% size:50%
to how they can make
their lives better,


484
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,966 line:79% position:50% size:65%
opportunities in which
they can you know, monitor


485
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,833 line:79% position:50% size:65%
things that are being done
in their societies, ways


486
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,266 line:79% position:50% size:73%
in which the information
can be shared across borders.


487
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,633 line:79% position:50% size:60%
This is all the kinds of
stuff that you all do so


488
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,599 line:85% position:50% size:38%
extremely well.


489
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,900 line:79% position:50% size:63%
I would ask you to think,
you know, about maybe


490
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:30,299 line:79% position:50% size:60%
turning your focus from
the things that are more


491
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:33,799 line:79% position:50% size:63%
traditionally have been
expected of you and think


492
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:36,799 line:79% position:50% size:58%
about new ways that you
can look at this, this


493
00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:40,033 line:79% position:50% size:58%
other frontier, this
racial frontier that is


494
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,799 line:79% position:50% size:55%
not only in the United
States but in other


495
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:44,233 line:79% position:50% size:63%
countries as well, and
think about ways in which


496
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:47,733 line:79% position:50% size:60%
you can focus that
creativity, those skills


497
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:53,299 line:79% position:50% size:58%
on this problem of
race and ethnic strife.


498
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:56,799 line:79% position:50% size:63%
What are the things that
you can do there that can


499
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:58,799 line:85% position:50% size:63%
alleviate those problems?


500
00:21:58,866 --> 00:21:59,766 line:85% position:50% size:53%
I'm really confident.


501
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,533 line:79% position:50% size:60%
Again, if this community
focuses on those issues,


502
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,599 line:79% position:50% size:63%
coupled with great
companies like Apple, you


503
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,266 line:79% position:50% size:63%
all could have a really
meaningful impact for the


504
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:13,633 line:79% position:50% size:60%
good on the issues that
we have been discussing.


505
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,500 line:85% position:50% size:63%
>> LISA JACKSON: Alright.


506
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,166 line:85% position:50% size:45%
We will take that.


507
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:18,966 line:79% position:50% size:65%
Eric, it is always such an
honor to talk to you, such


508
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,566 line:79% position:50% size:63%
time well spent,
so much to take away from


509
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,166 line:85% position:50% size:45%
our time together.


510
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,433 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I just want to thank you
so much for joining us,


511
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,833 line:79% position:50% size:63%
for all you do, for all
you've been in service to


512
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,400 line:85% position:50% size:65%
equality to our community.


513
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:34,700 line:85% position:50% size:50%
Just huge thank you.


514
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:36,833 line:79% position:50% size:50%
And thanks to all of
you for tuning in.


515
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,966 line:85% position:50% size:65%
Enjoy the rest of Dub-Dub.
