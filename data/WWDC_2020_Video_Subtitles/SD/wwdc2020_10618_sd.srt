00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:07,074 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,678 line:0
Hi, I'm Ally. I'm the engineering
program manager for Game Center.


3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,715 line:0
I'm super excited to talk to you
about not only what's new,


4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,351 line:0
but to also walk you through
some updates to existing features


5
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,887 line:0
that we think you and your players
are really gonna love.


6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,154 line:-1
Throughout both sessions,


7
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,390 line:-2
we'll touch on all the core features
of Game Center.


8
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:26,226 line:-2
At the end, we hope you walk away
equipped with the tools you need


9
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,762 line:-1
to add Game Center support to your game.


10
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,397 line:-1
But before we get to details,


11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,033 line:-2
let's take a minute
to talk about what Game Center is


12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,902 line:-1
and what it offers you and your players.


13
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,038 line:-2
Game Center
is Apple's own social gaming network.


14
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:41,942 line:-2
It offers a single identity for players
to use across all their games.


15
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,044 line:-2
And once signed in,
they can instantly access


16
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,812 line:-1
their Game Center network of friends.


17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,947 line:-1
As a developer,


18
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:50,584 line:-2
you can implement as many or as few
Game Center features as you'd like.


19
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,953 line:-2
It's really about
what makes sense for your game.


20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,256 line:-2
Leaderboards are a good place to start
if you're new to Game Center.


21
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,859 line:-2
They let your players see
how they stack up against friends


22
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,494 line:-1
and other global players.


23
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,031 line:-2
And as players progress through your game,
why not reward them along the way?


24
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:06,934 line:-2
Achievements are a great mechanism
to do just that.


25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,970 line:-2
They also encourage players
to come back and keep playing.


26
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,372 line:0
And if your game is more fun
when played with others,


27
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,176 line:0
you can also use Game Center
to create rich multiplayer experiences.


28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,215 line:-2
Most of Game Center's functionality can be
added within your own custom-built UI.


29
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,951 line:-2
Or you can take advantage
of the native Game Center offering,


30
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,286 line:-2
which has been completely refreshed
this year.


31
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,121 line:-2
That's what I'd like
to walk you through now.


32
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,290 line:-1
To do that, let's jump into a game.


33
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,827 line:-2
Upon launch, the Game Center
welcome banner will still appear.


34
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,396 line:-2
But once it rolls away,
a new element appears.


35
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,699 line:-1
This is the Game Center Access Point.


36
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,767 line:-1
At a glance, I see some useful highlights,


37
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,137 line:-2
like how many achievements I've earned
and where I stand in the leaderboards,


38
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,507 line:-1
all without any action on my part.


39
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,509 line:-1
Once the highlights finish displaying,


40
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,445 line:-2
the Access Point collapses
into my player avatar.


41
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,847 line:-2
This element is meant
to remain on your title screen


42
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,450 line:-2
as a consistent way
for players to access Game Center.


43
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,453 line:-2
To add Access Point functionality
within your game


44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,922 line:-1
you'll need to adopt the Access Point API.


45
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,424 line:-2
This lets you choose
what corner to position it in


46
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,327 line:-2
and whether or not you want to display
highlights to the player.


47
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,764 line:-2
Christy will cover Access Point
implementation in depth a little later.


48
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,300 line:-2
But for now,
let's tap on my player avatar.


49
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,904 line:-1
This takes me to the in-game dashboard--


50
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,941 line:-2
a centralized location for players
to browse and interact with Game Center.


51
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,644 line:-2
From here you have quick access
to existing features,


52
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,646 line:-1
like Leaderboards and Achievements.


53
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,614 line:-1
But as you've probably already noticed,


54
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,250 line:-2
the biggest change is
the addition of a new section


55
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,987 line:-2
that offers in-game access
to your Game Center player profile.


56
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,389 line:-1
But before we dig into that,


57
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,759 line:-2
let's talk about the main dashboard
for just another second.


58
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,795 line:-2
To give your players access
to the top-level dashboard,


59
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,864 line:-1
you can adopt the Dashboard API.


60
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:47,634 line:-2
Your player will then be able to choose
what section they want to explore.


61
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,104 line:-2
If you already link to specific sections
of the dashboard in your game,


62
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,640 line:-2
don't worry--
those will continue to work as well.


63
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,210 line:-2
For example,
if you link to an individual leaderboard


64
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,678 line:-1
somewhere within your UI,


65
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,980 line:-1
we'll still take you directly to it.


66
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:03,717 line:-2
Top-level highlights within the dashboard
are also new in iOS 14.


67
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,319 line:-1
These are little bits of information


68
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,021 line:-2
that are meant
to offer useful stats at a glance.


69
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:11,091 line:-2
You'll see similar highlights
throughout each section of the dashboard,


70
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,860 line:-1
so let's continue to drill in.


71
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,396 line:-2
Tapping on the first section
of the dashboard


72
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,599 line:-1
brings me to my own player profile.


73
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:22,202 line:-2
Right away I get some useful stats
about my overall game play.


74
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,171 line:-1
I can view and edit my friends list


75
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,974 line:-2
or see a list of players
I've recently been matched with.


76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,710 line:-2
I'm also offered
some friend suggestions here.


77
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,078 line:-1
And if I see one I like,


78
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,114 line:-2
I can tap on "invite"
and send that person a friend request.


79
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,950 line:-2
All of this can be done
without having to leave the game.


80
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,252 line:-1
Scrolling further,


81
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,755 line:-2
I now have a way to view the achievements
I've earned across all my games.


82
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:45,759 line:-2
And if I want to change something within
my profile, like my nickname or avatar,


83
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,694 line:-1
I could tap on Profile Settings.


84
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:51,265 line:-2
I'm pretty happy with my profile, though,
so let's go back to the dashboard.


85
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,102 line:-1
Next up is Achievements.


86
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,639 line:-2
Right away, I'm greeted by
the achievements I've already completed.


87
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,042 line:-2
This is a great way to let the player feel
a sense of accomplishment.


88
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,377 line:-1
Scrolling a little further,


89
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,379 line:-2
here are the achievements
I've yet to earn.


90
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,981 line:-2
And if the game has implemented
in-progress achievements,


91
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:11,652 line:-2
like this one has,
I can tell how close I am to earning it.


92
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,589 line:-2
Notice that the artwork you choose to use
for achievements is prominently displayed.


93
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,659 line:-2
We'd encourage you to check out
the "Design for Game Center" session


94
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,494 line:-1
as well the Human Interface Guidelines


95
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,896 line:-2
for guidance on how to create
great achievement art.


96
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,165 line:-1
Both will cover best practices


97
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,835 line:-2
for creating all kinds of assets
for your game.


98
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,737 line:-2
And later on, Dersu will walk you through
exactly how to set up


99
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,840 line:-2
different kinds of achievements
within your game.


100
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,741 line:-1
Let's move on to Leaderboards.


101
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,744 line:-2
Just like achievements, the artwork
associated with your leaderboards


102
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,246 line:-1
is now the center of attention.


103
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,416 line:-2
So it's a great idea to use
different assets for each one.


104
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,219 line:-2
This is an opportunity to help the player
better recognize


105
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,154 line:-1
which leaderboard they're looking for.


106
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,489 line:-2
The design session I referenced
just a second ago


107
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,759 line:-2
also has details
on creating great leaderboard art.


108
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,795 line:-1
Tapping into an individual leaderboard,


109
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,830 line:-2
the most obvious difference
is the addition


110
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,565 line:-1
of a friends-only leaderboard.


111
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,101 line:-2
This is now the default
and makes it much easier


112
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,704 line:-2
for players to see
how they rank amongst their friends.


113
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,240 line:-2
I could also view global
and recent leaderboards if I want


114
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,808 line:-1
by changing views at the top.


115
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,743 line:-1
But while we're on the topic of friends,


116
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,145 line:-2
I can also tap on a friend
within a leaderboard.


117
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,881 line:-1
This brings up their player card.


118
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,216 line:-2
And if that friend has chosen
to share their info,


119
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:20,020 line:-2
I can see what they've recently played
as well as their achievement progress.


120
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:23,457 line:-2
The best part is player cards are
accessible in lots of new places.


121
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,959 line:-2
I can see this same information
in my friends list


122
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:30,063 line:-2
and even while browsing the App Store,
which we'll talk more about in just a bit.


123
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,532 line:-1
Returning to the leaderboard,


124
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,968 line:-2
perhaps the largest change is the option
to create a recurring leaderboard.


125
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,237 line:-2
This leaderboard is set to recur
every 15 minutes,


126
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,439 line:-1
and I'm currently only in fourth place.


127
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,408 line:-1
That's okay-- scores will reset shortly,


128
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,911 line:-2
and I'll have another chance
to come out on top.


129
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:47,080 line:-2
Notice that I can see my standing
not only in the current leaderboard,


130
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,483 line:-2
but in the last iteration
I played in as well.


131
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,219 line:-2
Recurring leaderboards can be set up
within App Store Connect,


132
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,921 line:-1
similar to classic leaderboards.


133
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:57,357 line:-2
Later on, Udayan will be walking you
through how to configure both types.


134
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,194 line:-1
Returning to the dashboard one last time,


135
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,896 line:-2
the final section to check out
is actually an optional one,


136
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,565 line:-1
and that's Challenges.


137
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,968 line:-2
We only made one change this year,
but it's one worth calling out.


138
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:12,239 line:-2
The Challenges feature now lives behind a
new opt-in flag within App Store Connect.


139
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,307 line:-1
By default,


140
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,643 line:-2
the Challenges section of the dashboard
will not appear within your game.


141
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,779 line:-1
However, if this is a feature you support


142
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,415 line:-2
and would like your players
to continue to have access to,


143
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,117 line:-2
simply check a box in App Store Connect
and you're good to go.


144
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,956 line:-2
Now, let's move on to a different area
of Game Center, and that's multiplayer.


145
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,591 line:-1
Game Center can be used to create


146
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,961 line:-2
both real-time and turn-based
multiplayer experiences.


147
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:38,031 line:-2
During implementation, you can choose
the one that fits best within your game.


148
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,935 line:-2
The other choice to make is whether
you want to use your own multiplayer UI


149
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,770 line:-1
or the default Game Center one.


150
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,640 line:-2
To help you decide, let's take a look
at the native experience.


151
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,111 line:-2
Choosing the multiplayer option
from the main menu brings up the new UI.


152
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:54,748 line:-2
As you can tell, the colors of
the game underneath really show through.


153
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,751 line:-2
This is meant to make the design
feel at home within any game


154
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,087 line:-2
with no additional work
from the developer.


155
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,356 line:-2
Now let's set up a game
the way a player would.


156
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,325 line:-2
At the top, I can adjust
how many players I want to add


157
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,628 line:-1
up to the developer-specified limit.


158
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,197 line:-1
For this example, let's choose three.


159
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,666 line:-2
Within each slot,
I can tap on "Add Player."


160
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,501 line:-1
This will bring up the player picker.


161
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,137 line:-2
This is where I choose
the people I want to play with.


162
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:20,140 line:-2
If nearby players exist,
they'll appear at the top.


163
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,942 line:-1
Or what I tend to do most often--


164
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,878 line:-2
I can choose to play
with an existing Game Center friend.


165
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,282 line:-2
We'll also offer suggestions based
on people you've recently played with


166
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,651 line:-1
or recently contacted on your device.


167
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,152 line:-1
Coming back to the main screen,


168
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:35,189 line:-2
I don't have to fill all these
player slots in if I don't want to.


169
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,292 line:-2
Any slots I leave blank
will automatically be auto-matched.


170
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,027 line:-1
And now I'm ready to start the game.


171
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,528 line:-1
Look how easy that was.


172
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,598 line:-2
No join codes, no friction--
just set up and play.


173
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,034 line:-2
And that's a quick overview
of the new multiplayer UI.


174
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,903 line:-2
A little later on, Christy will
walk you through in more detail.


175
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,040 line:-2
Now that you've seen an overview
of what Game Center has to offer,


176
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,242 line:-2
I want to spend
just a few minutes talking about


177
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:59,112 line:-2
some new ways we think Game Center
can help players discover new content.


178
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:02,216 line:-2
And there's no better place to start
than within the App Store.


179
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,818 line:-2
Now, when browsing popular areas
of the store,


180
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,553 line:-1
like the Arcade and Games tabs,


181
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,723 line:-2
players can better discover what
their Game Center friends are playing.


182
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,792 line:-2
We're also integrating
this same information


183
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,694 line:-1
right into your game's product page.


184
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,264 line:-2
I can even view a friend's player card
right within the App Store.


185
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,234 line:-2
From there, I can check out
more of their recently played games


186
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,070 line:-2
and download any of the ones
that look interesting to me.


187
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,306 line:-2
We think this will give players
a convenient way to discover new games


188
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,941 line:-1
they may have otherwise missed.


189
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,945 line:-1
Now, let's start diving into details.


190
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,616 line:-2
Here's a look at how
the rest of the sessions will break down.


191
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,818 line:-2
To get started,
Udayan is going to show you


192
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,488 line:-2
how to implement the Dashboard API
within your game.


193
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:46,260 line:-2
After that, Christy will cover
adding Access Point functionality...


194
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,029 line:-1
followed by players and friends,


195
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,732 line:-2
where Jon will show you
not only how to enable Game Center,


196
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,202 line:-2
but also how to properly interact
with the local player and more.


197
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,538 line:-2
And this will bring the first session
to a close.


198
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,908 line:-2
To kick off part two,
Udayan will be returning to show you


199
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,777 line:-2
how to set up
both classic and recurring leaderboards.


200
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,747 line:-1
In the achievements section,


201
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:10,617 line:-2
Dersu will walk you through the different
types of achievements, how to set them up,


202
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,020 line:-2
and how to ensure
they're reported accurately.


203
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,758 line:-2
Finally, Christy will talk about
multiplayer functionality


204
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,092 line:-1
and what's new there.


205
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,430 line:-2
But to get you started with Dashboard,
I'd like to now turn it over to Udayan.


206
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,567 line:0
Thank you, Ally, and hello, everyone.


207
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,903 line:0
My name is Udayan Kale.
I'm on the Game Center engineering team.


208
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,238 line:0
In this part of the session,


209
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,807 line:0
we will take a deeper look
at the Game Center dashboard.


210
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,377 line:0
Ally just showed you
the new Game Center dashboard.


211
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,013 line:-2
I will now show you ways
to invoke the main dashboard


212
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,783 line:-2
and each dashboard section
from within your game.


213
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,019 line:-2
The new Game Center dashboard
is a consistent, one-stop UI


214
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,788 line:-1
for many Game Center features.


215
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:51,024 line:-2
It allows you to access
the local player's profile, leaderboards,


216
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,860 line:-1
achievements and challenges.


217
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,561 line:-1
All these features are provided to you


218
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:57,798 line:-2
through the familiar
GKGameCenterViewController class.


219
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,400 line:-1
Here is an example of using the dashboard.


220
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,070 line:-2
It uses the same
GKGameCenterViewController class


221
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,771 line:-1
that you are probably using today.


222
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,508 line:-2
The main difference
is how you initialize it.


223
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,711 line:-2
For most games, we recommend
using the main dashboard view.


224
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,547 line:-2
You can see here,
when I initialize the view controller,


225
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,682 line:-1
I'm specifying the dashboard state.


226
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,685 line:-2
This gives you the main view
that you see here on the right.


227
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:22,656 line:-2
Another option is to go directly
to a specific section of the dashboard.


228
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:26,093 line:-2
You can go right into the leaderboards,
achievements, challenges


229
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,861 line:-1
or the local player's profile.


230
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,633 line:-2
All you need to do
is set the state to the one you want.


231
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,035 line:-1
So here is the Achievements section.


232
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,371 line:-2
You can see I have earned
three achievements so far,


233
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,741 line:-2
and I can browse through the achievements
to see which ones are remaining.


234
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:44,545 line:-2
Or here, I have chosen to go
straight to the player profile view.


235
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,014 line:-2
I can look at friends,
people I have played with,


236
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,016 line:-1
and access my profile settings.


237
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,884 line:-1
All of this is up to you.


238
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:54,154 line:-2
You can also deep-link
directly to a specific leaderboard.


239
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,557 line:-2
For this, you just provide
the leaderboardID


240
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,359 line:-2
along with the playerScope,
global or friends,


241
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,095 line:-2
and the timeScope,
all time, this week or today,


242
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,764 line:-1
and present the view controller.


243
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,100 line:-2
And regardless of which section
you start them in,


244
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,671 line:-2
your players will be able to navigate
to any available section on their own.


245
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:14,107 line:-2
So that's all it takes
to adopt the new dashboard.


246
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,744 line:-2
We wanted to make it easy for you
to move your apps onto this right away.


247
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,746 line:-1
Now let's talk about the new Access Point.


248
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,950 line:-2
And for that, let me welcome Christy.
Thank you.


249
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,419 line:0
Thank you, Udayan.


250
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,387 line:0
Today I want to talk about Access Point--


251
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,958 line:0
a great new way to let your players view
and manage their Game Center data


252
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,359 line:0
right within the game.


253
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,094 line:-1
As you can see,


254
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,331 line:-2
there is now a small button
in the upper left with your avatar in it.


255
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:41,134 line:-2
Tapping this button will take the user
to the in-game dashboard.


256
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,671 line:-2
This button can be placed
in any corner that you choose.


257
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,808 line:-2
Additionally,
there are options to show highlights,


258
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,110 line:-2
including the number
of achievements earned


259
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,513 line:-1
or your rank on the default leaderboard.


260
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,850 line:-2
Ally has already showed you what this
looks like from the player perspective,


261
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:01,121 line:-2
so now let's take a look at how to adopt
Access Point within your game.


262
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,858 line:-2
So first,
I will cover some configuration options


263
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,794 line:-2
that let you specify position,
content and so forth.


264
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,498 line:-2
Then I will talk to you
about how to display Access Point


265
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,268 line:-1
as well as some behaviors around this.


266
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,803 line:-2
Next, there are some properties
you can observe


267
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,241 line:-2
to know when you are presenting
Game Center and to adjust your layout.


268
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,509 line:-1
And finally,


269
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:26,547 line:-2
we will cover some considerations
for Apple TV and game controllers


270
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,449 line:-2
and how to trigger the Access Point
programmatically.


271
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,686 line:-1
So, let's talk about positioning.


272
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,957 line:-2
By default,
Access Point is placed in Top Leading,


273
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:39,092 line:-1
which is the upper-left corner.


274
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,229 line:-1
However, Access Point is flexible,


275
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,565 line:-2
so you can place it
in any corner of the screen


276
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,800 line:-1
that best suits your game's UI.


277
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,970 line:0
The positioning of Access Point
will depend on your language setting.


278
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:55,509 line:-2
So in languages like Arabic and Hebrew,
Top Leading will appear on the top right,


279
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,711 line:-1
Top Trailing on the upper left,


280
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,315 line:0
and so forth on the bottom
from right to left.


281
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,519 line:-2
Access Point allows you to choose
which highlights you wish to display.


282
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:10,023 line:-2
You can choose to show just the avatar
or show highlights,


283
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,426 line:0
including the number of achievements
you've earned


284
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,195 line:0
or your rank on the default leaderboard.


285
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,465 line:-2
So here's how to configure
and show the Access Point.


286
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:21,735 line:-2
Typically you want to display Access Point
while you're on your main menu.


287
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:25,672 line:-2
So first,
I want to set the location to be top left.


288
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,308 line:-2
Now, I set Access Point
to showHighlights,


289
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,813 line:-2
and finally, I set isActive to be true
in order to activate it.


290
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,817 line:-2
Please notice that all of these calls
are to a shared singleton


291
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,619 line:-1
off of GKAccessPoint.


292
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,588 line:-1
As I just showed in the code,


293
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,624 line:-2
we recommend
that you show your Access Point


294
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,492 line:-1
when presenting your main menu.


295
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,730 line:0
You should hide the Access Point
in situations like cinematic intros,


296
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,499 line:0
game play or your Settings screen.


297
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,202 line:0
Our design team
has put together some best practices


298
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,872 line:0
for when to show and hide Access Point,
so I suggest you check that out.


299
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:03,510 line:-2
Now, if the player taps Access Point,
they will be taken into the dashboard.


300
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:04,912 line:-1
While that is happening,


301
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:08,115 line:-2
you may wish to pause
your menu animations or whatever.


302
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:11,485 line:-2
We provide a property,
isPresentingGameCenter,


303
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,053 line:-1
that you can use for this.


304
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,590 line:-2
So here, I'm setting up an observer
to keep an eye on that.


305
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:20,727 line:-2
And based on this property,
I'll pause or un-pause my game.


306
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:26,300 line:-2
In this case, the Access Point
overlaps the moon in our sample app.


307
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,237 line:-2
So we provide a property,
frameInScreenCoordinates,


308
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,973 line:-2
which can be used to adjust
the layout of your UI.


309
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:38,145 line:-2
In this case, we use the frame
to shift the artwork out of the way.


310
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,947 line:-1
This can also be observed


311
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,050 line:-2
as the Access Point progresses
through each of its highlights.


312
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,954 line:-2
Let's show you
what this looks like in code.


313
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,990 line:-2
Here I am observing the property,
and when a change happens,


314
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,092 line:-1
I grab the frame from our singleton,


315
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,896 line:-2
convert it to my view's local coordinates
and adjust the layout.


316
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,031 line:-2
Another use
for frameInScreenCoordinates


317
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,867 line:-1
is for games using controllers


318
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:03,136 line:-2
or on Apple TV
where you track the remote directly.


319
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:07,241 line:-2
As you can see, as the user navigates
through the menu of our game,


320
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,776 line:-1
the game draws its own custom feedback.


321
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:12,079 line:-2
Here you can use
frameInScreenCoordinates


322
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,413 line:-1
to draw focus feedback


323
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,350 line:-2
when the user navigates
to the area behind the Access Point.


324
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,819 line:-1
Here's what this looks like in code.


325
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,888 line:-2
The first part's similar
to our previous code


326
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,223 line:-2
where we get the screenFrame
for the Access Point


327
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,192 line:-1
and convert it to myView coordinates.


328
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,729 line:-2
Then I toggle focusFeedback
based on whether or not


329
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,598 line:-2
the tracking position
is inside the frame of the Access Point.


330
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:34,301 line:-2
To finish this,
we need to do one more thing.


331
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:37,271 line:-2
When the user selects
the accessPointElement,


332
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,807 line:-2
they call our programmatic API,
triggerAccessPoint,


333
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:42,142 line:-1
to show the dashboard.


334
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:45,312 line:-2
In closing,
I've given a quick tour of Access Point


335
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,414 line:-2
and gone through the API
used for adoption,


336
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,983 line:0
including configuration, activation,


337
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,854 line:0
observable properties
and programmatic activation.


338
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:56,423 line:-2
Now let's hand it off
to Jonathan Ellenbogen.


339
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:00,561 line:0
Thanks, Christy. I'm Jonathan Ellenbogen.
I'm on the App Store team.


340
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,663 line:0
I'm going to talk to you
about players, friends,


341
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,331 line:0
and getting started with Game Center.


342
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,167 line:0
Let's start with players.


343
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:11,038 line:-2
Just like in a game,
Game Center refers to users as players.


344
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,941 line:-2
Game Center uses players
to track scores, achievements,


345
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,376 line:-2
build leaderboards
and start multiplayer games.


346
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,082 line:-2
Players have one avatar and nickname
that is used across all Game Center games.


347
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,719 line:-2
This gives your users a consistent
and familiar look right from the start,


348
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,121 line:-2
which is good
for both users and developers,


349
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:31,024 line:-2
saving you the time and trouble
of implementing this yourself.


350
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:35,329 line:-2
The fact that players
have just one account


351
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,265 line:-2
means they only need to sign in
once per device,


352
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,567 line:-2
and can start playing your game
even faster.


353
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,238 line:-2
And this year, with all the new
redesigned Game Center features,


354
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,006 line:-1
players are more accessible than ever.


355
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,941 line:-1
From leaderboards to friends lists,


356
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:51,812 line:-2
users can access player profiles
for themselves and their friends.


357
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,947 line:-2
Before using Game Center
for the first time,


358
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,616 line:-1
users will create a single account


359
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,952 line:-2
which will identify them
across all Game Center games.


360
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,055 line:-2
In code, players are represented
by two different classes--


361
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,191 line:-1
GKLocalPlayer and GKPlayer.


362
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,627 line:-1
A great way to think about these classes


363
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,731 line:-2
is that the GKLocalPlayer
is the user playing your game,


364
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,566 line:-1
while GKPlayers are everyone else.


365
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:14,300 line:-1
Let's take a quick look and compare.


366
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,304 line:-2
All players will have
an avatar and a nickname.


367
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:20,339 line:-2
Both types of players
will also have scoped playerIDs,


368
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,644 line:-2
which can be used for leaderboards,
game invites and challenges.


369
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,180 line:-2
However, the local player
will have a persistent ID,


370
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:30,250 line:-2
while GKPlayers have IDs that change
with every instantiation of your game.


371
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,386 line:-2
Since the local player is used
to represent


372
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,989 line:-2
the player that's currently signed in,
some additional information is needed.


373
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,226 line:-2
The local player class exposes information
related to restrictions


374
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:41,562 line:-1
which may need to be applied in your game.


375
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,031 line:-2
The local player is also used
by Game Center services


376
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:47,134 line:-2
to save states such as scores,
achievements and friends.


377
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:50,470 line:-2
Now let's look at how you can start
using players in your game.


378
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,940 line:-2
First, before we start
using players directly,


379
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,541 line:-1
you'll need to enable Game Center.


380
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:58,579 line:-2
To do this, add Game Center
as a capability in your Xcode project.


381
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,281 line:-2
You'll also need to enable Game Center
in App Store Connect.


382
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,784 line:-2
This is done in the Features section
under Game Center.


383
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:06,720 line:-2
You'll be prompted to enable Game Center
if you haven't already.


384
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:11,158 line:-2
After Game Center has been enabled
in Xcode and App Store Connect,


385
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:13,227 line:-2
you'll need to authenticate
the local player


386
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,230 line:-1
before accessing any Game Center APIs.


387
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,900 line:-2
Authentication allows Game Center to
make sure there's a signed-in local player


388
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,069 line:-2
and that the Game Center account
is ready to use.


389
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,005 line:-2
Authentication also checks
whether your game has been configured


390
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:28,675 line:-2
to make Game Center API calls
and talk to Game Center services.


391
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:31,812 line:-2
Once authenticated, you'll be able
to turn on Game Center features


392
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:34,515 line:-2
and receive notifications
such as game invites,


393
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,617 line:-1
challenges and user changes.


394
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:39,353 line:-2
Let's look at how authentication works
in your game.


395
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,390 line:-2
Authenticating the local player
should be done


396
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,692 line:-2
as early as possible
in the life cycle of your game.


397
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,128 line:-2
This ensures your game is ready
to receive notifications


398
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,097 line:-1
and make Game Center API calls.


399
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,499 line:-2
First, you'll need to set
the authentication handler


400
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,335 line:-1
on the shared instance of GKLocalPlayer.


401
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:58,105 line:-2
This will kick off Game Center
authentication automatically,


402
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:01,341 line:-2
and you'll receive callbacks when
authentication-related changes happen,


403
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,976 line:-1
and you can respond accordingly.


404
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:07,481 line:-2
It's likely that the local player
will have already been signed in.


405
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:08,615 line:-1
In this case,


406
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:12,753 line:-2
the authentication handler will be called
without any errors or UI to present,


407
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,323 line:-2
which means you've successfully
authenticated and are ready to go.


408
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,093 line:-2
There will also be cases where the player
hasn't yet authenticated with Game Center.


409
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,095 line:-1
In these cases,


410
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:25,599 line:-2
your authentication handler will be called
with a error and a view controller.


411
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,668 line:-2
Your app should present
this view controller,


412
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:31,271 line:-2
giving the user a chance to sign in
or continue their account setup.


413
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,407 line:0
Once the user has successfully signed in,


414
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,676 line:0
your authentication handler
will be called again,


415
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,811 line:0
this time without any errors
or UI to present,


416
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,279 line:0
and you're ready to start your game.


417
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,716 line:-2
You'll also need to handle the case
where the user decides not to sign in.


418
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,418 line:-1
When this happens,


419
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:48,222 line:-2
your authentication handler will be called
yet again, but this time with an error.


420
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:51,024 line:-2
You should disable Game Center
and start your game.


421
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:54,261 line:-2
Once you've successfully authenticated
and have a signed-in local player,


422
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:56,663 line:-1
you can start accessing Game Center APIs.


423
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,132 line:-2
But I'm going to talk to you
about player profiles.


424
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,702 line:-2
This year, player profiles have moved
beyond just settings


425
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,871 line:-1
and are now a larger part of Game Center.


426
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,472 line:-1
As a result, you have the ability


427
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,542 line:-2
to present local player profiles
right from within your game,


428
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,110 line:-1
and it couldn't be easier.


429
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:13,847 line:-2
All you have to do is initialize
a GKGameCenterViewController


430
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:16,049 line:-1
with the localPlayerProfile state.


431
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:19,920 line:-2
Set yourself as the delegate, and present
it as you would any other view controller.


432
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,221 line:-1
It's that simple.


433
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,524 line:-2
From here,
players can see their achievements,


434
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,793 line:-2
find friends
and see what their friends are playing.


435
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,664 line:-2
There are cases where the local player may
have certain restrictions on their account


436
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,333 line:-2
and it's your app's responsibility
to check these restrictions


437
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,736 line:-1
and disable or hide relevant content.


438
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:36,970 line:-1
As we can see here,


439
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:39,373 line:-2
in addition to checking
whether the user is underage


440
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,375 line:-1
and has access to multiplayer games,


441
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,845 line:-2
I'm also checking the personalized
communications restriction.


442
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:48,148 line:-2
This is new in iOS 14,
and when this restriction is turned on,


443
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:51,752 line:-2
it means the user will not be able to use
voice or messaging features


444
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,487 line:-1
in Game Center multiplayer games.


445
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:56,223 line:-2
So if your app has
any custom communication features,


446
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,259 line:-2
be sure to honor this flag
and disable them when necessary.


447
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:02,095 line:-2
This restriction will always be true
if the user is underage.


448
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:05,799 line:-2
This year,
as part of user management on tvOS,


449
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:09,102 line:-2
Game Center has added support for
multiple Game Center accounts per device.


450
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,840 line:-2
This means that as users switch accounts,
the GKLocalPlayer will change,


451
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:16,376 line:-2
and your game will receive callbacks via
the authentication handler when it does.


452
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,645 line:-2
This is all done transparently
to your game,


453
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:22,916 line:-2
giving you the ability to easily support
multiple players with very few changes.


454
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:25,886 line:-2
Any tvOS game
can easily opt into this feature


455
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:29,256 line:-2
by adding the user management capability
in Xcode.


456
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:33,427 line:0
Refer to the tvOS multiuser session
for more information.


457
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,529 line:-1
Now let's talk about Game Center friends.


458
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,199 line:-2
Friends are an incredibly important part
of Game Center


459
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:42,669 line:-2
and are used in leaderboards,
multiplayer gaming and challenges.


460
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:44,638 line:-1
And through friend profiles,


461
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:47,007 line:-2
you'll be able to see
which games friends are playing


462
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:49,209 line:-2
and the achievements they've earned
in those games.


463
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,211 line:-1
With local player profiles,


464
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:54,314 line:-2
we now have one place where you can see
all your Game Center activity,


465
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,483 line:-1
including achievements and games.


466
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,886 line:-2
You can see all your friends
and invite new ones.


467
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:01,355 line:-2
You will also have access
to your friends' profiles.


468
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,156 line:-1
These are referred to as player cards.


469
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:05,859 line:-2
From here, you can quickly see
what your friends are playing


470
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:07,528 line:-1
and the achievements they've earned.


471
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,763 line:-2
This year,
you'll notice player cards are accessible


472
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,865 line:-2
from many different places
throughout Game Center.


473
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:15,202 line:-2
And with player profiles
becoming a larger part of Game Center,


474
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:18,338 line:-2
profile privacy and visibility
becomes even more important.


475
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,276 line:-2
Players can choose
from three different privacy settings--


476
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,445 line:-1
Everyone, Friends Only and No One.


477
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,881 line:-2
This is all handled automatically
in the game,


478
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:29,816 line:-1
showing and hiding profile information


479
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:32,119 line:-2
depending on which setting
a player chooses.


480
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:37,357 line:-2
You can see the difference between someone
with a profile visible to everyone...


481
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:40,861 line:-1
and a profile visible to no one.


482
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,163 line:-1
To wrap things up,


483
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,200 line:-2
we've taken a look at the different types
of Game Center players,


484
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:47,734 line:-1
the importance of authentication


485
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,137 line:-2
and making sure that it's done
as early as possible,


486
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:53,073 line:-2
the Game Center APIs
around presenting player profiles,


487
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,110 line:-2
honoring player restrictions
and enabling multiuser support on tvOS.


488
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,847 line:-1
We've talked about the new player cards


489
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:04,017 line:-2
and how different privacy settings affect
what other players can and cannot see.


490
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:08,989 line:-2
Earlier, Ally, Udayan and Christy took you
through what's new in Game Center,


491
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,691 line:-1
the new in-game dashboard,


492
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:13,026 line:-2
and how to enable Access Point
in your game.


493
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:14,995 line:-1
In our next session,


494
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:17,965 line:-2
you'll get a more in-depth look
at some of the cool new features


495
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:20,501 line:-2
in leaderboards, achievements
and multiplayer gaming.


496
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,802 line:-1
That's all for this session.


497
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,937 line:-2
Thanks for watching.
Have a great rest of your day.
