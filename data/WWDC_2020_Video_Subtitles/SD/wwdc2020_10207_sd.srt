00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:06,874 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,243 line:0
Hi. I'm Thalia,


3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:14,081 line:0
and together with Paolo, we're here
to go through what's new in SF Symbols.


4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:19,386 line:-2
Today, we're going to have a recap
of what SF Symbols is in the basics.


5
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,390 line:-2
We're going to look
at some new additions and refinements.


6
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,026 line:-1
We will talk about localized symbols


7
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,929 line:-2
and how you can make your apps
awesome with them.


8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,198 line:-2
We will see how to deal with
old and new symbols


9
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,668 line:-1
when targeting different OS versions.


10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,070 line:-1
We will talk about colors.


11
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:42,276 line:0
And lastly, we're going to talk
about layouts when using SF Symbols.


12
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,443 line:0
So, let's get started.


13
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,915 line:-2
At Apple, we design interfaces
for apps and devices


14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,717 line:-2
that millions of people use
around the world.


15
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,519 line:-1
When we design at this scale,


16
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:56,323 line:-2
it is essential to have a visual system
that embodies ideas,


17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,427 line:-2
giving more substantial meaning
to representations of actions, objects


18
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,096 line:-2
and even more abstract concepts
like language.


19
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,866 line:-1
That's why we designed SF Symbols,


20
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:10,337 line:-2
a consistent and flexible library
of iconography we introduced last year


21
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:14,875 line:-2
that is designed to seamlessly integrate
with the system font, San Francisco.


22
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,077 line:-1
All the San Francisco families:


23
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:23,050 line:-2
SF Pro, SF Pro Rounded, SF Compact
and SF Compact Rounded.


24
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,153 line:-1
When symbols appear next to text,


25
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,356 line:-2
they are vertically centered
with a cap height.


26
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,360 line:-2
Still, there are other typographic
guidelines we need to consider.


27
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,163 line:-1
Let's look at the baseline.


28
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,267 line:-2
The baseline is the imaginary line
upon which the text rests,


29
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,003 line:-2
and all typographic elements
are related to it.


30
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:48,976 line:-2
While text always sits on the baseline,
that's not necessarily true for symbols.


31
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,678 line:-2
The relationship of the symbols
with a baseline


32
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,580 line:-1
works in a bit of a different way.


33
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,718 line:-2
Indeed, symbols are designed
to work next to text,


34
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,555 line:-2
but we take the baseline
as a flexible guide when creating one.


35
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:05,526 line:-2
Some can sit above the baseline,
like the infinity symbol.


36
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,564 line:-2
And some symbols can descend below it,
like the folder symbol.


37
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,367 line:-2
This is intended,
and it's meant to optically balance


38
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,170 line:-2
the shape of the symbol
with San Francisco,


39
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,906 line:-2
so consider this
when designing your own symbols.


40
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:23,477 line:-2
All symbols come in three scales:
small, medium and large,


41
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,313 line:-1
with medium being the default scale.


42
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,816 line:-2
The symbol scales can be used
to vary the emphasis of a symbol


43
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,819 line:-1
relative to the text it sits adjacent to


44
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:36,557 line:-2
while remaining weight-matched
and vertically centered with text.


45
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,360 line:-2
Let's take a look at the scales
in more detail.


46
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:45,265 line:0
Small symbols are approximately
20% smaller than the medium scale.


47
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,736 line:0
And large symbols are about 30% larger
than the medium scale.


48
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,941 line:0
But as we can see, only scaling the symbol


49
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,410 line:0
will make them appear
to have different weights.


50
00:02:56,877 --> 00:03:00,547 line:0
Of all the symbols,
the small scale looks lighter,


51
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,749 line:0
and the large scale looks bolder.


52
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:08,088 line:0
It's a very subtle difference,
but we make some weight compensations


53
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:11,258 line:0
which allow us to maintain
the same stroke thickness,


54
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,293 line:0
making the symbols look weight-matched


55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,463 line:0
not only between the scales
but also with text.


56
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,066 line:0
Here are some examples.


57
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,134 line:0
Different scales may be appropriate


58
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,405 line:0
based on the amount of vertical space
surrounding a symbol in a container.


59
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,475 line:0
Remember, the point size
of all these symbols


60
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,144 line:0
is the same relative to the text.


61
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,780 line:0
It's just the scale of the symbol
that changes.


62
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,619 line:-2
You've seen SF Symbols
in the user interfaces since last year


63
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,455 line:-2
throughout the system
and the apps we make,


64
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,056 line:-1
but also from you.


65
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,360 line:-2
These are only some of the examples
of what you have made.


66
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,029 line:-1
The response has been truly amazing.


67
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,599 line:-2
Let's look at how to use SF Symbols
with an example.


68
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,669 line:-2
We're going to see how to do this
in design tools and in code.


69
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,605 line:-2
We're going to use
the SF Symbols app and Xcode.


70
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:02,643 line:-1
The SF Symbols app has been updated,


71
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,379 line:-2
and a better version is available
for download


72
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,749 line:-2
from the Apple Developer website
like before.


73
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,851 line:-2
It comes with a version
of the system fonts


74
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,553 line:-1
suitable for design tools.


75
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,855 line:-1
And these fonts have symbols in them.


76
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,492 line:-2
So, here's the app I'm working on
for our example.


77
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,394 line:-2
This is a great opportunity
to use symbols.


78
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,565 line:-2
With symbols, we can make
the Play and the Shuffle button


79
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,301 line:-1
more distinctive and recognizable.


80
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:31,371 line:-2
To do that, let's look at it
in a design tool like Sketch.


81
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,675 line:-2
Here's my document
with the interface I'm working on.


82
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,879 line:-2
I have installed the SF Symbols app
and the fonts that come with it.


83
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,416 line:-2
We now need to add
the Play and the Shuffle symbols.


84
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,452 line:-2
To do that,
let's go to the SF Symbols app,


85
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,921 line:-1
go into the search field and look for it.


86
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,289 line:-1
Here it is.


87
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:52,893 line:-2
Now, I just copy the symbol
with the usual shortcut, command-C,


88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,895 line:-1
or using the Edit drop-down menu.


89
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,232 line:-1
Then I'll just paste it in my artwork.


90
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,002 line:-1
That's it. That's all I need.


91
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,672 line:-2
See here that I have my text
set out to 17 points


92
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,308 line:-1
for the text and for the symbol.


93
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,844 line:-2
I can then do the same
for the shuffle symbol.


94
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:17,851 line:-2
I'll go back to the app, search for it,
then I'll just copy and paste it.


95
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,422 line:-1
Nothing changes.


96
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,292 line:-2
This is a good spot
to learn how to do this in code.


97
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,861 line:-1
To do that, here's Paolo to show us how.


98
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,031 line:-2
Here we have the same view
implemented in UIKit.


99
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:34,368 line:-2
I construct my image
with UIImage(systemName


100
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,736 line:-1
and set it to my view.


101
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,742 line:-2
The initializer takes a symbol name,
so I look for the symbol name in the app.


102
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:45,646 line:-2
I go to the app, search for "play"
and here it is.


103
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,482 line:-1
It's called "play.fill."


104
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,618 line:-1
Good. One down.


105
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,655 line:-2
For the next one,
Thalia tells me it's called "shuffle."


106
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,323 line:-1
So I go back to the app,


107
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,959 line:-2
search for "shuffle"
and, indeed, here it is.


108
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:04,198 line:-2
Pro tip: I can copy the symbol name
with shift-command-C


109
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,900 line:-1
and paste that directly into Xcode.


110
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:07,968 line:-1
Careful here.


111
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,238 line:-2
I copied a symbol name,
not the symbol itself.


112
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:13,707 line:-1
If you copy the symbol, it will not work.


113
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,277 line:-1
Now, we're ready to build and run.


114
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,780 line:-1
And our symbols are showing up.


115
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:23,750 line:-2
That's cool,
but in this instance, we can do better.


116
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:27,354 line:-2
If we look at the relationship
between the text and the symbol,


117
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:28,989 line:-1
the symbol appears too big.


118
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,993 line:-2
We can actually select a different scale
for the symbol.


119
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,563 line:-2
And remember,
we are not changing the point size.


120
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,834 line:-2
In Sketch, we can do this by selecting
the small scale stylistic set


121
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,369 line:-1
from the Text menu.


122
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,472 line:-2
Now, let's do the same
for the shuffle symbol.


123
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,375 line:-1
Again, let's select the small scale.


124
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,446 line:-2
Also notice here how,
when I change the scale,


125
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:57,084 line:-2
the symbol remains optically centered
and weight-matched with the text.


126
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,986 line:-1
And to change the symbol scaling code,


127
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:02,122 line:-2
we are going to use
the symbol configuration for that.


128
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,359 line:-2
So, I just construct
my UIImage.SymbolConfiguration


129
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,528 line:-1
with a scale, and I'm done.


130
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,764 line:-2
I could be done here,
but there's a better way.


131
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,933 line:-2
Let's take it up a notch
and configure a symbol


132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,868 line:-1
with the same text style as the font,


133
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,304 line:-2
so the symbol can resize well
with Dynamic Type.


134
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:22,576 line:-2
We can do that by passing the textStyle
argument to our SymbolConfiguration,


135
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,478 line:-1
in this case, we have a headline.


136
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,747 line:-1
If we build and run now,


137
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:30,384 line:-2
we can see that symbols
follow the selected text size.


138
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,721 line:-2
If I have it set to large size,
text and symbols go big.


139
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:39,393 line:-2
If I pick a small size,
text and symbols resize accordingly.


140
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:44,031 line:-2
This is the kind of behavior
we can only get if we use textStyles.


141
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:48,402 line:-2
If you've been using SwiftUI instead,
then using symbols looks like this.


142
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:53,140 line:-2
Call Image with systemName
to get an image of the symbol back.


143
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,443 line:-2
Change its scale
with the imageScale modifier


144
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,645 line:-2
and change other parameters
of the configuration


145
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,581 line:-1
like point size, font weight


146
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,184 line:-2
or, as we've seen,
textStyle via the font modifier.


147
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,688 line:-2
New this year,
we have the very convenient label,


148
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:11,391 line:-2
which lets us construct
a very common UI element all in one go.


149
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,229 line:-2
And we also have a handy way
to do text attachments


150
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,564 line:-1
by combining text and image.


151
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,133 line:0
For more information,
make sure to check out


152
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,736 line:0
the "What's New in SwiftUI" session.


153
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:26,974 line:-2
This is all great,
but this app also works on macOS,


154
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,276 line:-1
and it is not a Catalyst app.


155
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,945 line:-1
Here's what it looks like in Big Sur.


156
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,817 line:-2
We're thrilled to announce
that starting from macOS Big Sur,


157
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:40,120 line:-2
SF Symbols are also available
on the Mac natively.


158
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:46,126 line:-2
Now, for the first time, old platforms
can benefit from this unified iconography.


159
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,996 line:-1
In design, nothing changes.


160
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:52,032 line:-2
The way I use symbols
is identical to the other platforms.


161
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,869 line:-2
In code, we can use symbols
with the new NSImage API,


162
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,272 line:-2
which can take
an accessibility description


163
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,740 line:-1
in the constructor.


164
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,810 line:-2
So, here we have it,
our Music app in its full glory


165
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,146 line:-1
using SF Symbols on macOS.


166
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,082 line:-1
As part of the UI redesign for macOS,


167
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,885 line:-2
not only did we bring SF Symbols
to the Mac,


168
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:14,621 line:-2
we also have
some additions and refinements.


169
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:19,059 line:-2
In iOS 13,
we shipped more than 1,500 symbols.


170
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:23,297 line:-1
Now we have more than 750 new ones.


171
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,466 line:-1
We have some devices,


172
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,168 line:-1
some for transportation,


173
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,672 line:-1
some symbols related to game controllers


174
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,007 line:-1
and even some human-related symbols.


175
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:38,545 line:-2
And all these are neatly organized
in the app with categories.


176
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,716 line:-2
And not only does the app come
with some predefined categories,


177
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,152 line:-2
but you can also create
your own collections now.


178
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:49,556 line:-2
For example, if I'm designing an app
related to sounds and music,


179
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:54,094 line:-2
and I want to have all the symbols I want
to use in one easy, accessible place,


180
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,864 line:-2
I can create a collection
based on my selection,


181
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,665 line:-1
name it "Music," in this case,


182
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,368 line:-2
and even add or delete
more symbols as I go.


183
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:06,340 line:-2
Another improvement is
for when symbols are laid out vertically.


184
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,810 line:-2
This is especially true for symbols
that have variants with badges.


185
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:14,715 line:-2
For instance, if we focus on folder
and folder-related symbols,


186
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,619 line:-2
you can see how more often than not
we want to align the symbols


187
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,555 line:-2
so that the badge
extends beyond the folder itself.


188
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,758 line:-1
This is an optical alignment,


189
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:28,629 line:-2
so you should use your best judgment
if you're creating your own symbol.


190
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,566 line:-2
This is a great opportunity
to have another look at the template.


191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,868 line:-1
If you're not familiar with the template,


192
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:38,238 line:-2
it is that artifact
that is a design source file


193
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,674 line:-1
that I can export from the SF Symbols app,


194
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:44,678 line:-2
modify and directly import
into Xcode as is.


195
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:51,185 line:-2
There are three rows, one for each
symbol scale, small, medium and large,


196
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:54,922 line:-2
and nine columns, one for each weight,
from ultralight to black.


197
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,425 line:-2
Each one of the symbols
is in its own layer


198
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,994 line:-1
with a unique, descriptive identifier.


199
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:05,098 line:-2
These layer names are vital
to the integrity of the file,


200
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,002 line:-2
so make sure that if you customize
the template, you maintain this structure.


201
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:13,740 line:-2
We have a new version of the template now.
It is labeled as version 2.


202
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:19,246 line:-2
It's pretty much identical to version 1,
especially in terms of structure,


203
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:22,182 line:0
but if we zoom in,
there's one important difference.


204
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,019 line:0
The margins are not rectangles anymore,
but lines.


205
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,823 line:0
This is what lets us set positive
or negative margins.


206
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,193 line:0
In this case,
the margin on the left is positive,


207
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,928 line:0
and the one on the right is negative


208
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:38,365 line:0
because it tucks in, overlapping
with the outlines of the symbol.


209
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,669 line:0
The color is not important here,
it's just a visual indicator.


210
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,905 line:0
It's their name and position that matters.


211
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,543 line:-2
In code, nothing changes.
I still call my symbol as before.


212
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,945 line:-1
But when I go use the symbol,


213
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:55,782 line:-2
the margins produce the correct alignment
that Thalia was just describing.


214
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,453 line:-1
So, let's talk about localization.


215
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,890 line:-2
As we know,
English uses the Latin alphabet,


216
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,259 line:-1
which is a left-to-right writing system,


217
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:11,198 line:-2
but in other locales, the writing system
is right to left, like Arabic or Hebrew.


218
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,835 line:-2
We've had localized symbols
since last year.


219
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,670 line:-1
Now we have more.


220
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,872 line:-2
Remember that these
localize automatically,


221
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:22,176 line:-2
so there's no need to call out
the localized variants in your spec.


222
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:27,080 line:-2
If a symbol is localized, the app
will show you what these variants are.


223
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,451 line:-2
To implement this for your custom symbols,
there's nothing new.


224
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:37,191 line:-2
Remember to localize your asset catalog
and assign a locale to each SVG template.


225
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,227 line:-2
In some cases,
we do need a different design


226
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:44,164 line:-2
that properly responds
to the design sensibilities of the locale,


227
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,633 line:-2
but in some other cases,
in right-to-left locales,


228
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,802 line:-1
we can just flip the symbol as is.


229
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,073 line:-2
To achieve this, set the direction
of the symbol to "mirrors."


230
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,276 line:-1
This is also a good spot for a quick word


231
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:59,079 line:-2
on how to handle deprecated names
and new symbols


232
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:02,249 line:-2
when it comes to targeting
previous versions of the OS.


233
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:06,854 line:-2
SF Symbols naming system
is designed to have internal consistency.


234
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,691 line:-2
And the repertoire keeps growing
as we introduce new symbols this year.


235
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,460 line:-1
Let's look at this example.


236
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,495 line:-1
In the case of the bin symbols,


237
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:19,032 line:-2
we have bins with X marks
and arrows pointing up,


238
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:22,035 line:-2
we have filled variants
and circled variants too.


239
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,740 line:-2
We strive to keep consistency
in the naming scheme.


240
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:31,945 line:-2
That's why what was called
"bin.xmark" is now "xmark.bin."


241
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:37,084 line:-2
The shape that we named "bin" moved
to preserve coherence with the system.


242
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:41,622 line:-2
So how should you deal with that
when targeting different OSes?


243
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,458 line:-2
First of all,
this information is available to you


244
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:46,994 line:-2
when browsing symbols
in the SF Symbols app.


245
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,831 line:-2
So if your app minimum deployment target
is iOS 13,


246
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:54,568 line:-2
you should be looking for symbols
available in that version of the OS.


247
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:59,239 line:-2
Those symbols may have a different name
from the latest version of the OS,


248
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,877 line:-2
so if you're backwards deploying
to iOS 13, you have to use the old name.


249
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,146 line:-1
The new name will not be available there.


250
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:09,783 line:-2
But if your minimum deployment target
is iOS 14, instead,


251
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,585 line:-1
then you should use the new name.


252
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,087 line:-1
Xcode is aware of these name changes


253
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,357 line:-2
and will warn you accordingly
if you're using storyboards.


254
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,760 line:-1
If you're not careful about this,


255
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:24,464 line:-2
people using your app will likely see
no symbol, or worse, even get a crash,


256
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,700 line:-2
which is definitely not
a great experience.


257
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,237 line:-1
Okay, next, let's talk about colors.


258
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,872 line:-1
Symbols can be colored.


259
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:36,310 line:-2
As of last year, by default,
they take the tint color of the app.


260
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,446 line:-2
As a reference,
here's how Calendar does it.


261
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,549 line:-1
But there are some cases


262
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:46,220 line:-2
where we want one symbol
to come with more than one color,


263
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,754 line:-1
like in the Weather widget.


264
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,091 line:-1
The symbols related to the weather


265
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:54,862 line:-2
are way more effective
if they come in multiple colors.


266
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,898 line:-1
And sometimes we want both.


267
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:01,335 line:-2
We want part of the symbol
to reflect the tint color,


268
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,770 line:-1
but also come with some pre-tinted parts.


269
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:09,576 line:-2
We're happy to announce that all of this
is possible now with multicolor symbols.


270
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,480 line:-2
A set of predefined colored symbols
to use in your UIs.


271
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,184 line:-2
You can access them
by the color mode preview in the app,


272
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,420 line:-2
through the "Toolbar" button
or with the multicolor category.


273
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,625 line:-2
You can also choose between
the two preview modes:


274
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,761 line:-2
"monochrome" for the black and white
version of the symbol


275
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:30,163 line:-1
and "multicolor" for the colored version.


276
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:36,036 line:-2
In my specs, I will just make sure
to annotate symbols with "multicolor."


277
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,141 line:-2
These colors adapt dynamically
with appearances, just like system colors.


278
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,912 line:-2
In code, this is done by asking
for a version of the symbol image


279
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,747 line:-1
with a different rendering mode.


280
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,585 line:-2
Pass true to setTemplate
for the monochrome, tintable symbol,


281
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:54,021 line:-2
and this is the default behavior,
by the way,


282
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,890 line:-2
and pass false
to get the multicolor version.


283
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,193 line:-1
Speaking of specs,


284
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,463 line:-2
let's have a refresher of the benefits
of using symbols in layouts.


285
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,634 line:-2
Here's an example of a spec.
In this case, it is for Mail.


286
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,838 line:-2
We have a pretty standard
macOS sidebar layout,


287
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,407 line:-1
with symbols and text next to each other.


288
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:18,045 line:0
The symbols here specify
a scale and a point size,


289
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:20,647 line:0
the same point size as the text.


290
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:23,250 line:0
Symbols and text are baseline aligned.


291
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,586 line:0
There should be no surprises here by now.


292
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,290 line:-2
On the vertical axis,
the labels are leading aligned,


293
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:33,427 line:-2
and my column of symbols
is center aligned.


294
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:36,129 line:-2
This may be different
from what you're used to


295
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,432 line:-1
if you're coming from a pre-symbols world.


296
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:41,602 line:-1
Notice here, I do not specify frames.


297
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:46,406 line:-2
Symbols are not designed to be constrained
in frames with a specific size.


298
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:50,844 line:-2
It's the typographic nature of symbols
that really makes it easy to spec


299
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:52,246 line:-1
as if they were text.


300
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:56,750 line:-2
This frees you from having to
specify frames and alignments


301
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:59,853 line:-2
that would make it really hard,
if not impossible,


302
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,723 line:-2
to leverage all the features
of SF Symbols.


303
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,192 line:-1
Symbols have their own size.


304
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:08,328 line:-2
They will occupy a different amount
of surface on the screen,


305
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,931 line:-2
but they're coherent
relative to each other,


306
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:13,032 line:-1
so don't force them into a frame.


307
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:17,337 line:-2
Be wary of anything that uses
sizeThatFits and symbols.


308
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,540 line:-2
As long as symbols have the same
text style or point size,


309
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:21,608 line:-1
you will be good.


310
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:27,647 line:-2
Also make sure to use center alignments
rather than aspectFit or scale to fit,


311
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:32,853 line:-2
and check your content gravity is set
to "centered" if you're using CALayers,


312
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:36,857 line:-2
especially when symbols are enclosed
in a well-defined area.


313
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,059 line:-1
When laying symbols next to text,


314
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:42,963 line:-2
remember to align them to the baseline,
not to align them to their center.


315
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,100 line:-2
And vertically, use alignment guides
to make the symbols and text


316
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,137 line:-1
grow harmoniously when text gets resized.


317
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,207 line:-1
Okay, so let's recap what we've covered.


318
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:57,077 line:-2
We have a new version of the app
and new features.


319
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,046 line:-1
We have hundreds of new symbols.


320
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,583 line:-2
Some of the existing symbols
got new names,


321
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,451 line:-1
and we saw how to deal with them.


322
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:09,289 line:-2
Remember to use the oldest name
for the minimum OS you're targeting.


323
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:15,996 line:-2
We also saw how to use SF Symbols on macOS
with the new NSImage API in AppKit.


324
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:19,933 line:-1
We saw how to deal with localized symbols.


325
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,103 line:-1
And we have new multicolor symbols now


326
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:27,074 line:-2
and how to use them
with the different rendering modes.


327
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:33,046 line:-2
And lastly, we had a refresher
on how to spec for symbol images


328
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:37,551 line:-2
by not specifying frames
but symbol configurations and alignments.


329
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:42,523 line:-2
I hope you enjoyed learning about
all the new features of SF Symbols,


330
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,225 line:-2
and we are looking forward
to seeing what you will do.
