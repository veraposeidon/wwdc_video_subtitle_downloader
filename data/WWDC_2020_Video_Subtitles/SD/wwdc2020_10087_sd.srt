1
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,473 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,111 line:0
Hey. My name is Sofiane,


3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:14,047 line:0
and I work on Proactive Intelligence
here at Apple.


4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,116 line:0
Today, I want to talk to you about


5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,485 line:0
how your app
can make friends with the system.


6
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,421 line:-1
As Radhika showed in the previous video,


7
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:25,092 line:-2
system intelligence can help people
at every step of their journey


8
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,462 line:-2
in using their apps and the devices
that those apps are installed on.


9
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:33,767 line:-2
The better job you, as a developer,
do to integrate with the system,


10
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:38,205 line:-2
and the more people use your apps,
the more we can help them over time.


11
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,707 line:-2
But how do you do a good job
of integrating with the system?


12
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,645 line:-2
I'll explain by talking about
a few key concepts


13
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,147 line:-2
shared across
all of our intelligence technologies.


14
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,150 line:-2
Then I'll have my colleagues,
Mert and Chad,


15
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,453 line:-2
talk about how their teams
use these foundational concepts


16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,523 line:-2
in slightly different ways,
all to achieve the same goal:


17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,625 line:-1
making everyday things easier.


18
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:03,297 line:-2
And then Mark will come back
to recap exactly what we hope you do next.


19
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:07,034 line:-2
So, let's talk about
what makes the intelligent system work.


20
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,838 line:-2
We all live busy lives,
and for many of us,


21
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,307 line:-2
our iOS devices have become
an important part


22
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,675 line:-1
of how we get things done.


23
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,045 line:-2
People rely on apps
dozens of times every day,


24
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,381 line:-2
for tasks ranging from communication,
ordering food,


25
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,350 line:-1
or even tracking water intake.


26
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,087 line:-2
And again, our goal is to make
these everyday interactions


27
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:30,090 line:-1
as smooth and frictionless as possible


28
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,292 line:-2
so you can get time back
to focus on your life.


29
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,628 line:-1
And for this to happen,


30
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,564 line:-2
the system and your app
need to work together.


31
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,066 line:-1
And by working together,


32
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,236 line:-2
what I really mean is that
we need to speak the same language.


33
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:46,039 line:-2
For that common language,
we built the Intents framework.


34
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,509 line:-2
There are three key concepts
you should know about,


35
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:51,578 line:-1
and these are define, learn and execute.


36
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,382 line:-2
Understanding them will help you
accelerate your users


37
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,019 line:-2
along your apps' critical paths,
and adapt to their preferences over time.


38
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,623 line:0
Let's first talk about
what we mean by "Define."


39
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,859 line:0
Ultimately, you,
as developers and designers,


40
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,594 line:0
just need to ask yourself,


41
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:11,064 line:0
what are the important actions
that people want to perform with your app?


42
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,701 line:-2
The goal is simply to determine
what are the key and repeatable things


43
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,537 line:-1
that people want to accomplish.


44
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,007 line:-2
You can define these actions
using what we call "intents."


45
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:24,411 line:-2
Intents represent the "what."
What do people do in your app?


46
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,813 line:-1
Ask yourself, "What are those tasks?


47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,682 line:-2
And what are
all of the relevant attributes


48
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,250 line:-1
necessary to carry them out?"


49
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,488 line:-2
What, for example,
does it mean to track your water intake?


50
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,293 line:-2
Or what's involved in checking the news?
Or what does it mean to order coffee?


51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,995 line:-2
Let's actually take a closer look
at that example.


52
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:47,334 line:-2
So, to order coffee, you know you'll need
an intent that represents that action.


53
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,137 line:-2
And, of course,
people like their coffee made differently.


54
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,072 line:-2
There are obviously
different types of coffee.


55
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,874 line:-1
Maybe the size of the drink matters too.


56
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,244 line:-2
Details like this
are the attributes of the action,


57
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,479 line:-2
also known as the parameters
of the intent.


58
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,783 line:-2
The Intents framework
gives you the flexibility


59
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,385 line:-1
to define your intent and its parameters,


60
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,455 line:-2
making it easy for you
to package all of the information


61
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,191 line:-2
about the action someone is performing
inside your app.


62
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,695 line:-2
Here we're creating
an "order coffee" intent


63
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,630 line:-1
and defining two of its parameters,


64
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,999 line:-2
representing the type of coffee item
and its size.


65
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,803 line:-2
With those parameters defined,
we can set these values


66
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,372 line:-2
to represent
what the user is actually ordering,


67
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,574 line:-1
and here, it's a large iced latte.


68
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:31,678 line:-2
So, to summarize, the intents you define
are a key building block


69
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:35,716 line:-2
that enable your app and the system
to speak the same language.


70
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,419 line:-2
Now, a key piece
of that intelligent system experience


71
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,688 line:-1
is learning how people do things


72
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,525 line:-2
in order to predict
how they might do so again in the future.


73
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,959 line:-1
But how do we learn?


74
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,328 line:-1
All it takes is someone using your app,


75
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,899 line:-2
and as long as you, as a developer,
do something called a "donation"


76
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,502 line:-2
as people use your app and perform
the tasks that are important to them,


77
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,039 line:-2
these donations provide signals
that the system can use to learn from.


78
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,942 line:-1
This happens using on-device intelligence,


79
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,512 line:-2
and eventually, we'll detect patterns
that help us make predictions,


80
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,081 line:-2
like the Siri Suggestions
we surface on the lock screen.


81
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,518 line:-2
And when someone uses
a lock screen suggestion,


82
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,788 line:-2
not only do they save time,
but we can tell that we did a good job,


83
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:18,559 line:-2
and that positive signal helps us make
even better predictions in the future.


84
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:22,129 line:-2
So, let's dive deeper
into this concept of donations.


85
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,333 line:-2
Donations help us answer questions
like when do I order coffee?


86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,101 line:-1
Or where does that typically happen?


87
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:31,672 line:-2
But time and location
are only a few of the signals that we use


88
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,875 line:-2
to understand something more important,
which is context.


89
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,445 line:-2
As JP said earlier, we want you
to feel like you have superpowers.


90
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,348 line:-2
We pull that off when we match
the task you want to accomplish


91
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,050 line:-1
with just the right moment.


92
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,954 line:-2
Now, a donation is simply a record,
a snapshot in time,


93
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,156 line:-2
of an intent
that's actually been executed.


94
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,826 line:-2
Maybe today,
your app donates your large latte order


95
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,395 line:-2
because that's just what you crave
as you start the day.


96
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,165 line:-2
And a bit later in the day,
you order something more refreshing,


97
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,366 line:-1
like a lemonade.


98
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:01,568 line:-1
But the next day,


99
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,505 line:-2
you start your morning off again
with another large latte.


100
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:10,244 line:-2
And as people continue to use your app,
these signals accumulate over time.


101
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,212 line:-1
And while there might be changeups,


102
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,781 line:-2
patterns emerge
and the system can learn them.


103
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,118 line:-2
Once we learn these patterns,
we make predictions.


104
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,121 line:-2
We try to match the right task
to your context,


105
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,123 line:-1
and we get better the more we learn.


106
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,927 line:-2
And again here,
privacy is at the very core of what we do.


107
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,763 line:-2
The information you donate
never leaves the device.


108
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,899 line:-1
The system uses your donations locally


109
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,469 line:-2
to offer an amazing,
personalized intelligent experience.


110
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,005 line:-2
What happens on your device
stays on your device.


111
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,607 line:-1
So, we keep returning to this point


112
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,744 line:-2
that an intelligent system
should save you time,


113
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,213 line:-2
but it can only do that
if we drastically reduce


114
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,149 line:-2
the amount of friction
required to get something done.


115
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,251 line:-1
A key way we do that


116
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,188 line:-2
is by accelerating people
to the things they want to accomplish.


117
00:05:55,489 --> 00:06:00,027 line:0
So, as a developer, it's important for you
to be prepared to perform an action


118
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,595 line:0
even when your app is not running.


119
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,532 line:-2
When we make a prediction,
we may reconstruct an intent


120
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,135 line:-2
from the information
gleaned from your app donations.


121
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,072 line:-2
When our prediction is right
and someone engages with it,


122
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,541 line:-2
we pass the underlying intent
back over to you


123
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,143 line:-1
so you can execute it in your app.


124
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,079 line:-1
Now, your goal is to execute that action,


125
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,014 line:-2
and there are two ways
you might go about this.


126
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,319 line:-2
Whenever possible, you should
execute the action in the background.


127
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,254 line:-1
If you support background execution,


128
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,356 line:-2
the action is performed
right then and there


129
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:31,425 line:-2
and the user doesn't have to switch
between apps.


130
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,929 line:-2
You even have the ability to display
your beautiful app UI right in this flow.


131
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,931 line:-1
Here, we're showing a dialogue


132
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,767 line:-2
to let the user confirm their order
before placing it.


133
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,805 line:-1
Alternatively, we can launch your app.


134
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,607 line:-1
Here, you should execute the action


135
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,676 line:-2
and take the user
right to the relevant part of your app.


136
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,579 line:-2
In that case,
it's our order confirmation screen.


137
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,916 line:-2
These were some of the important concepts
you should know about


138
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:59,219 line:-2
so your app can take full advantage
of our intelligent system experience.


139
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,989 line:-1
Now to share more about how teams at Apple


140
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,758 line:-2
use intents and donations
in greater detail,


141
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,493 line:-2
I'm going to hand it off
to my colleague Mert


142
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,729 line:-1
to talk about Shortcuts. Mert?


143
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,531 line:-1
Thanks, Sofiane.


144
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,134 line:-2
To illustrate how we use
intents and donations,


145
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:18,172 line:-2
I'm going to use an example some of you
might be familiar with called Soup Chef.


146
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,741 line:-2
We've used this as an example app
for Shortcuts since we launched,


147
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,544 line:-2
and it's a great way for me
to use the real plural of "soup,"


148
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,279 line:-1
which is, in fact, "soups."


149
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,281 line:-1
This app is pretty basic.


150
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,783 line:-2
You can launch it,
take a look at today's soups


151
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,451 line:-1
and place an order for one of them.


152
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,124 line:-2
But let's step back for a second.
What can you do using the Soup Chef app?


153
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,561 line:-1
You can order one of the available soups,


154
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,030 line:-2
check the remaining delivery time
for a soup order,


155
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,098 line:-1
or get your order history.


156
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,901 line:-2
But how does the app actually get
these features in front of people?


157
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,240 line:-2
All of these things, this functionality,
is contained in the app itself.


158
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,944 line:-2
So, to build on
what Sofiane was talking about,


159
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,214 line:-2
that means I have to stop
whatever it is I'm doing at that moment


160
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,550 line:-1
to unlock my device, find the app icon,


161
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,420 line:-2
and maneuver through
some layers of that app's UI,


162
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,188 line:-1
all just to get soup.


163
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,391 line:-2
I mean, let's say I'm driving
and I really, really want soup.


164
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,126 line:-1
This has been known to happen.


165
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,729 line:-2
I should not reach out to my phone,
launch an app,


166
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,098 line:-1
and dig around some nested table views.


167
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,301 line:-2
And, yes, I won't drink my soup
until I'm stationary at some later time.


168
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,104 line:-1
For that, we have Siri.


169
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,474 line:0
We have CarPlay for the car,
HomePod in the home,


170
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,643 line:0
or even AirPods when you're on the go.


171
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,479 line:0
There's always some device
that can respond to "Hey Siri."


172
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,448 line:-2
So, stepping back
into the role of the app user,


173
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,753 line:-2
this is why we often talk about how
Shortcuts can accelerate everyday tasks.


174
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:45,259 line:-2
Using my voice to ask Siri to order soup
is mostly convenient


175
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,961 line:-2
because it makes this thing
I already do easier.


176
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:52,232 line:-2
And for someone who's looking for ways
to make their everyday routines easier,


177
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,433 line:-1
setting up a shortcut


178
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,637 line:-2
and getting into the habit
of using your voice is very much worth it.


179
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,407 line:-2
So, whatever that thing is for your app,
that killer feature,


180
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:03,243 line:-2
which may even differ
between different people,


181
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,312 line:-2
that's the thing
you should expose as a shortcut.


182
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,916 line:-2
And it doesn't need to be limited
to a single shortcut either.


183
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,485 line:-2
After placing an order
for a delicious soup,


184
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,487 line:-1
I might want to use Siri


185
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,857 line:-2
to check the delivery time
until my delicious soup arrives.


186
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,792 line:-1
So, how can you make this a reality?


187
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,328 line:-1
As Sofiane described: intents.


188
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,065 line:-2
For general categories of actions
like sending a message,


189
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:28,602 line:-2
we have system-defined intents
that you can adopt.


190
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:32,706 line:-2
For describing any other action
unique to your app, like ordering soup,


191
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,542 line:-2
you can define
entirely custom intents in Xcode.


192
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:40,714 line:-2
When you say, "Hey, Siri, order soup,"
Siri runs your "order soup" intent.


193
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:47,688 line:-2
And when you say,
"Hey, Siri, check delivery,"


194
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,756 line:-2
Siri runs your
"check delivery time" intent.


195
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,293 line:-1
For more on understanding intents,


196
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,563 line:-2
make sure to check out
the Human Interface guidelines.


197
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,333 line:-2
It's a great resource for engineers
and designers alike.


198
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,337 line:-2
For your users, adding custom intents
to Siri in the form of a shortcut


199
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,739 line:-2
is as easy as tapping on
an "Add to Siri" button.


200
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,710 line:-2
And the parameters that Sofiane
was talking about earlier,


201
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,913 line:-2
which describe the important aspects
of the thing that's being done


202
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,283 line:-2
even appear right here
in the Add to Siri flow.


203
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,521 line:-2
That's because you can actually change
how this shortcut works


204
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,755 line:-1
right when you're setting it up.


205
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,525 line:-2
Let's say I don't actually want
tomato soup every time.


206
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,361 line:-1
I could change it to clam chowder.


207
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,400 line:-1
Or, if I'm feeling really wild...


208
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,937 line:-1
I can leave it empty.


209
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,342 line:-2
And Siri will ask me what soup I want
every time I order with my voice.


210
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,811 line:-2
So, once my shortcut
has been added to Siri,


211
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,748 line:-2
now this flow can happen
without the app needing to be open.


212
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,916 line:-1
Just ask Siri.


213
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,151 line:-1
Soup time.


214
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:56,089 line:-2
[Siri] <i>I found two restaurants near you.</i>
<i>Which one do you want to order from?</i>


215
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,391 line:-1
Because voice is a powerful way


216
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,727 line:-2
to make specific features
of your app quickly accessible,


217
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,497 line:-2
it's important to provide this
Add to Siri setup flow


218
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,532 line:-1
in the flows that people already use.


219
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,135 line:-1
A lot of you developers


220
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:11,905 line:-2
already do a great job of providing
Add to Siri flows in your Settings views,


221
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,942 line:-2
but we all know the best real estate
to getting someone's attention


222
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,411 line:-2
is while they're focused on your app
to do something.


223
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,180 line:-2
Setting up a shortcut should never
interrupt that flow, of course.


224
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:24,318 line:-2
We're not asking you to sign up
for an email newsletter in a pop-up,


225
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,954 line:-2
but providing it somewhere
like an order confirmation view


226
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,022 line:-2
can help people get the most
out of your app.


227
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,491 line:-2
There is also, of course,
the Shortcuts app,


228
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:35,562 line:-2
which is built right into iOS, iPadOS,
and now watchOS.


229
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,265 line:-1
This is another popular place


230
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,534 line:-2
for people to set up shortcuts
for your intents,


231
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,837 line:-2
as well as stringing them together
with other intents from other apps


232
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,607 line:-2
to do some pretty powerful things,
even automatically.


233
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,610 line:-1
In the Shortcuts app,


234
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,579 line:-2
intents can actually take in information
from other apps,


235
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:55,048 line:-2
and likewise provide information
back to other apps.


236
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,117 line:-1
And the people that use your app


237
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,553 line:-1
can set these kinds of multistep shortcuts


238
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,655 line:-2
by just dragging and dropping
in the Shortcuts app.


239
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:06,260 line:-2
And with that, you can do multiple things
across multiple apps with a single tap.


240
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,363 line:-1
This may be a somewhat ridiculous example,


241
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,365 line:-2
but it's going to illustrate
my point well,


242
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:12,533 line:-1
so let's go for it.


243
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,803 line:-2
Here, I have my "order history" intent
from Soup Chef in a shortcut.


244
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:21,074 line:-2
This intent returns a list
of the orders I've placed per week


245
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,342 line:-1
in the past seven weeks.


246
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:26,413 line:-1
Below it, I have a great example


247
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,282 line:-2
of a full-featured intent
from the App Store,


248
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,785 line:-2
the "new chart series" intent
from the graphing app Charty.


249
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:36,023 line:-2
This action consumes the output
of the Soup Chef action,


250
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,758 line:-1
the weekly number of soups I ordered,


251
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:40,160 line:-2
and passes them onto Charty
to make a graph.


252
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,262 line:-1
Now, when I tap "Run,"


253
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,298 line:-2
I'll get a chart
of my soup-drinking habits.


254
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,603 line:-1
Look at that beautiful graph.


255
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,138 line:-1
Wow. That's a lot of soups.


256
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,975 line:-2
Again, this example
may not apply to you exactly,


257
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:58,779 line:-2
but intents and the shortcuts they power
are incredibly flexible.


258
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,482 line:-2
Instead of creating a data visualization
of your soup drinking,


259
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,717 line:-1
and, yes, you drink soup,


260
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,119 line:-2
you can ask Ari about that,
he manages the Shortcuts team,


261
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,957 line:-2
you could just as easily hook up an app
that logs your water intake


262
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,260 line:-2
and visualize it using Charty,
or almost anything else you can imagine.


263
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,263 line:-1
Also, as Sofiane discussed,


264
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,067 line:-2
we, the system, can learn and predict
future behavior, too, using donations.


265
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,237 line:-2
Soup Chef donates its intents
as you use the app.


266
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,807 line:-2
After a while,
if iOS notices that you order soup


267
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,509 line:-1
when leaving work on Thursdays,


268
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,777 line:-2
we can show its prediction
directly in Search.


269
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,651 line:-2
Or even as an automation suggestion
in Shortcuts


270
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,454 line:-2
to automatically order soup
when going home.


271
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,689 line:-1
That's intents in Siri and Shortcuts.


272
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,859 line:-2
Now we hand it off to Chad
to talk about how system intelligence


273
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,595 line:-2
works with the brand-new widgets
in iOS 14. Chad?


274
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:49,930 line:-1
Thanks, Mert.


275
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:53,534 line:-2
Hi, I'm Chad, and I work
on the Proactive Intelligence team.


276
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:57,037 line:-2
Today, I'll be talking about
the new widgets in iOS 14,


277
00:13:57,104 --> 00:14:00,707 line:-2
and how the intelligence of the system
enhances the user experience.


278
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,845 line:-2
This might sound obvious,
but part of what makes apps so great


279
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:07,181 line:-2
is that they provide people
with timely information.


280
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,884 line:-2
For instance, when I want to check
the weather for my family in New York,


281
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,021 line:-1
it's as simple as tapping on an app icon,


282
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,690 line:-2
although I might need to scroll
through a list to find the city.


283
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,061 line:-1
Or I can open Music to find some tunes.


284
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,766 line:-2
Let's see. I'll... How about some jazz?
Yeah, that sounds good.


285
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,404 line:-2
Or if I wanna look at my list
of very important tasks,


286
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,307 line:-2
I can open the Reminders app
and drill into the list.


287
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:36,076 line:-1
Just as in these examples,


288
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,612 line:-2
there are some pieces of information
that are so important,


289
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,848 line:-1
you revisit them time and time again.


290
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:45,085 line:-2
And that's the problem we wanted to solve
with the new and improved widgets.


291
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,355 line:-2
Widgets make it super easy
to see the information


292
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:51,825 line:-2
that's deep in an app's UI
right on your Home Screen.


293
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:55,696 line:-2
It's glanceable, and the best widgets
are also timely and relevant.


294
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:00,133 line:-1
As you would expect, tapping on the widget


295
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,503 line:-2
brings you right to that exact spot
in the app.


296
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,907 line:-1
Widgets are now backed by intents.


297
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:09,576 line:-2
Intents allow people to configure
the exact kind of data


298
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,345 line:-1
they want shown in their widget.


299
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,780 line:-1
It allows for more personalization.


300
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,682 line:-1
The intent is the kind of widget.


301
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,653 line:-2
In the case of weather,
the "show weather" intent


302
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,855 line:-1
allows you to pick a specific location


303
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:25,526 line:-2
because the location is defined
as a parameter in the intent.


304
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:29,730 line:-2
Now let's talk about
another new feature: Stacks.


305
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:32,099 line:-1
As you can see,


306
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:35,636 line:-2
it's very easy to drag and drop
multiple widgets on top of each other


307
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:36,870 line:-1
to create a stack.


308
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:41,575 line:-2
But we wanted to make sure
the topmost widget was timely and relevant


309
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:44,077 line:-2
using a combination
of intents and donations.


310
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,548 line:-2
And what's really cool
is that we use donations


311
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,083 line:-2
to actually rotate the widget
that's on top of the stack.


312
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,188 line:-2
So, let's say I check the weather
in New York the same time every day,


313
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,089 line:-1
the system will learn that and...


314
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:58,759 line:-1
automagically it flips for me.


315
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,528 line:-1
As Sofiane mentioned,


316
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:04,264 line:-2
donations help us learn
how people use your apps.


317
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,367 line:-2
And as Mert mentioned,
that can drive things


318
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:10,304 line:-2
like Shortcut Suggestions
on the lock screen or in Search.


319
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,974 line:-2
Similarly,
the way people use your main app


320
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,343 line:-2
is what drives
this automagical experience.


321
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:21,181 line:-2
So, not only are we making it easier
to see relevant information,


322
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:23,083 line:-1
if it's something you look for every day,


323
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,620 line:-2
we eliminate swiping around your phone
to make it even more glanceable.


324
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,656 line:-1
It's classic "surprise and delight."


325
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:32,726 line:-2
If we do our job right,
the user may not even know


326
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:34,728 line:-2
that we're doing
all this intelligent calculation


327
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,196 line:-1
under the hood.


328
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:39,299 line:-2
They'll just see that the information
they want is right there


329
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,534 line:-1
and move on with their day.


330
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,438 line:-2
The less effort required,
the more successful we've been.


331
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,007 line:-1
That's all for the new widgets and Stacks.


332
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:50,310 line:-2
Now back to Sofiane to talk
about Siri Event Suggestions.


333
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:51,645 line:-1
Thank you, Chad.


334
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:55,415 line:-2
There are many other technology areas
that build on the same concepts.


335
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,685 line:-2
With Siri Event Suggestions,
our goal is to make


336
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:02,022 line:-2
integrating your reservations
with the system really easy,


337
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:05,392 line:-2
and enable people to get
a ton of great benefits along the way.


338
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,095 line:-2
This feature is also powered
by the Intents framework.


339
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,897 line:-1
When a user views a reservation,


340
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,967 line:-2
your app should donate the details
of that reservation to the system.


341
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:18,005 line:-2
And we know you interact with customers
through many channels,


342
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,140 line:-1
like your website or even emails.


343
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,310 line:-1
So in iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur,


344
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:27,381 line:-2
we're introducing new ways to integrate
with Mail and Safari by using web markup.


345
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:32,519 line:-2
These were just a few of the technologies
which leverage these three concepts:


346
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,688 line:-1
define, learn and execute.


347
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,825 line:-2
By making friends with the system,
you can meet users where they are,


348
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,895 line:-2
and make it easier than ever
for people to get things done.


349
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,799 line:-2
Now I'll hand it back to Mark
to talk about next steps.


350
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,401 line:-1
Thanks, Sofiane.


351
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:50,604 line:-1
We've hammered home a few key ideas.


352
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,774 line:-1
The intelligent experience we strive for


353
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:56,577 line:-2
should make the everyday
easier for people.


354
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:02,349 line:0
It should help you get more value
out of your devices and your apps.


355
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,219 line:-1
It's about spending your time well,


356
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,855 line:-2
not spending your time
going through the motions,


357
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:12,125 line:-2
even if that motion is a swipe up to Home,
or a tap on an app icon,


358
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,127 line:-1
or a drill into a detail view.


359
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:17,698 line:-2
We want you to experience
your life as it is,


360
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,335 line:-2
fully in control,
not overly tethered to a device.


361
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,671 line:-1
Our apps and our devices


362
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,608 line:-2
feel magical not when they
force you to engage with them,


363
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:31,178 line:-2
but when they enhance the things
you do out there in the real world.


364
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,547 line:-1
But we can't do it on our own.


365
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,816 line:-1
It's only an intelligent system


366
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:40,787 line:-2
if each of its constituent parts works
in harmony, speaks the same language


367
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,391 line:-2
and helps people solve problems
they didn't even know they had.


368
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,160 line:-1
As JP put it so well,


369
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:50,230 line:-2
we want people to feel
like they have superpowers.


370
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:53,066 line:-2
And as developers and designers,
you have the opportunity


371
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,669 line:-2
to give that to the people
using your apps.


372
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:56,737 line:-1
So why don't you?


373
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:00,207 line:-2
You'll find links with resources
to other videos,


374
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:03,477 line:-2
including how to implement
the technologies you've seen here.


375
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,379 line:-1
No matter which you choose,


376
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:09,349 line:-2
just remember to define
your key features as intents,


377
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,252 line:-1
donate to the system to power suggestions,


378
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,689 line:-2
design a great voice experience
for people to use,


379
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:19,092 line:-2
but above all,
focus on how you can add value


380
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,229 line:-2
and make sure that people's time
is well spent.


381
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,931 line:-1
Thanks for watching,


382
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:27,601 line:-2
and I hope
you have a great rest of your WWDC.
