00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:06,974 line:-1
Hello, and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,444 line:0
Hi. I'm Tommy Pauly.


3
00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:15,282 line:0
Encrypted DNS is a key technology
for improving internet privacy.


4
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,385 line:-2
And it's supported natively
on Apple platforms


5
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:21,121 line:-2
as an underlying technology
that you as a developer


6
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,456 line:-1
can enable for users.


7
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,792 line:-1
If you provide a public DNS service,


8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,129 line:-2
you can write an app,
or a configuration profile,


9
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,198 line:-2
to let people use
your encrypted DNS server.


10
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:38,272 line:-2
You can also opt in to encrypted DNS
for specific connections


11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,673 line:-1
within your own apps.


12
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:44,978 line:-2
Before we dive into how you use
encrypted DNS on Apple platforms,


13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:49,716 line:-2
let's talk about what DNS is,
and why it matters for privacy.


14
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:53,053 line:-1
DNS is the domain name system.


15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,924 line:-2
It's what takes a name that you see
for a web page in Safari,


16
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:01,828 line:-2
and turns it into the actual IP addresses
of servers on the internet.


17
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,534 line:-2
Your devices are using DNS
every time you access the internet.


18
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:13,640 line:-2
When your app accesses a website,
the system asks a question, a DNS query,


19
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,743 line:-1
to turn that name into a set of addresses.


20
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,414 line:-2
Generally, the question is sent
to a DNS server


21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,516 line:-1
configured by your local network.


22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,219 line:-2
So where does privacy
come into the picture?


23
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,790 line:-2
One concern
is that DNS questions and answers


24
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:33,660 line:-2
are usually sent over
an unencrypted transport, UDP.


25
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:36,597 line:-2
That means that other devices
on the network


26
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,433 line:-2
can not only see
what names you're looking up,


27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,503 line:-2
but they can even interfere
with the answers.


28
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:47,908 line:-2
The other privacy concern
is that you may not trust the DNS resolver


29
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,309 line:-1
on your local network.


30
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:52,145 line:-1
If you've joined a public Wi-Fi network,


31
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:55,482 line:-2
your internet usage could be tracked
or blocked.


32
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,720 line:-2
So how does encrypted DNS
improve this situation?


33
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,990 line:-1
Encrypted DNS, simply put,


34
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:07,227 line:-2
is using encryption to protect
your DNS questions and answers.


35
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,498 line:-2
And if you don't trust
the network you're on,


36
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:16,937 line:-2
it can also involve sending your questions
to a DNS server that you do trust.


37
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,773 line:-1
Starting this year,


38
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,377 line:-2
Apple platforms natively support
encrypted DNS.


39
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,946 line:-1
There are two supported protocols.


40
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,983 line:-1
DNS over TLS, also called DoT,


41
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:34,321 line:-1
and DNS over HTTPS, also called DoH.


42
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,126 line:-2
Both of these use TLS
to encrypt DNS messages.


43
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:44,798 line:-2
DoH additionally uses HTTP
to improve performance.


44
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,836 line:-2
There are two ways that encrypted DNS
can be enabled.


45
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,139 line:-2
The first way is to choose
a single DNS server


46
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:55,676 line:-2
as the default resolver
for all apps on the system.


47
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,912 line:-1
If you provide a public DNS server,


48
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,248 line:-2
you can now write
a NetworkExtension app


49
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,084 line:-2
that configures the system
to use your server.


50
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,156 line:-2
Or, if you use mobile device management,
MDM,


51
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,825 line:-2
to configure enterprise settings
on devices,


52
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,263 line:-2
you can push down a profile
to configure encrypted DNS settings


53
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,698 line:-1
for your networks.


54
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:23,537 line:-2
The second way to enable encrypted DNS
is to opt in directly from an app.


55
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,040 line:-2
If you want your app
to use encrypted DNS,


56
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,643 line:-1
even if the rest of the system isn't yet,


57
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,482 line:-2
you can select a specific server to use
for some or all of your app's connections.


58
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:41,421 line:-2
Let's start by looking at how
the system-wide DNS settings work.


59
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:46,793 line:-2
System DNS settings can be configured
either by a NetworkExtension app


60
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,063 line:-1
that uses NEDNSSettingsManager,


61
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,868 line:-2
or an MDM profile that contains
a DNSSettings payload.


62
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:59,806 line:-2
Both of these methods allow you
to specify the same content.


63
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:05,579 line:-2
A DNS server configuration
that identifies which server to use,


64
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,648 line:-1
and which protocol the server supports,


65
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,184 line:-1
and a set of Network Rules


66
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,888 line:-2
that allows you to customize
when your DNS settings should apply.


67
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,091 line:-1
Let's look at how you specify


68
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,394 line:-2
the server configuration
using NetworkExtension.


69
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,867 line:-2
Use the shared
NEDNSSettingsManager object


70
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:30,571 line:-2
to first load in
any existing configuration.


71
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:38,879 line:-2
Next, you can define settings
for either a DNS over HTTPS server,


72
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,114 line:-1
or a DNS over TLS server.


73
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,284 line:-1
In this example, we're using DoH.


74
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,521 line:-2
You can provide
the server's IP addresses,


75
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,323 line:-1
which are optional,


76
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,226 line:-1
and the server URL, which is required.


77
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:56,997 line:-2
You set this object
into the "dnsSettings" property.


78
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:04,137 line:-2
You then call saveToPreferences
to apply the configuration to the system.


79
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:08,842 line:-2
At this point,
a user can enable your DNS server


80
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,377 line:-1
in the settings app.


81
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,516 line:-2
Next, let's look at the Network Rules part
of the configuration.


82
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:20,954 line:-2
Specifying Network Rules allows you
to ensure that your DNS settings


83
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,290 line:-1
are compatible with different networks.


84
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:26,126 line:-1
Encrypted DNS can be great for privacy,


85
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:30,297 line:-2
but a public DNS server isn't able
to resolve private names


86
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,566 line:-1
that are only known to local networks.


87
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,304 line:-2
For example, only a DNS server
on an enterprise Wi-Fi network


88
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:41,742 line:-2
can resolve certain private names
that are accessed by employees.


89
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:46,246 line:-2
Some aspects of compatibility
are handled for you automatically.


90
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,483 line:-2
For these, you don't need to specify
Network Rules.


91
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:52,019 line:-1
Captive network detection,


92
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,888 line:-2
like when someone logs on
to a cafÃ© network


93
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,558 line:-1
is automatically granted an exception.


94
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,828 line:-1
Similarly, if a VPN is active,


95
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,601 line:-2
resolution within the VPN tunnel
will use the VPN's DNS settings


96
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,237 line:-1
and not your system-wide settings.


97
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,975 line:-2
However,
handling cases like private names


98
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,944 line:-1
on enterprise Wi-Fi networks


99
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,580 line:-1
requires setting up Network Rules.


100
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,618 line:-2
Your Network Rules can define behavior
for specific network types,


101
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:29,156 line:-2
like Wi-Fi or cellular,
and specific Wi-Fi SSIDs.


102
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,592 line:-1
On matching networks,


103
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,962 line:-2
you can disable
your DNS settings entirely,


104
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:38,999 line:-2
or only grant exceptions
for specific private domains.


105
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,769 line:-2
Here's how to set up some Network Rules
in your app.


106
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:46,540 line:-2
Your app should allow users
to configure these kinds of rules.


107
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,777 line:-2
To create an exception
for a work network,


108
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:55,215 line:-2
define a rule for a Wi-Fi network
with a particular SSID.


109
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:59,019 line:-2
The list of connection rules
defines a domain,


110
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,489 line:-1
in this case, enterprise.example.net,


111
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,992 line:-1
that should not use your DNS settings.


112
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,796 line:-2
Overall, this rule says
that your DNS settings


113
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,065 line:-1
should be used on the work Wi-Fi network


114
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:16,069 line:-2
for everything other than
the private enterprise domain.


115
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:21,475 line:-2
You can also set up rules
to disable your DNS settings


116
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:25,646 line:-2
on an entire category of networks
using a Disconnect rule.


117
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:30,551 line:-2
Here, we're disabling DNS settings
on all cellular networks.


118
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:36,356 line:-2
The last rule you should set
should always be a catchall.


119
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,925 line:-1
In this case,


120
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:41,028 line:-2
let's make sure your DNS settings
are on by default


121
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,130 line:-1
by using a Connect rule.


122
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:48,735 line:-2
You store your Network Rules
as an ordered list,


123
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,938 line:-1
and then can save the configuration.


124
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:56,443 line:-2
Now we're ready to see
a DNS Settings app in action.


125
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:03,183 line:-2
Here's an example project that configures
the system-wide DNS settings.


126
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:07,754 line:-2
In our app,
we use NEDNSSettingsManager.


127
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,992 line:-2
Here, we can define
the server configuration,


128
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,232 line:-2
and we can also set up the Network Rules
based on the user preferences.


129
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:22,836 line:-2
This particular app supports enabling
or disabling


130
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,539 line:-1
on both cellular and Wi-Fi networks.


131
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,308 line:-1
Before we run the app,


132
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,445 line:-2
we need to make sure that
the DNS Settings capability


133
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,145 line:-1
is enabled in Xcode.


134
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,817 line:-2
To check this,
go to your Project Settings,


135
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,222 line:-1
and then over to Signing & Capabilities.


136
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:49,096 line:-2
The DNS Settings capability is one
of the NetworkExtension capabilities.


137
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,500 line:-2
And since we're configuring a protocol
that's supported by the system,


138
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,670 line:-2
we don't need to implement
an extension point.


139
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,939 line:-1
We only need to build an app.


140
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,675 line:-1
Let's look at that app now.


141
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:07,414 line:-2
When we run the app,
the configuration is installed,


142
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,082 line:-1
but not active immediately.


143
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,087 line:-2
We can enable or disable our settings
on Wi-Fi or cellular,


144
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:18,592 line:-2
and then enable the entire configuration
in the settings app.


145
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:25,098 line:-1
We go to Settings, General,


146
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,569 line:-1
and look at VPN & Network.


147
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:32,406 line:-1
Here, there's a section for DNS


148
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:36,076 line:-2
where your app will show up
once you've installed your configuration.


149
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,813 line:-1
If you select your settings,


150
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,683 line:-2
they will be automatically applied
to the whole system.


151
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,585 line:-1
And if you go back to your app,


152
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,421 line:-2
you can now see that the configuration
is active.


153
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,890 line:-1
That's all you have to do.


154
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:54,595 line:-2
At this point, your DNS settings
will apply to all apps on the system.


155
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,365 line:-1
Be aware that some networks may block


156
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,935 line:-2
using your encrypted DNS server
by policy.


157
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,304 line:-2
These networks might be trying
to filter traffic


158
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,306 line:-1
by looking at DNS queries.


159
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,645 line:-2
If this occurs, a Wi-Fi network is marked
with a privacy warning.


160
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:16,416 line:-2
Connections in apps will fail
rather than compromise your privacy.


161
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:21,121 line:-2
If you don't provide a DNS service
that the entire system can use,


162
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,124 line:-2
but you still want to use encrypted DNS
in your app,


163
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,461 line:-2
you can enable encrypted DNS
throughout your app,


164
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,429 line:-1
or for specific connections.


165
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:33,834 line:-2
This approach works
no matter what system APIs you use:


166
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:38,505 line:-2
URLSessionTasks,
Network framework connections,


167
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,475 line:-1
or POSIX APIs like getaddrinfo.


168
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:45,179 line:-2
Let's take a look
at enabling encrypted DNS


169
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,880 line:-1
with Network framework.


170
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,517 line:-2
You select your options
with a PrivacyContext.


171
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,487 line:-1
You create one PrivacyContext


172
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:57,124 line:-2
for every set of connections
that share DNS settings.


173
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,495 line:-1
When you require encryption,


174
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:05,699 line:-2
you can provide a DNS server
configuration to use as a fallback.


175
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,471 line:-2
That means that any system-wide
DNS configuration will take precedence,


176
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,575 line:-2
but your app's fallback
will kick in otherwise.


177
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:19,112 line:-1
Here, we use the URL of a DoH server.


178
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,518 line:-2
When you create parameters
for your connections,


179
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:27,688 line:-2
set the PrivacyContext
you created earlier.


180
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:33,260 line:-2
Then, start your connections,
and they will use encrypted DNS.


181
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,932 line:-2
You can also check
whether encrypted DNS


182
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,068 line:-1
was used on a given connection.


183
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:46,473 line:-2
Once a connection is ready,
request an EstablishmentReport.


184
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,278 line:-2
This report has a list
of resolution steps.


185
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,982 line:-2
You can check which protocol
was used for DNS:


186
00:11:55,916 --> 00:12:00,621 line:-1
HTTPS, TLS, UDP, or TCP.


187
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:06,393 line:-2
Note that answers that came from a cache
may not have any protocol set.


188
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,763 line:-2
If you want to use encrypted DNS
throughout your app,


189
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,900 line:-2
you can configure
the default PrivacyContext.


190
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,869 line:-1
This applies your configuration


191
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:19,206 line:-2
to every DNS resolution initiated
by your app,


192
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:24,077 line:-1
either when you use URLSessionTasks,


193
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:30,083 line:-2
or when you use lower-layer APIs
like getaddrinfo.


194
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,255 line:-2
Now you're ready
to try out encrypted DNS.


195
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,725 line:-1
If you provide a public DNS service,


196
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:42,462 line:-2
write an app
that uses NEDNSSettingsManager


197
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,997 line:-1
to deliver your settings.


198
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:48,235 line:-1
If you have an enterprise MDM solution,


199
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:52,239 line:-2
use profiles to enable encrypted DNS
on your networks.


200
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,577 line:-2
And if you want to opt in directly
from your app,


201
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,947 line:-2
adopt PrivacyContexts
in Network framework.
