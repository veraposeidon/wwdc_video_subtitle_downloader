00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:06,740 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,743 line:-1
Hi. Today we're gonna talk about


3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,080 line:-2
creating great enterprise applications
with Apple technology,


4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,015 line:0
and with me is Aaron Levie,
the founder and CEO of Box.


5
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,384 line:0
Welcome, Aaron.


6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,586 line:0
Hey, Mike. Great to be here.
Thanks a lot for having me.


7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,622 line:0
Right now,
it's a very, very interesting time


8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:26,193 line:-2
with remote working in COVID
and some of the things it's requiring.


9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,662 line:-2
Aaron, what are you hearing
from your customers


10
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,231 line:-2
in terms of this new world
that we're entering?


11
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:35,068 line:-2
Obviously, this has been
just a complete transformation


12
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:40,707 line:-2
in how people work in organizations
of all sizes all around the world,


13
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:45,913 line:-2
obviously, brought on by
an incredibly tragic and difficult event


14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,249 line:-2
with massive health care
and economic impact,


15
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:52,186 line:-1
but what it really did was cause companies


16
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:56,123 line:-2
to have to accelerate
their digital transformation strategies,


17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,359 line:-2
in some cases,
by multiple years or a decade.


18
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,297 line:-2
So, one example is, we have a project
going on right now at Box


19
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,899 line:-2
which is to improve
the performance of our application.


20
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:11,138 line:-2
So, we want every single part of our app
to be able to work in less than a second,


21
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:14,174 line:-2
whether you're on the Web or on mobile,
wherever you are.


22
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:18,445 line:-2
And normally, that would be five, ten,
15 people working on that project


23
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,747 line:-2
in different meetings,
on whiteboards at the office,


24
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,983 line:-2
and that was what we thought of
as productivity.


25
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,420 line:-2
That's what we thought of
as creativity and collaboration.


26
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:31,058 line:-2
Now, when we're in a virtual environment,
we have 100 people in a Slack channel


27
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,327 line:-1
that are all contributing ideas


28
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,663 line:-2
of how we can get to sub-second latency
across our application.


29
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,265 line:-1
And so we can now include


30
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,801 line:-2
people from all different departments,
all different teams,


31
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:43,003 line:-2
people that normally wouldn't have
thought of themselves


32
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,672 line:-2
as performance engineers,
can now contribute ideas


33
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,942 line:-1
to this way of actually driving updates


34
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,744 line:-2
and pretty important upgrades
to our software.


35
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:54,982 line:-2
And so, a lot of opportunity, I think,
for digital transformation today,


36
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,252 line:-2
and really excited
to have that conversation with you.


37
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,955 line:-2
And, obviously, with Apple
being so important in this space,


38
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,223 line:-1
it's great to be here.


39
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,559 line:-1
I'm also, frankly, personally, curious


40
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,562 line:-2
what you guys are doing as well
in this environment.


41
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,464 line:-1
Yeah, we'll talk a bit more about that.


42
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,832 line:-1
One of the things that we're seeing,


43
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:16,236 line:-2
especially in
this remote work environment right now,


44
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,839 line:-1
is companies like IBM, and Oracle,


45
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,441 line:-2
and others that are Mac,
that use a lot of Macs,


46
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:26,113 line:-2
really want zero-touch deployment
using Apple Business Manager,


47
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,184 line:-2
so they can ship that device to that
new employee or the existing employee,


48
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,885 line:-1
and it's all set up for them.


49
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,855 line:-2
And so, I think there's a general trend
that we're seeing of,


50
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:39,059 line:-2
how do we actually enable
that remote worker to be more effective


51
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:43,096 line:-2
across the board, across all our devices,
across all of our products.


52
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:48,035 line:-1
And so, in this new world that we're in,


53
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:52,072 line:-2
which is probably
not going to go back to the old way,


54
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,977 line:-2
what is Box doing to kind of advance
on the product side to realize this?


55
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,213 line:-2
So, we think that the future
is a hybrid one,


56
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,216 line:-2
where offices are going to be playing
an important role.


57
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,952 line:-2
At the same time, we think
that there's going to be more flexibility,


58
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,721 line:-2
more agility
introduced to the ways that we work


59
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:11,491 line:-2
that give people more choice and allow
them to be more productive from anywhere.


60
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,395 line:-2
And so, the center of that, that ability
to create a hybrid environment


61
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,898 line:-2
where we can work from the office
or work from anywhere,


62
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,466 line:-1
the cloud is at the center of that,


63
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:24,505 line:-2
and delivering a modern digital workplace
is at the center of those two worlds.


64
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,173 line:-1
And so, we think a digital workplace


65
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,209 line:-2
is going to bridge the physical
and the virtual in the future.


66
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,744 line:-1
At the center of that digital workplace,


67
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,813 line:-2
we need modern technologies
to be able to do our work.


68
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,184 line:-2
We need to be able to have modern devices
like MacBooks and iPhones and iPads.


69
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:39,820 line:-2
We need to be able to be
on modern and secure networks.


70
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,389 line:-2
We need to be able to protect our identity
from the cloud,


71
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,524 line:-1
so we can work from anywhere.


72
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,325 line:-2
We need to be able
to collaborate in real time,


73
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,593 line:-1
to be able to hop on a video call,


74
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,663 line:-2
whether that's WebEx or Zoom
or Google Hangouts.


75
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,901 line:-2
We need to be able to chat and communicate
on products like Slack and other tools.


76
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,739 line:-2
And our job at Box is, we want to be
the best way to manage content securely


77
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,807 line:-2
in that remote
and distributed way of working.


78
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,377 line:-2
And so, anytime you want to
be able to access files,


79
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,213 line:-2
anytime you want to be able to
share files securely with your partners


80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,815 line:-2
and your colleagues and people in
and outside of your business,


81
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,251 line:-2
we want to be the best way
to do that in the cloud.


82
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,588 line:-2
Fortunately, we work with
nearly 100,000 customers globally.


83
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,858 line:-2
We're in about 70% of the Fortune 500,
and we have amazing organizations


84
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,793 line:-2
that are trying to enable
this new digital way of working,


85
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:26,433 line:-2
where on a moment's notice, you can hop on
a new MacBook or jump on an iPad


86
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,802 line:-2
and be able to get to
all of the data in your enterprise


87
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,838 line:-2
that you have access to
in a very secure way,


88
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,440 line:-2
and be able to securely collaborate
and share with the people


89
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,209 line:-1
that matter most in your business.


90
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,679 line:-2
So we've really pivoted our road map
and pivoted our strategy


91
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,582 line:-2
to help our customers
with these remote work use cases


92
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,517 line:-1
to really be able to help customers


93
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:46,753 line:-2
drive a new level of
digital transformation in their business.


94
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,089 line:-2
There's sort of two big pillars
that we think about.


95
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:52,292 line:-2
The first is the pillar of,
how do you enable collaboration


96
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:56,530 line:-2
and modern work to get done
in this new distributed environment


97
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,833 line:-2
where you might go into the office or you
might work from anywhere instantaneously?


98
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,769 line:-2
And that's technology
and products and services


99
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,905 line:-2
like the ability
to collaborate in real time.


100
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:10,410 line:-2
We are really excited. We're working with
an all-new version of our iPad app


101
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,012 line:-1
that will have Apple Pencil support.


102
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,147 line:-2
So you'll be able to annotate
in real time on a document


103
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:17,017 line:-2
and be able to make sure
that those annotations are seen on the Web


104
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:21,054 line:-2
or on the desktop from other people that
need to be able to collaborate with you.


105
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,091 line:-2
We're working on all-new ways to be able
to securely share content


106
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,593 line:-1
on mobile devices in a very seamless way.


107
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,963 line:-2
So, we're really, really excited about
the innovation that's coming


108
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,233 line:-2
for helping remote workers
and being able to work in this modern way.


109
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,601 line:-1
At the same time,


110
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,771 line:-2
we're also really excited
about the number of business processes


111
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,742 line:-2
that we're seeing that are now going
to be digitized for the future of work,


112
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,177 line:-1
and that's in a range of industries.


113
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:47,114 line:-2
From banking to health care to education
to life sciences and more.


114
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,449 line:-2
So that's how
we've sort of pivoted our strategy


115
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,919 line:-2
to make sure that we can
help support customers right now.


116
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,988 line:-2
And in that strategy,
could you elaborate a little bit more


117
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:58,725 line:-2
around Apple technology and how you
think about that in your business


118
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,594 line:-2
as well as
what you're hearing from your customers?


119
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,030 line:-2
Fundamentally, we think
that there's a bridging


120
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,667 line:-2
of the consumer-grade technology
that we're used to in our personal lives,


121
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,069 line:-2
whether it's a device like a MacBook
or an iPhone,


122
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,505 line:-2
as well as the cloud services
and the security


123
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,106 line:-1
that we need from an enterprise context.


124
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,843 line:-2
And that's really where, obviously,
products like Box comes in.


125
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,413 line:-2
So, we are building across
all the core platforms.


126
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,183 line:-1
Across Apple products, our vision is that


127
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,552 line:-2
we want to deliver the most seamless way
of getting work done.


128
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,487 line:-1
Whether you're leveraging a MacBook


129
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,757 line:-2
or whether you want to be able to
collaborate securely on an iOS device,


130
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,228 line:-2
we make sure
that we have an iOS-first strategy


131
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,263 line:-2
in terms of
how we design our applications,


132
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,999 line:-2
making sure that we're leveraging
the best user experiences.


133
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,936 line:-2
And again, fundamentally thinking about
this as a consumer-grade experience.


134
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:46,340 line:-2
How do we bring consumer-grade experiences
into the enterprise,


135
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,709 line:-2
so people,
no matter where they're working from,


136
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,144 line:-2
they don't have to worry about
all the complexity the support


137
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,781 line:-2
and all the challenges that you might
have to have in a normal IT environment.


138
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,885 line:-2
And that's really going to require
consumer-grade solutions


139
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,887 line:-2
to being able to enable
this new way of working.


140
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,855 line:-2
Mm-hmm. And I think
that's one of the reasons


141
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,357 line:-1
why our companies work so well together,


142
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,793 line:-2
because we are
obviously very consumer-focused.


143
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,264 line:-2
We obviously have this focus
on the enterprise as well that's emerging.


144
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,633 line:-1
We want to bring that consumer DNA


145
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,170 line:-2
and that kind of consumer thinking
in the products to enterprise products.


146
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:20,040 line:-2
So, if I think about even the things
that we're working on right now,


147
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,343 line:-2
it's expanding
on zero-touch Mac deployments,


148
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:28,482 line:-2
it's expanding on auto-advance to
allow an organization to order computers,


149
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,984 line:-2
so once they arrive,
they can just plug them right in


150
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:37,324 line:-2
and instantly, that employee is actually
basically working and functioning.


151
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:40,360 line:-2
And then also been realizing that
there are requirements in the enterprise


152
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,461 line:-1
that are really unique.


153
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,198 line:-2
Like updates,
being able to control updates,


154
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,899 line:-1
when they happen, when they don't,


155
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:50,237 line:-2
and being able to recognize the fact that,
unlike the consumer space,


156
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,807 line:-2
that enterprises have a different tempo
or different kind of speed


157
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,742 line:-1
that they're actually iterating on.


158
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,878 line:-1
So, just a personal example.


159
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:02,316 line:-2
So, when we first went to
a remote work environment even at Box--


160
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,985 line:-1
We have only 2,000 employees,


161
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,254 line:-2
so it was easier for us
and a little bit smoother.


162
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,624 line:-2
I remember when I needed to set up
my new iMac


163
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:14,795 line:-2
to make sure that I had all the right
video setup and the right environment,


164
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:21,201 line:-2
it took me, literally, maybe five minutes
from booting up a brand-new machine


165
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:25,572 line:-2
to having access to every single
critical application in our business


166
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,976 line:-2
and being able to work securely
with all the people that I needed.


167
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:34,448 line:-2
And so, that ability to be able to work
seamlessly in the cloud on any device,


168
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,482 line:-1
being able to work in any environment


169
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,352 line:-2
and instantly boot up
the technology that you need


170
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,321 line:-1
from a fresh start of a computer,


171
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,724 line:-2
that's the power of what
consumerization of technology


172
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,092 line:-1
is going to look like in the future.


173
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,427 line:-2
So that's something
that we're really excited about.


174
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,264 line:-2
And again,
as a personal user of these products,


175
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,267 line:-1
I can see it firsthand of being able to go


176
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:58,205 line:-2
from zero to your entire IT stack
in five minutes on a new device:


177
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,706 line:-1
That's what the future of work is.


178
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:04,444 line:-2
Mm-hmm. What can you be-- If you want to
give guidance, let's say, to an enterprise


179
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,114 line:-1
that's out in the audience listening,


180
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,116 line:-1
what kind of guidance can you give


181
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:14,621 line:-2
on how they can better deal with
this rapidly-changing landscape?


182
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:18,292 line:-2
Yeah, I think,
regardless of industry, again,


183
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:22,162 line:-2
we're seeing this across
every single sector.


184
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:27,034 line:-2
I think this is a catalyst
for digital transformation


185
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,069 line:-1
that is going to accelerate projects


186
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,638 line:-2
that maybe were
two or three or five, ten years out,


187
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,040 line:-1
and that's going to start to happen.


188
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,843 line:-2
Those projects are gonna be executed
in the coming months and quarters.


189
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:40,013 line:-2
So, I personally think
this is one of the best times ever


190
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,018 line:-2
to be in either information technology or
developer working on enterprise software,


191
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,222 line:-2
because of the fact
that every single business


192
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,124 line:-2
is going to have to rewrite
their underlying processes


193
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,961 line:-2
and their experiences
for both employees and their customers.


194
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,697 line:-2
And so if you think about
working backwards from--


195
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:01,935 line:-2
Instead of looking at our business process
that got developed over the 20th century


196
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:05,239 line:-2
and saying, "What could that look like
in the digital world?"


197
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,208 line:-2
we have an opportunity now, from scratch,
to say in the 21st century,


198
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,776 line:-1
"What should that experience look like?"


199
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,411 line:-1
When you can really kind of work backwards


200
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,047 line:-2
from what's the right way
to deliver education in the future,


201
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,283 line:-2
what's the right way
to deliver health care in the future,


202
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,051 line:-2
the right way
to be able to serve customers


203
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,921 line:-2
if you're a bank and you want to
automate their onboarding process


204
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,956 line:-2
and make sure
that they never have to send you paper


205
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,725 line:-1
or do signatures in the future?


206
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,960 line:-2
So, I think developers
are going to be at the center


207
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,530 line:-2
of being able to transform
both the future of work,


208
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,932 line:-2
and the future
of a lot of these enterprise experiences.


209
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,001 line:-2
So, I think a couple things
that come to mind.


210
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,903 line:-1
First is, think like a consumer.


211
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,273 line:-2
When you're developing software
for the enterprise, think consumer first.


212
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,842 line:-2
We are all consumers
in our personal lives,


213
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,411 line:-2
and yet, somehow,
when we go to the office,


214
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,879 line:-1
we sort of give up on thinking


215
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,981 line:-2
that we have to deliver
consumer-grade experiences.


216
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,383 line:-1
We sort of have this feeling that,


217
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,919 line:-2
"Okay. Well, enterprise software
can be slow and complicated


218
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,453 line:-1
because, oh, it's enterprise software."


219
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,656 line:-2
Well, that makes no sense
in the 21st century.


220
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,392 line:-2
We should have every single experience
in the enterprise


221
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,493 line:-1
be able to match and keep up


222
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,528 line:-2
with experiences that we have
in our personal lives.


223
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:02,596 line:-1
That's the first thing.


224
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,065 line:-2
The second thing is,
I think we have to be thinking about


225
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,201 line:-1
a mobile-first and digital-first world.


226
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,503 line:-2
When you think about
the kinds of products that you deploy,


227
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,005 line:-2
when you think about the kind
of user experiences that get created,


228
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:15,108 line:-2
we know that
these are going to be the ways


229
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,543 line:-1
that people want to be able to work.


230
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,179 line:-2
They want to be able
to load up their iPhone quickly,


231
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,748 line:-2
be able to make sure
that they can use these applications


232
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,383 line:-1
in a very, very seamless way.


233
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,422 line:-2
I'm spending more time on my iPhone
in my work-from-home environment


234
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,690 line:-1
than I am even on my computer


235
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:33,126 line:-2
and it's because, in some of these cases,
it's just easier to be able to communicate


236
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,995 line:-1
and chat and collaborate and get on video


237
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,798 line:-2
and open up a document
when you're on an iPad or an iPhone.


238
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:41,368 line:-2
And so we want to be able to make sure
that we're delivering amazing experiences.


239
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:45,806 line:-2
I think the third thing is, really,
to be thinking about security, by design,


240
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,808 line:-2
built into the products
that you're creating.


241
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,078 line:-2
We know that the world is dealing
with a tremendous amount of challenge


242
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,982 line:-2
around data security and cyber security
and data privacy,


243
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,818 line:-2
so really making sure
that the software that we build


244
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,988 line:-2
has security built into the core,
data privacy built into the core,


245
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,423 line:-2
this is what's going to differentiate
all of our applications


246
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,125 line:-1
that we create for enterprises,


247
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,294 line:-2
and it's the only way
that we can realistically go


248
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,897 line:-2
and serve at hospitals
and government agencies,


249
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:13,500 line:-2
life sciences organizations,
banks, universities,


250
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,036 line:-1
K-12 education and so much more.


251
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,672 line:-2
So, think like a consumer
when you're building software,


252
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,908 line:-2
make sure that security
is built in by design.


253
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:24,344 line:-2
And again, I think we have
an opportunity to rebuild


254
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:28,749 line:-2
much of the software
and the experiences for the 21st century.


255
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:34,354 line:-2
And what have you found
as you focus on security and privacy,


256
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,424 line:-2
how you leverage with
the Apple technology stack, let's say,


257
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,426 line:-1
to enable that for your customers?


258
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,728 line:-1
Yeah, I mean, first and foremost,


259
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:45,532 line:-2
the underlying capabilities
that Apple devices are providing


260
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,236 line:-2
our users and our developers
is obviously fundamental.


261
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:53,740 line:-2
So, whether it's the encryption
that we have on an iOS device,


262
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:58,111 line:-2
whether it's the security and safety
that's offered on a Mac device,


263
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,415 line:-2
this is why we recommend these platforms
to our customers.


264
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,818 line:-2
We're leveraging a lot of the native APIs
and core experiences


265
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,253 line:-1
from a security standpoint,


266
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,488 line:-1
and we're really excited about, again,


267
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,791 line:-2
whether it's MDM technology
and so much more,


268
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:14,294 line:-2
to be able to plug in to more and more
of these experiences over time.


269
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,998 line:-2
What are the some of the challenges
that you're running into as you--


270
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:22,135 line:-2
I mean, this vision that you paint,
I totally agree with,


271
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,271 line:-2
in the enterprise,
of where the trends are going,


272
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:29,676 line:-2
but what are the technical challenges
you said that you see on the horizon


273
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:33,514 line:-2
that you would
challenge the audience to focus on,


274
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,649 line:-1
or even ourselves here at Apple?


275
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:42,389 line:-2
Well, I think we've got a lot of--
certainly a lot of legacy technology


276
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:46,660 line:-2
that most enterprises are dealing with,
and any large business,


277
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:50,430 line:-2
whether it's 5,000 employees
or 100,000 employees and more,


278
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:54,568 line:-2
they're dealing with this duality of
there's so much innovation,


279
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:57,171 line:-2
so many modern experiences
they want to go create,


280
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,406 line:-2
and at the same time,
they've a lot of legacy infrastructure.


281
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,241 line:-1
They've a lot of legacy processes.


282
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,444 line:-1
So, our general view is starting with


283
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,680 line:-2
some of the highest leverage parts
of the business.


284
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:09,850 line:-2
The things that touch the end user,
the employee, the customer,


285
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:10,918 line:-1
really start there,


286
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:14,087 line:-2
and make sure that we're focusing
on those types of user experiences.


287
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,224 line:-2
I think we have to build toward
a cloud-first architecture,


288
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,761 line:-2
a digital-first experience,
oftentimes a mobile-first architecture


289
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,529 line:-2
in terms of the software
that we're building,


290
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:25,566 line:-2
and I would just challenge
every enterprise software developer,


291
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:31,205 line:-2
every IT organization to think in terms
of those ways of delivering technology.


292
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,775 line:-2
I think obviously, Apple has been
an incredible partner in this ecosystem.


293
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:37,477 line:-2
Apple probably single-handedly
has done more


294
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,247 line:-2
to modernize people's thinking
about enterprise software,


295
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,748 line:-1
especially because of iOS devices


296
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:44,251 line:-2
that caused the industry to say,
"Wait a second.


297
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:48,055 line:-2
Why do we have to have bad technology
in our business environment?


298
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,123 line:-2
Why can't we use MacBooks,
why can't we use iPhones,


299
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,191 line:-1
why can't we use iPads?"


300
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,160 line:-2
And that's caused
a different level of thinking


301
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:56,163 line:-2
about the software that
we go out and build for our customers,


302
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,865 line:-1
and I think it's been a huge boon.


303
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,234 line:-2
There's a lot of things
I think we all need to be doing


304
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,569 line:-1
around deeper interoperability,


305
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:06,306 line:-2
better seamlessness of experiences
as more data moves to the cloud.


306
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,109 line:-2
It behooves
all enterprise software developers


307
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:13,146 line:-2
to create a level of interoperability
so customers can have choice,


308
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,349 line:-1
so they can have integrated experiences.


309
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,585 line:-2
I think there's going to be
some exciting, new--


310
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:21,088 line:-2
On the forefront of security
that we're going to see,


311
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,923 line:-1
especially what Apple is delivering,


312
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,559 line:-2
but I think we have to make sure
that security is baked into


313
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:26,927 line:-1
all of the technology that we use.


314
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,796 line:-2
It used to be that
if you were a software developer,


315
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:33,100 line:-2
you thought it was somebody else's job
to handle data security.


316
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,836 line:-2
It was the device
or it was the network provider


317
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,138 line:-2
or it was just
a security technology vendor.


318
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,740 line:-1
That's not the case in the 21st century.


319
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,875 line:-2
If you're developing software
for the enterprise,


320
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,077 line:-2
security has to be baked
into every single thing that you do


321
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,346 line:-1
and every single way that you handle data.


322
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,382 line:-2
So I think there's going to be
a lot of change.


323
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,717 line:-2
I think we're going to see more change
in the next couple of years


324
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,754 line:-2
in the software ecosystem than
we have in the past couple of decades,


325
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,390 line:-2
and that's because we know
that we're at the start


326
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,794 line:-2
of another wave of digital change
happening in these industries.


327
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:04,431 line:-2
In this mobile-first approach
that you're suggesting,


328
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:08,035 line:-2
how do microservices
and continuous integration development


329
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:12,673 line:-2
play into that
from a culture and a process perspective?


330
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:17,811 line:-2
Fundamentally, I think you have to be
oriented toward microservices


331
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:20,214 line:-2
because of the fact
that there's too many capabilities


332
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,149 line:-2
that you need to be delivering
to your customers,


333
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:26,653 line:-2
and so we have to be able to deliver
individual innovations


334
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,723 line:-2
that get updated for our customers
on a continuous basis


335
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,725 line:-2
because of how quickly
the world is changing.


336
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,293 line:-1
And so, when we think about releases,


337
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,696 line:-2
we don't think about releases
in quarters or years,


338
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:38,198 line:-2
as you maybe would have
five or ten or 20 years ago


339
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,100 line:-1
in traditional enterprise software.


340
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,369 line:-1
We think about releases on a daily basis.


341
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:46,006 line:-2
And we think about releases not only
when we're going to ship native code


342
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,141 line:-2
that people are going to update
on their iOS devices,


343
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,311 line:-2
but what cloud services
are we now implementing in the background


344
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,147 line:-2
that's going to make our software
better, faster, simpler, easier,


345
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,883 line:-1
more secure for our customers?


346
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,352 line:-2
The only way to really do that
is if you have a modern architecture,


347
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,721 line:-1
if you can run on top of microservices,


348
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,857 line:-2
if you can separate out
the core components of your application,


349
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:06,859 line:-2
if you can make sure you're doing
continuous development and integration.


350
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,428 line:-1
All of those things are fundamental


351
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,830 line:-2
to a modern way
of developing enterprise software.


352
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,967 line:-2
Now, realizing there's a lot of sessions
at WWDC


353
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,637 line:-2
around new frameworks
or updates to existing frameworks.


354
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,173 line:-1
This conversation's a little different


355
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,775 line:-2
'cause we're talking about the cloud
and the endpoints.


356
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:25,479 line:-2
What are the other considerations
that developers need to have


357
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:30,751 line:-2
for how to design those cloud services
that the devices are connecting into?


358
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:34,988 line:-2
Yeah, I think
we're definitely in a new era


359
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,924 line:-1
of the client server architecture, right?


360
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,928 line:-2
What logic do you put in the cloud,
what logic do you have on the device,


361
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,396 line:-1
how do you leverage and take advantage


362
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,698 line:-2
of the native characteristics
of these devices,


363
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:48,769 line:-2
so where is the moment where something
like Core ML starts to make sense,


364
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:52,039 line:-2
to be able to have
device-level machine learning


365
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,775 line:-1
and leverage the processing power


366
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,044 line:-2
and the security and privacy power
of the device?


367
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,445 line:-1
What things do you run in the cloud?


368
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:01,682 line:-2
And we're always having
that sort of debate internally.


369
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,852 line:-1
What belongs at the end user level,


370
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,588 line:-2
whether that's a security reason
or performance reason


371
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:11,158 line:-2
and what things do we want to make sure
that we're leveraging the cloud for?


372
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:12,559 line:-1
We have a lot of services


373
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:17,497 line:-2
where we'll even have in the browser
on a MacBook or any device,


374
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:21,001 line:-2
we'll have the browser be doing processing
that maybe a couple of years ago


375
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,804 line:-2
we would have done
as server-side processing,


376
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,941 line:-2
but because we've seen such improvements
in HTML5 and modern technology,


377
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,109 line:-1
we can go improve that.


378
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,844 line:-1
Same thing on the iOS device, right?


379
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:34,414 line:-2
So, what things can we do
local to that device


380
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,718 line:-2
so we can improve the user experience,
make something snappier, make it faster,


381
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,220 line:-1
cache it in a more efficient way?


382
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,023 line:-2
And I think, again,
it behooves all software developers


383
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,591 line:-1
to get clear on that architecture,


384
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:48,262 line:-2
because it's not a given that the way
you would've done something ten years ago


385
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,630 line:-1
when the devices were slower,


386
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:52,299 line:-2
maybe they didn't have
as much compute capacity,


387
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:53,700 line:-1
maybe we didn't have Core ML.


388
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,636 line:-1
You don't want to be designing things


389
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,638 line:-2
in the same way you would have
maybe ten years ago


390
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,040 line:-2
today, when there's all-new services
that you can be leveraging.


391
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:01,842 line:-1
I think taking a step back,


392
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:05,913 line:-2
taking inventory
of what's possible now in 2020,


393
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,648 line:-1
and how we should be building software


394
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:10,984 line:-2
is a really big opportunity
for, I think, all developers.


395
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:12,886 line:-1
And then bringing that full circle


396
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:16,456 line:-2
to the trend towards working from home,
being forced,


397
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:20,894 line:-2
and then probably having a world where
we have this hybrid, as you point out.


398
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:24,398 line:-2
What are the areas that you feel like
are not being met?


399
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:30,337 line:-2
So, I think there's a huge opportunity
for developers right now to say


400
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:35,242 line:-2
what is work going to look like
in the future


401
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:39,279 line:-2
when, on a moment's notice,
you might want to pull up any device,


402
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,149 line:-2
you might be in any location,
you might be on any network,


403
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:44,151 line:-2
and you want to be able
to collaborate in real time


404
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:45,686 line:-1
with anybody in your business?


405
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,288 line:-2
I think there's going to be
a wave of innovation


406
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:53,460 line:-2
that reimagines the combination
of synchronous work and asynchronous work


407
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,528 line:-1
the way that--


408
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,363 line:-1
How do you start to approximate


409
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,732 line:-2
some of the ways
that we used to maybe work in an office,


410
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,967 line:-1
but do that virtually?


411
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,804 line:-2
How do you start to hop on a video call
within, literally, a couple seconds


412
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,706 line:-2
without having to schedule
the full meeting?


413
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:08,909 line:-2
How do you collaborate in real time
on documents


414
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:12,312 line:-2
and be able to leverage new ways
of sharing information


415
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:17,317 line:-2
across just a plethora
of devices and networks?


416
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:21,088 line:-2
So I think this is going to be
an amazing opportunity right now


417
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,323 line:-2
for software developers
both in large enterprises


418
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,525 line:-1
as well as start-ups


419
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,960 line:-2
to start to think about
the new characteristics of work,


420
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:30,764 line:-2
the ways that we can deliver
a modern digital workplace,


421
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:33,867 line:-2
to be able to get people on the same page,
whether that's on video


422
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:36,003 line:-2
or whether that's in documents
or whether that's in chat


423
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,739 line:-2
or whether that's in other ways
of sharing knowledge,


424
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:43,110 line:-2
and there's going to be all-new companies
that we look back on five years from now


425
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:47,147 line:-2
that will be the next era
of Slacks and Zooms of the world


426
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:49,483 line:-2
that get created
because of this new way of working


427
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,152 line:-2
and it's going to be incredibly exciting
to see what emerges


428
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:53,787 line:-1
in the coming quarters and years.


429
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:55,722 line:-2
Yeah, I know.
It's a really remarkable time,


430
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:58,425 line:-1
this convergence of home and work.


431
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:00,427 line:-1
Truly. It's blended now.


432
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:04,731 line:-2
And there's gonna be a whole new set
of experience and applications


433
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:06,466 line:-1
and services that emerge from that.


434
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,502 line:-1
We definitely share a similar vision.


435
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:11,004 line:-2
Well, Aaron, thank you so much
for your time today


436
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:13,473 line:-2
and hopefully
you all enjoyed this discussion


437
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,077 line:-2
around creating great enterprise
applications with Apple technology.


438
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:18,779 line:-2
-Thanks, Mike.
-Thanks.
