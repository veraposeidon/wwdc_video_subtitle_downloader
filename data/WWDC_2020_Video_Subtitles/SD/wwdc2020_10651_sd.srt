Hello and welcome to WWDC.


3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:12,312 line:0
Hi, everyone. Welcome to our session
on "What's New in App Store Connect."


4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,014 line:0
My name is Daniel Miao,


5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,917 line:0
and I'm an engineering manager
on the App Store Connect team.


6
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,419 line:-1
So, as with every WWDC,


7
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,855 line:-2
we have a ton
of exciting new features for you.


8
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:24,825 line:-2
Today, I'll talk to you
about how to use App Store Connect


9
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,727 line:-1
to configure and test app clips,


10
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,763 line:-2
as well as how to take advantage
of new Game Center features


11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,332 line:-2
like Challenges
and Recurring Leaderboards.


12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,169 line:-2
I'm also gonna give you
some exciting updates


13
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:39,106 line:-2
about both in-app purchases
and the App Store Connect API.


14
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,176 line:-1
So, as you heard in the Keynote,


15
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,978 line:-2
an app clip is essentially
a small part of your app


16
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,614 line:-2
that's discoverable
at the moment you need it


17
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,250 line:-2
and is focused on performing
a specific task.


18
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,020 line:-1
From a technical standpoint,


19
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,690 line:-2
an app clip is simply a binary
that you package alongside your app


20
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:59,126 line:-1
and runs on-device just like an app.


21
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,931 line:-2
The app clip binary is delivered
to the device when it's invoked,


22
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,767 line:-1
and we limit the size of the binary


23
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:10,671 line:-2
to make sure the invocation
of the app clip feels very fast.


24
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:15,108 line:-2
Now, in order to deliver
a great app clip experience,


25
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,477 line:-2
there are a few major areas
to think about.


26
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,781 line:-1
First, you wanna beta test your app clip


27
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,951 line:-2
to make sure you're providing
a solid user experience.


28
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,989 line:-2
Then, when you're ready to release
your app clip to the rest of your users,


29
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,024 line:-1
you'll set up app clip card metadata


30
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,760 line:-2
to provide meaningful information
to your customers


31
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,029 line:-1
about what your app clip does.


32
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,068 line:-2
And finally, you'll need to properly
define domain associations


33
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,136 line:-1
to enable your app clips to launch.


34
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,074 line:-2
But before we get into these,
I wanna spend a few minutes


35
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,878 line:-2
talking about a concept
that's foundational to all of these areas,


36
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,049 line:-2
and that's what an app clip invocation is
and why it's important.


37
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,754 line:-2
I'll start off with an example
of invoking an app clip from Safari.


38
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:04,625 line:-2
Here,
we're on the forestexplorer.org website.


39
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:09,029 line:-2
The first thing you'll notice
is this banner at the top of the page.


40
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,765 line:-1
We call this the Safari app clip banner.


41
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:15,302 line:-2
It appears when a website
is associated with an app clip.


42
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,272 line:-1
In Safari, we invoke the app clip


43
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,807 line:-2
by tapping the "Open" button
in this banner.


44
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,678 line:0
This brings up what we call
the app clip card.


45
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,581 line:0
This card contains more information
about the app clip


46
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,217 line:0
before it's launched on the user's device.


47
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,253 line:0
Tapping the "Open" button
on the app clip card


48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,088 line:0
launches the app clip itself.


49
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,225 line:-1
And once your app clip is running,


50
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,994 line:-1
a link to your full app on the App Store


51
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,331 line:-2
will briefly appear
at the top of the screen.


52
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,135 line:-1
There are many ways to invoke an app clip.


53
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:51,672 line:-2
As you just saw,
an app clip can be invoked from Safari.


54
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,642 line:-2
But app clips can also be invoked
from Messages, Maps,


55
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,214 line:-2
via NFC tags, and QR codes,
and based on a user's location.


56
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,217 line:-1
But no matter how it's invoked,


57
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,319 line:-1
almost every app clip invocation


58
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,622 line:-1
will be associated with an invocation URL.


59
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,492 line:-1
A simple example of an invocation URL


60
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,263 line:-2
is the URL of the web page
that we just saw in our last example,


61
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,098 line:-1
forestexplorer.org.


62
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,169 line:-2
A second example
is a piece of functionality


63
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,404 line:-1
that we're introducing to Forest Explorer.


64
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:29,109 line:-2
Users will be able to use our app clip
to reserve camp sites from Apple Maps.


65
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:35,115 line:-2
Here you see the invocation URL
camp.forestexplorer.org/reserve


66
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,151 line:-2
and then the ID of the campground
for the reservation.


67
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,190 line:-2
Now, users will also be able to check in
to the campsites that they reserve


68
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:46,126 line:-1
by scanning an NFC tag at the campsite.


69
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,396 line:-2
This URL contains the ID
of the campground,


70
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,232 line:-1
along with the specific campsite number.


71
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,304 line:-2
So, the invocation URL
serves two main purposes.


72
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,974 line:-2
The first is when an app clip
is displayed,


73
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,377 line:-1
the invocation URL is used to determine


74
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,647 line:-2
what metadata is shown
on the app clip card.


75
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,852 line:-2
Then, when the app clip is launched
on the user's device,


76
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,922 line:-2
the invocation URL
is passed into the app clip


77
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,457 line:-2
to deep-link the user
into a specific piece


78
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,392 line:-1
of app clip functionality,


79
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,262 line:-2
similar to how you can
deep-link into apps today.


80
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:27,734 line:-2
So now that you're a bit more familiar
with how an app clip is invoked,


81
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,405 line:-2
let's talk about how to deliver
and beta test your app clip.


82
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,577 line:-2
So, after you finish developing
your app clip in Xcode,


83
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,744 line:-1
you'll generate a build.


84
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:41,882 line:-2
This build contains both your app
and your app clip together.


85
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:46,587 line:-2
An app clip cannot be packaged
separately from your full app.


86
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,791 line:-2
The build is then delivered
into App Store Connect.


87
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,726 line:-1
You can find the build


88
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,262 line:-2
in the TestFlight view
of App Store Connect.


89
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,765 line:-2
And you'll know that it's a build
that contains an app clip


90
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,167 line:-1
because it has an extra row


91
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,203 line:-2
containing the same information
you're used to seeing with apps,


92
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,506 line:-1
but specific to the app clip.


93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,409 line:-2
When you click into the build details
for this build,


94
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,846 line:-2
you'll see a new app clip
invocation section on the page.


95
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,850 line:-2
From here, you can configure
up to three invocation URLs


96
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,418 line:-1
for your testers to test.


97
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:23,657 line:-2
To do this, you provide a title,
which appears in the TestFlight app,


98
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,060 line:-1
along with the invocation URL itself.


99
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,665 line:-2
Now, once the app clip invocations
have been configured,


100
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:35,435 line:-2
clicking "Save" will make them
available to testers immediately.


101
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,039 line:-1
Now let's look at what testers will see.


102
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:44,344 line:-2
In the App Detail view,
you'll see a new App Clips section.


103
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,780 line:-2
Here, we see the list
of app clip invocations


104
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,316 line:-1
that we just set up in App Store Connect.


105
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,719 line:-2
Tapping the "Test" button
will launch the app clip


106
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,022 line:-1
associated with the current build


107
00:05:55,088 --> 00:06:00,460 line:-2
and pass the configured invocation URL
into the app clip to support deep-linking.


108
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:07,000 line:-2
Now, one thing to note is that TestFlight
is the only app clip invocation case


109
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:11,839 line:-2
that does not show an app clip card
before launching the app clip itself.


110
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,676 line:-2
If testers encounter
any issues with this app clip,


111
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:19,479 line:-2
TestFlight Feedback will be available
to collect information from testers


112
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,348 line:-1
just like it is for apps.


113
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,019 line:-1
So, once beta testing is complete,


114
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,888 line:-1
it's time to think about the metadata


115
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:31,024 line:-2
that will display to your users
on the app clip card.


116
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:38,298 line:0
The app clip card contains a header image,
a title, a subtitle and a call to action.


117
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,501 line:0
Toward the bottom of the card,


118
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,570 line:0
you'll also see more information
about the full app


119
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,873 line:0
and a link to the app on the App Store.


120
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:50,043 line:0
The app clip card is part
of the overall app clip experience.


121
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,016 line:-2
It's easy to get started with App Clips
by setting up a default set


122
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,319 line:-2
of app clip card metadata
in App Store Connect.


123
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:04,291 line:-2
In fact, the default metadata
is required for all app clips.


124
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,595 line:-2
And of all the invocation methods
that I spoke about earlier,


125
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,597 line:-1
this metadata will only appear


126
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:14,468 line:-2
when an app clip is invoked from Safari
or from Messages.


127
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,005 line:-2
And for many of you,
this is all you'll need to set up


128
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,841 line:-2
before releasing
your app clip to the world.


129
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,812 line:-2
To configure your default experience
in App Store Connect,


130
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,682 line:-1
you'll start on the iOS version page.


131
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:32,186 line:-2
Here you'll enter
the default experience metadata,


132
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:37,057 line:-2
including the header image, subtitle,
and you'll choose a call-to-action verb.


133
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,929 line:0
When your app clip is invoked
from Safari or from Messages,


134
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,831 line:0
you'll see this metadata appear
on the app clip card.


135
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,501 line:-2
Now, you might be wondering
how Safari knows


136
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:50,137 line:-2
that a web page
is associated with your app clip


137
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:53,674 line:-2
in order to invoke
your default app clip experience.


138
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:58,212 line:-2
Well, to make this association,
you simply include a meta tag


139
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:02,749 line:-2
on the web page itself
with the name "apple-itunes-app".


140
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:06,987 line:-2
This is the same tag that's used
for Safari Smart App Banners today,


141
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:10,090 line:-2
but with an extra attribute
for the app clip.


142
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,327 line:-1
The app-clip-bundle-id attribute


143
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,730 line:-2
identifies which app clip
to associate with this web page.


144
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:23,403 line:-2
And for your customers who are on iOS 13
and earlier, who can't run app clips,


145
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,739 line:-1
you can add an app-id attribute


146
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:28,475 line:-2
that'll link them to your full app
on the App Store.


147
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,613 line:-2
And that's how you set up
a default app clip experience.


148
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:38,118 line:-2
Some of you may want more control
over your app clip experiences.


149
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:43,457 line:-2
For example, you may wanna set up
customized app clip card metadata


150
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,293 line:-1
for specific invocation URLs.


151
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,297 line:-2
You can do this by creating
advanced app clip experiences.


152
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,035 line:-2
Not only can you customize
app clip card metadata


153
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,870 line:-1
with advanced experiences,


154
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,206 line:-2
but you can also associate
these experiences


155
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,241 line:-1
with places on Apple Maps.


156
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,913 line:-1
Finally, advanced app clip experiences


157
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:09,516 line:-2
support all of the invocation methods
I told you about earlier.


158
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,087 line:0
So now let's look at a few examples
of advanced app clip experiences


159
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,589 line:0
for Forest Explorer.


160
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:20,561 line:0
First is the ability to invoke
a campsite reservation experience


161
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,695 line:0
from Apple Maps.


162
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,532 line:0
When a user taps the button
on the Apple Maps place card


163
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,600 line:0
for this campground,


164
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:30,003 line:0
the app clip card
for this experience will appear.


165
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,808 line:0
We want this app clip card
to display a photo of the campground,


166
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,778 line:0
as well as a meaningful title
and subtitle.


167
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,681 line:0
In this case,
we set the title to "Reserve"


168
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,850 line:0
and the subtitle to the name
of the campground.


169
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,322 line:-2
Next, let's take a look
at the campsite check-in experience.


170
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,558 line:0
Campers will be able to check in
to our high-tech campgrounds


171
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:56,697 line:0
by scanning on-site NFC tags
encoded with our campsite check-in URL.


172
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,801 line:0
Just like the reservation case,
we want this experience


173
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:04,137 line:0
to display the campground photo and name,


174
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,474 line:0
but this time we want
the title to say "Check-in."


175
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,411 line:0
Now, looking at the invocation URL,


176
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:15,349 line:0
you'll notice that this URL
is specific to each campsite,


177
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:19,486 line:0
but we want a single set of metadata
to appear for all campsites.


178
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,223 line:0
If we register metadata
for the URL as you see it,


179
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,393 line:-2
we would need to register
the same metadata for every single site,


180
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,896 line:-2
and this would get repetitive
very quickly.


181
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,400 line:0
So, instead, we'll only associate
the campground metadata


182
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,503 line:0
to the first part of the invocation URL.


183
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,807 line:0
Any URL beginning with this prefix
will display the same metadata.


184
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,778 line:0
And now we've configured metadata
for all of the campsites


185
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,380 line:0
with a single registration.


186
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:51,652 line:-2
These are just a few ways to configure
advanced app clip experiences.


187
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:55,455 line:-2
Now I'd like to show you
how to set up advanced experiences


188
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,590 line:-1
in App Store Connect.


189
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,094 line:-2
First we'll head back
to the iOS version page.


190
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,165 line:-2
Next, we'll click on
the "Get Started" link


191
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,935 line:-2
in the Advanced
App Clip Experiences section.


192
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,772 line:-2
And then we land on this page
where you'll get some background


193
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,475 line:-2
on what you'll be asked to provide
for the experience you're registering.


194
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,380 line:-2
First, you'll need to specify
the app clip invocation URL


195
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,015 line:-1
for your app clip experience.


196
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,651 line:-2
In this case,
I'm gonna register the full URL


197
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,987 line:-1
for the campground reservation experience.


198
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:31,391 line:-2
Below the URL is the bundle ID
of the app clip itself.


199
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,329 line:-1
After setting up your URL,


200
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,131 line:-2
it's time to enter the metadata
for the app clip card.


201
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,269 line:-2
First, we upload metadata
that includes the header,


202
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:45,839 line:-2
image title and subtitle
for this app clip card.


203
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:49,877 line:0
And after entering the metadata,
we answer the question


204
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,914 line:0
of whether to associate this experience
with a place in Apple Maps.


205
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,651 line:0
The campground is represented
as a place on Apple Maps,


206
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,220 line:0
so we select "Yes"
for the place selection.


207
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:05,492 line:0
Then, we select a Maps action
that best fits the experience


208
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,161 line:0
by selecting "Open Reserve Room."


209
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,531 line:-2
To complete setting up
the place association,


210
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:14,268 line:-2
we select the campground
that we're creating the experience for.


211
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,336 line:-1
In this case, Lakeside Campground.


212
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,174 line:-2
And once we've chosen a place,
we're asked a few questions


213
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,677 line:-2
about the relationship
between the app developer and the place.


214
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,814 line:-2
Since Forest Explorer
does not own the campground,


215
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,450 line:-2
but does have a relationship
with the campground,


216
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,820 line:-2
we select "Authorized by Owner"
for the relationship.


217
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:38,258 line:-2
And then, in response to
"What is promoted in this experience?"


218
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,894 line:-2
we choose
"A different business or service"


219
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,298 line:-2
since we're promoting the campground
and not Forest Explorer.


220
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,401 line:-2
Generally, the answer to
"What is promoted?"


221
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,103 line:-1
will fall into one of two main categories:


222
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,240 line:-1
"Your business" and "Other businesses".


223
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,477 line:-2
Most of you will set up experiences
promoting your own business


224
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,180 line:-2
because your app clip represents
surface offerings


225
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,015 line:-1
that your business provides.


226
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,187 line:-2
But some of you will set up experiences
for other businesses.


227
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,224 line:-2
This makes sense
when you represent other businesses,


228
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,092 line:-1
for example, the way Yelp does.


229
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,728 line:-1
Notice that the icon that displays


230
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,997 line:-2
when the experience represents
another business


231
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,900 line:-1
is a category icon and not the app icon.


232
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:24,304 line:-2
This icon is displayed in History,
the Safari app clip banner,


233
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:27,341 line:-2
and other parts
of the app clip experience.


234
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,445 line:-2
Once you've completed the process
of setting up your experience,


235
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,481 line:-2
you'll see all the experiences
you've configured


236
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:37,885 line:-2
along with their statuses
on the App Clip Experiences page.


237
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,889 line:-2
And that's how you set up
advanced app clip experiences


238
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,290 line:-1
in App Store Connect.


239
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,592 line:-1
Now, once this is done,


240
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,195 line:-2
it's time to think about
domain associations.


241
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,466 line:-1
Every invocation URL contains a domain.


242
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,103 line:-2
Now, we need to make sure
you're authorized to use these domains


243
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,571 line:-1
to invoke your app clips.


244
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,776 line:-2
To do this, first you specify
which domains you wanna associate


245
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:03,844 line:-1
with your app clips


246
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:06,613 line:-2
by using
the Associated Domains Entitlement.


247
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:11,818 line:-2
Next, you set up
Apple App Site Association files


248
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,287 line:-1
to be served from those domains.


249
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,491 line:-2
These need to contain a reference
to the app clip app ID.


250
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,061 line:-1
If everything checks out,


251
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,997 line:-2
then your app clip
can be invoked on-device.


252
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,936 line:-2
If you wanna check
the validation status of your app clip,


253
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,538 line:-2
go to the build details page
in App Store Connect.


254
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,809 line:-2
From here, click the "View Status" link
in the App Clip section


255
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:39,580 line:-2
and this will bring up a modal
showing domain validation status.


256
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,718 line:-2
The cache status column
is what drives app clip invocations


257
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:46,520 line:-1
on your customers' devices.


258
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:52,526 line:-2
And if, for example, you're working
on your Apple App Site Association file


259
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:55,429 line:-2
and you wanna find out
whether your changes are valid,


260
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,332 line:-2
you can click
the "Load Debug Status" link.


261
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:03,737 line:-2
By doing this, we'll reach out
to your servers in real time


262
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:06,673 line:-2
and validate the app clip portions
of your file.


263
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:10,110 line:-2
If there are any issues,
you can get more detail here.


264
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,282 line:0
There's a lot more to learn
about associating domains,


265
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:18,886 line:0
so for a full walk-through of the process,
be sure to check out


266
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,455 line:0
the "What's New
in Universal Links" session.


267
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,825 line:-2
There are also a number
of other informative sessions


268
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:26,960 line:-1
focusing on various aspects of app clips


269
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:30,697 line:-2
that are linked in the resources
associated with this session.


270
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:34,601 line:-2
And that's how you set up App Clips
in App Store Connect.


271
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,872 line:-2
Next, I'd like to show you
how to use App Store Connect


272
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:43,377 line:-2
to take advantage of the new features
in Game Center on iOS 14.


273
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,114 line:-1
First, we have Challenges.


274
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:50,217 line:-2
Now, Challenges enable players
to challenge other players


275
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,787 line:-2
to complete an achievement
or to beat a leaderboard score.


276
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,357 line:-1
To enable this feature for your game,


277
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,327 line:-2
go to the Game Center landing page,
under Features.


278
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:02,829 line:-1
From there,


279
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:05,866 line:-2
you click the "Allow challenges
in this game" checkbox.


280
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:10,404 line:-2
Once you save this change, your players
will be able to challenge each other.


281
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,474 line:-1
Next, we have Recurring Leaderboards.


282
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,945 line:-2
Recurring Leaderboards
are a new kind of leaderboard


283
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:22,082 line:-2
that allow you to collect scores
for a predetermined period of time,


284
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:26,887 line:-2
and that period is then scheduled
to repeat at specific intervals.


285
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:32,092 line:-2
As an example, let's say you create
a recurring leaderboard


286
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,196 line:-2
that begins for the first time
on October 13th at 6:00 p.m.


287
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:39,533 line:-2
It lasts for four hours
and repeats every week.


288
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,338 line:-2
This means that scores
are posted to this leaderboard


289
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,207 line:-1
beginning on Tuesday the 13th at 6:00 p.m.


290
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:50,611 line:-2
and the leaderboard
continues to collect scores


291
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,679 line:-1
for four hours until 10:00 p.m.


292
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:57,518 line:-2
And every week after the 13th,
from 6:00 to 10:00 p.m.


293
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:01,088 line:-2
a fresh leaderboard opens up again
to take new scores.


294
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:05,192 line:-2
This is the page where you set up
Recurring Leaderboards


295
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:06,326 line:-1
in App Store Connect.


296
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,795 line:-1
If you've set up leaderboards in the past,


297
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,031 line:-2
most of these fields
will look familiar to you.


298
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:14,434 line:-2
For Recurring Leaderboards,
we've just added a start time,


299
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:18,638 line:-2
a duration and a field where you can
specify the recurrence rules.


300
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,476 line:0
We have two additional sessions


301
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,444 line:0
that cover the full breadth
of new Game Center features,


302
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,247 line:0
so be sure to check those out.


303
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:34,755 line:-2
Next, I wanna give you an exciting update
about our subscriptions program.


304
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:38,725 line:-2
Subscriptions are
one of the fastest growing business models


305
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:39,993 line:-1
on the App Store...


306
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,331 line:-2
and we know that customers love
our Family Sharing capabilities,


307
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:49,369 line:-2
which let them share Apple services
like Music, Apple Arcade and TV+.


308
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,340 line:-2
Which is why we're so excited
to announce that starting this fall,


309
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:59,012 line:-2
Family Sharing for subscriptions
will be available to all app developers.


310
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,149 line:-1
For the first time, everyone in the family


311
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:04,952 line:-2
can have access
to great subscriptions from the App Store


312
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:06,186 line:-1
with a single purchase.


313
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:11,792 line:-2
Family Sharing will be available
for both auto-renewable subscriptions,


314
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,562 line:-2
as well as non-consumable
in-app purchases.


315
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:21,034 line:-2
Family Sharing is flexible enough
to adapt to your different business needs.


316
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,238 line:-2
For example, if you would like to make
a family-shared subscription


317
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:28,242 line:-2
an upgrade from an individual one,
you can do just that.


318
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,645 line:-2
When you enable Family Sharing
for your subscription


319
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:33,614 line:-1
or non-consumable in-app purchase,


320
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:38,519 line:-2
all new customers will automatically
share the purchase with their family.


321
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,555 line:-2
Be sure to update
your in-app purchase metadata


322
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:45,225 line:-2
to appropriately communicate
that it is a shared purchase.


323
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,863 line:-2
On the other hand,
if you have existing subscribers,


324
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,066 line:-2
those subscribers will need
to take an action to opt in


325
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,736 line:-2
to sharing the subscription
with their families.


326
00:18:57,938 --> 00:19:00,541 line:-2
To configure Family Sharing
in App Store Connect,


327
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,210 line:-2
navigate to the In-App Purchase
detail page.


328
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,212 line:-1
Once you arrive here,


329
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,415 line:-2
you'll wanna think about your metadata
to make sure you're communicating


330
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,584 line:-2
that this is a family-shared
in-app purchase.


331
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,321 line:-2
When you're ready to enable
Family Sharing,


332
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:17,191 line:-2
click the "Turn On" link
toward the middle of the page.


333
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,562 line:-2
When you do this, we will ask you
to confirm your decision.


334
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:23,931 line:-1
Please consider your decision carefully,


335
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:28,068 line:-2
because once you enable Family Sharing
for a live in-app purchase,


336
00:19:28,135 --> 00:19:29,903 line:-1
you cannot turn it off again.


337
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:35,042 line:-2
Once you confirm, Family Sharing
will go into effect immediately.


338
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,980 line:-2
For more information about how to support
Family Sharing with StoreKit,


339
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,850 line:-1
along with other updates to StoreKit APIs,


340
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,019 line:-2
watch the "What's new
with In-App Purchases" session.


341
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:50,357 line:-2
We've also added an exciting set
of testing features


342
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:52,659 line:-2
that includes local testing
of in-app purchases


343
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,595 line:-1
directly from within Xcode,


344
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,599 line:-2
and we've made enhancements
to the Sandbox testing experience.


345
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:02,936 line:-2
We'll take a deep dive into these features
in "Testing In-App Purchases."


346
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,374 line:-2
And finally, if you wanna make
the most of subscription features


347
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:11,211 line:-2
for your business, you'll wanna watch
"Architecting for Subscriptions."


348
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:18,952 line:-2
And finally, we'd like to tell you
about our expanded App Store Connect API.


349
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,856 line:-2
Two years ago,
we launched the App Store Connect API


350
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:25,225 line:-2
with support for TestFlight,
user management,


351
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,994 line:-1
provisioning and reporting.


352
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,163 line:-2
Later this year,
we're exciting to be adding


353
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,533 line:-1
two powerful new sets of APIs.


354
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:37,137 line:-2
We'll be introducing a suite
of App Metadata APIs


355
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:40,407 line:-2
that will let you manage
your presence on the App Store,


356
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:43,644 line:-1
as well as a new Power and Performance API


357
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,046 line:-2
that'll let you download
the same aggregate data


358
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:50,484 line:-2
that drives the new power
and performance analysis tools in Xcode.


359
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,056 line:-2
In fact, just between these two new
categories of API functionality,


360
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:59,193 line:-1
we're adding over 200 new endpoints.


361
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:02,196 line:-1
For App Metadata,


362
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,666 line:-2
you'll be able to do things,
like create new App Store versions,


363
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,668 line:-1
set pricing and availability,


364
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,704 line:-1
edit app- and version-level metadata,


365
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,373 line:-2
associate builds
to your App Store versions


366
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,009 line:-1
and submit those versions for review.


367
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:20,480 line:-2
Now, we can't even begin
to scratch the surface


368
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,683 line:-1
of the new APIs in this session,


369
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:26,019 line:-2
so be sure to check out
the new "App Store Connect API" session


370
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:28,856 line:0
for a deep dive into the new APIs


371
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:31,391 line:0
and walk-throughs of some common use cases


372
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,626 line:0
that you may encounter.


373
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:35,395 line:-1
So, we've covered a lot of ground today.


374
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:39,199 line:-2
We talked about using App Store Connect
to configure App Clips,


375
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:40,601 line:-1
and new Game Center features,


376
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,003 line:-2
like Challenges
and Recurring Leaderboards.


377
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,808 line:-2
You'll soon be able to make
your subscriptions family-shareable,


378
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,143 line:-2
and we're adding
a ton of new functionality


379
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,945 line:-1
to the App Store Connect API.


380
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,015 line:-2
We're very excited
about all of these new features


381
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:57,718 line:-2
and we can't wait to see
what you'll do with them.


382
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,854 line:-1
Thank you for watching this session,


383
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:03,290 line:-2
and please enjoy
the rest of your conference.


384
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:05,425 line:-1
