1
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:06.773
Hello, and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:10.477
Hi, everyone.
Thank you for tuning in.


3
00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.582
My name is David Lui,
and I'm excited to present to you


4
00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.786
how to bring AR Quick Look
to commerce and retail workflows.


5
00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:25.993
Starting in iOS 12,


6
00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:31.798
we introduced AR Quick Look, our built-in
system-wide AR viewer for 3D content


7
00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.800
where you can preview USDZ


8
00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.337
and Reality File scenes
right with you in your world,


9
00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.840
all without needing to download an app.


10
00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:43.043
With iOS 13, we added new features


11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.912
like launching straight into AR


12
00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:49.483
the moment you tap the 3D model
from any application or website.


13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.587
You can now share product links
instead of the 3D model


14
00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:57.758
to bring users back
to detailed product pages from retailers.


15
00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.528
We added support
for detecting vertical planes


16
00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.463
along with horizontal planes


17
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.067
making it possible
to anchor picture frames or lights


18
00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:09.770
on floors and walls in your space.


19
00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:13.640
There's even support
for viewing face accessories,


20
00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.709
like glasses and masks,


21
00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:19.446
using the front camera
coupled with our automatic face occlusion


22
00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:22.015
for that realistic try-on experience.


23
00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:25.419
We gave a session last year


24
00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:28.689
where you can learn more about
our other features and advancements


25
00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.357
in AR Quick Look.


26
00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:32.192
In the last year,


27
00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.863
AR Quick Look was accompanied by
two new products in the AR family...


28
00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:40.067
Reality Composer and Reality Converter,


29
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.269
and serves as a great visualization tool


30
00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:45.138
for viewing and sharing
your 3D compositions.


31
00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:50.944
And in support of those applications
and frameworks, like ARKit and RealityKit,


32
00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:52.079
we've added new features


33
00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.948
like instant AR placement
and object occlusion


34
00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:58.218
that make the AR experience
more responsive and realistic,


35
00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:01.688
especially on the new iPad Pro
with LiDAR scanner.


36
00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:06.493
Now objects appear immediately
in your world


37
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.797
and can be anchored anywhere
from the flat surfaces of your floor


38
00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:13.400
to the curved surface of your couch.


39
00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.836
And together with object occlusion,


40
00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:18.272
AR furniture could be placed in your space


41
00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:21.508
between and behind
pieces of real furniture


42
00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:24.678
for more realistic product visualization.


43
00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:27.881
But one of the amazing things
we previewed last year


44
00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:29.750
was our retail integration,


45
00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.251
and we started with Apple Pay.


46
00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:34.588
Our goal is to provide
a tighter integration


47
00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:37.758
of AR technology and commerce
with retailers


48
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.394
in a really simple and easy way,


49
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.697
and AR Quick Look was a fantastic solution


50
00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:48.402
to enable not only a richer and more
immersive experience for consumers,


51
00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:52.639
but also for businesses
to sell their products in AR.


52
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.879
We've seen a lot of great companies
like Home Depot, 1800Flowers, and Wayfair


53
00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.982
adopt this technology and integrate
AR Quick Look


54
00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.319
as part of their shopping experience
with great feedback,


55
00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.888
resulting in increased purchases.


56
00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:11.391
And one of the most notable is
Bang & Olufsen,


57
00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:15.929
where Jakob Kristoffersen, Senior Manager
of Customer Experience said,


58
00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:21.134
"Users who engage with the AR experience
in our iOS app or on the website


59
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:26.173
are four times more likely to seek out
our Store Finder to visit a B&O store


60
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.209
and has aided our sales effort
to great extents."


61
00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:32.779
So let's take a look at how this works.


62
00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:36.216
We've added a banner at the bottom
of the AR Quick Look view


63
00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:38.819
which provides a quick one-tap way


64
00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:42.656
for the customer to immediately purchase
the item, like this alarm clock,


65
00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:45.959
after seeing the product
in the world with AR.


66
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.364
The Apple Pay banner has
a very clean and templated layout


67
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.933
where the product information
is located on the left


68
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.135
and the Apple Pay button is on the right.


69
00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:59.840
In addition to the Apple Pay banner,
there is a custom action banner


70
00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:03.177
where retailers can provide
their own call to action text.


71
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.748
Our third banner style
is entirely customizable,


72
00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:12.586
so you can completely configure the look
and feel of the banner using custom HTML.


73
00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:16.456
These three banner styles
are available through the web


74
00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:21.862
starting with iOS 13.3
on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.


75
00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:26.466
Let's take a look how this experience
works from end-to-end


76
00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.236
and discuss what's needed
to create the banner.


77
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.974
Suppose I run an online store
selling retro alarm clocks


78
00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:37.411
and I want to add the Apple Pay button
to my AR experience


79
00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:40.214
when customers visit each product page.


80
00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.718
On my web page,
I can add a link to my USDZ model


81
00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:48.388
so that customers can preview
the alarm clock on their nightstand


82
00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.890
using AR Quick Look.


83
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:55.128
Last year, we introduced a way
to customize the AR Quick Look experience


84
00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:57.731
through the web URL's fragment identifier.


85
00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:01.435
We can use the same system
to provide the required information


86
00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:05.539
for AR Quick Look to use to display
an Apple Pay banner.


87
00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:09.409
These customization options
get passed to AR Quick Look


88
00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.245
when the user taps on the link.


89
00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.548
AR Quick Look then parses
the fragment identifier


90
00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:16.683
and creates the appropriate banner style.


91
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:21.688
The last step for me
is to add an EventListener to my page.


92
00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.591
This way,
when the customer is ready to take action,


93
00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.361
tapping on the banner
will dismiss AR Quick Look,


94
00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:29.863
and notify the EventListener
on my website,


95
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.266
which can then present
the Apple Pay prompt.


96
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.804
Now, let's go into more detail
about how to specify these customizations.


97
00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:41.508
Before we jump in,
I'd like to first give you a refresher


98
00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:44.878
on how to integrate AR Quick Look
with your website.


99
00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:48.682
On my product page I've added an "a" tag


100
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:52.019
with a link to the USDZ model
of my retro alarm clock.


101
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.423
I've also nested an image tag
to show a thumbnail of the clock.


102
00:05:57.824 --> 00:06:02.663
Adding the rel="ar" attribute tells Safari
that this is an AR experience


103
00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.934
so it will draw an AR badge
and will present AR Quick Look directly,


104
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.503
instead of first navigating
to another page.


105
00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:15.108
Next, we customize the experience
by passing in customization options


106
00:06:15.175 --> 00:06:17.444
through the web URL's fragment identifier,


107
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:19.446
which appears after the hash mark.


108
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.548
To help with code readability,


109
00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:24.218
I've separated each parameter
on its own line,


110
00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:26.854
but in practice they should be separated


111
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.524
only by an ampersand
without any spaces in between.


112
00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:34.261
Normally, tapping on the share button


113
00:06:34.328 --> 00:06:37.865
allows the user to share
the current page that they are on.


114
00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.902
However, specifying
the canonicalWebPageURL


115
00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:43.937
overrides the default URL.


116
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:45.639
In my example,


117
00:06:45.706 --> 00:06:49.309
users can share a direct link
to this fictitious product page,


118
00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:51.445
even though they were
originally viewing it


119
00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:53.614
on the Quick Look gallery page.


120
00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:57.551
We also support disabling content scaling


121
00:06:57.618 --> 00:06:59.753
through
the allowsContentScaling parameter,


122
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.223
so people can preview content
at the intended size.


123
00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:05.092
In my example,


124
00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:09.429
I always want the alarm clock viewed
at its true real-world size,


125
00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:13.100
so I've provided a value of zero
to allowsContentScaling


126
00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.402
which disables scaling.


127
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.207
So that's a quick recap on integrating
AR Quick Look on your website


128
00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:24.144
and how to use the fragment identifier
to customize AR Quick Look.


129
00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:29.449
Now let's talk in more detail about each
of the three available banner styles...


130
00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.353
starting with Apple Pay.


131
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:37.791
If you're already accepting Apple Pay
as part of your business payment methods,


132
00:07:37.858 --> 00:07:42.296
the Apple Pay banner is the simplest
and most convenient way to get set up


133
00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:46.366
and allow customers to make purchases
right within the AR experience


134
00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:51.238
with all the benefits of Apple Pay,
like being a fast and secure way to pay.


135
00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:55.108
If this is your first time
incorporating Apple Pay on your website,


136
00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:59.646
there's a lot of great resources online
including guidelines to help get set up.


137
00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:04.318
As a reminder, AR Quick Look
is a system extension


138
00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:06.820
and was built with security in mind.


139
00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:09.990
So no payment information
is collected or stored


140
00:08:10.057 --> 00:08:13.560
since the payment happens
after the AR experience dismisses


141
00:08:13.627 --> 00:08:16.530
and the customer is returned back
to the retail web page.


142
00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:20.767
Retailers have a wide selection
of button types to choose from


143
00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.436
to best match with their business.


144
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.239
Specifically seven types.


145
00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:29.877
The first four button types,
like Pay with or Check out with Apple Pay,


146
00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:32.246
are focused on purchasing a product...


147
00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:37.918
while the last three payment styles,
book, donate and subscribe are tailored


148
00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:42.756
for specific use cases, such as travel
or subscription-based businesses.


149
00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.627
Underneath each button type
is their corresponding value


150
00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.062
for the Apple-Pay-Button-Type
parameter option,


151
00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:50.564
which we'll talk about shortly.


152
00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:56.069
Here's the code sample which will present
AR Quick Look with the Apple Pay button.


153
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.239
The first thing you might notice
is there's an additional


154
00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:01.241
id="ar-link" attribute.


155
00:09:01.842 --> 00:09:05.012
This specifies the unique identifier
for this link element


156
00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:08.215
which we will use later
when we start listening for tap events.


157
00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:11.885
There are four required parameters:


158
00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:16.690
applePayButtonType, checkoutTitle,
checkoutSubtitle and price.


159
00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:20.961
In our example,
I've chosen the plain Apple Pay style,


160
00:09:21.028 --> 00:09:22.896
which is simple and compact.


161
00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:27.668
The title and subtitle is where you can
supply the product information


162
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:28.735
to the customer.


163
00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:34.141
Because URLs can't contain spaces,
the values in the fragment identifier


164
00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:38.178
need to be percent-encoded such as
the spaces in the title and subtitle.


165
00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:41.949
If your website supports
multiple languages,


166
00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:45.586
you'll need to localize the string values
provided to the parameters


167
00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:47.855
since AR Quick Look
will display them as is.


168
00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:50.991
This is especially important
for the price parameter


169
00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:53.894
when representing currency
for different locales.


170
00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:56.763
And of course, you can also combine this


171
00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.299
with other AR Quick Look
customization options


172
00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:00.767
like allowsContentScaling.


173
00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:04.972
Let me show you what the full Apple Pay
experience looks like.


174
00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:08.709
Say I'm shopping
and I find an alarm clock that I like.


175
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.647
I can place it on my nightstand
and see it up close, right in my room.


176
00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:17.084
Oh, this looks great.


177
00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:21.688
I'll rotate and position it
to my preferred spot close to my bed.


178
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.492
Okay, I'm definitely going to
purchase this.


179
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:28.829
Since the banner's always visible
on-screen with the Apple Pay button,


180
00:10:28.896 --> 00:10:31.765
I can immediately tap "buy" to start
the transaction.


181
00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:35.035
AR Quick Look will then dismiss


182
00:10:35.102 --> 00:10:38.772
and return to the web page
with the Apple Pay prompt brought up,


183
00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:41.842
where I can then authenticate
and complete my purchase.


184
00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:42.910
[app beeps]


185
00:10:44.178 --> 00:10:46.413
Now let's look at the second style--


186
00:10:48.048 --> 00:10:49.349
the custom action banner.


187
00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:54.354
The custom action banner provides the same
intuitive layout of the Apply Pay banner


188
00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:57.257
but provides the ability for supplying
your own call to actions


189
00:10:57.324 --> 00:11:01.862
like "Add To Cart" or "Preorder"
to help move the customer one step further


190
00:11:01.929 --> 00:11:02.963
in the purchasing flow.


191
00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:08.202
This conveys the intention by the user
to proceed to follow-up questions


192
00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:13.006
such as asking for an e-mail address to be
notified when the kids slide is released.


193
00:11:14.408 --> 00:11:16.176
After AR Quick Look dismisses,


194
00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:18.478
your website can then perform custom logic


195
00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:20.914
such as adding to the item
to the shopping cart,


196
00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:22.616
prompting for the product size,


197
00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:24.618
or even opening Apple Maps
to help the customer


198
00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:26.687
find the closest store near them.


199
00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:30.524
The call to action
provides more flexibility


200
00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:33.827
to enable additional retail use cases
besides purchasing,


201
00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:36.563
providing more ways to integrate with AR.


202
00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:42.603
The code is very similar to Apple Pay
except we need to specify callToAction


203
00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:45.038
instead of the
Apple-Pay-Button-Type parameter.


204
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:49.643
Again, be sure to percent-encode
the URL parameter values


205
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.014
in the fragment identifier and localize
the strings for different locales


206
00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:57.351
for both the call to action text
and price fields.


207
00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:03.757
In addition, the price parameter is now
optional for the custom action in iOS 14.


208
00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:07.194
This provides better flexibility
for products


209
00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:10.831
which might have varying prices
depending on the product variant.


210
00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:16.436
However, keep in mind that this field is
still required on previous versions of iOS


211
00:12:16.503 --> 00:12:18.672
and should not be empty.


212
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.477
Let's take a look at a kids slide
from the AR Quick Look gallery page.


213
00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:27.347
I'll go into object mode, where you can
see the custom action banner


214
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:30.017
is always visible for quick access.


215
00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:33.887
Tapping on the custom action button
will dismiss AR Quick Look


216
00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:35.889
and take me to the documentation page,


217
00:12:35.956 --> 00:12:39.326
which is how I've defined and set up
the custom action.


218
00:12:41.562 --> 00:12:45.365
Now let's look at the last style,
the custom banner.


219
00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.569
This banner is the most customizable,


220
00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:54.274
where you can supply your own custom
HTML file to fit your own unique use case.


221
00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:57.544
This allows you to customize
the entire view


222
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:00.581
so you can use your own font,
layout and graphic


223
00:13:00.647 --> 00:13:03.150
to match your business' branding
and style.


224
00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:08.622
This banner supports three predefined
heights which can be used to communicate


225
00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:11.992
additional information and contain
personalized messaging.


226
00:13:14.027 --> 00:13:18.131
Like the custom action, it is up to you
to decide how to respond.


227
00:13:18.198 --> 00:13:21.235
For example, you can start
a Business Chat conversation


228
00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:24.238
by redirecting to your unique
Business Chat URL.


229
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.976
To comply with AR Quick Look's
security standards,


230
00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:32.679
the HTML resource must be sent over HTTPS.


231
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.084
Otherwise, the banner will not display
and the request will be ignored.


232
00:13:38.886 --> 00:13:40.888
To display the custom HTML banner,


233
00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:43.957
you'll need to set just one parameter,
"custom,"


234
00:13:44.024 --> 00:13:47.194
and provide the absolute URL
to the HTML file.


235
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:51.431
Like the other two banners, make sure
to percent-encode this value


236
00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.867
before appending it as a URL parameter.


237
00:13:55.536 --> 00:13:58.205
There's an optional "customHeight"
parameter available


238
00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:00.207
if you want to set the banner height.


239
00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:04.044
Supply a value of 'small' to set
the banner height to 81 points.


240
00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:07.447
Or 'medium' to set the banner height
to 121 points.


241
00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:11.451
And 'large' to set the banner height
to 161 points.


242
00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:14.888
If you omit the custom height
URL parameter,


243
00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:17.424
AR Quick Look uses a default small height.


244
00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:23.397
Here's a great example of shopping
for a guitar from our fictitious store,


245
00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:24.865
called Acoustic House.


246
00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:29.837
I'll go ahead and tap on this guitar image
which will push me into AR Quick Look


247
00:14:29.903 --> 00:14:32.673
where I can preview
the Stratocaster guitar in my room.


248
00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:37.077
You can see Acoustic House is using
the custom banner style


249
00:14:37.144 --> 00:14:40.414
and has presented the banner
for a conversational experience


250
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.115
with the immersion in AR.


251
00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:46.119
On tap, AR Quick Look launches
a Business Chat conversation


252
00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:47.354
in Messages,


253
00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:50.457
where I can chat with a live agent
and ask questions


254
00:14:50.524 --> 00:14:52.192
and eventually place an order.


255
00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:56.230
This illustrates how AR Quick Look
provides a really powerful handoff


256
00:14:56.296 --> 00:14:59.466
from the AR experience to applications
like Business Chat,


257
00:14:59.533 --> 00:15:03.570
allowing customers to connect directly
with companies to learn more


258
00:15:03.637 --> 00:15:05.138
and quickly get answers.


259
00:15:06.607 --> 00:15:08.342
If you're not already familiar,


260
00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:11.144
Business Chat allows consumers
to connect with brands


261
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:14.715
to ask questions,
schedule appointments and deliveries,


262
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.018
purchase goods and services
using Apple Pay and more


263
00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:19.653
right from the Messages App.


264
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:24.625
Here, in this example, The Home Depot
is using AR Quick Look


265
00:15:24.691 --> 00:15:27.160
to help consumers check out
home appliances


266
00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:31.031
in an immersive and engaging way
as part of their buying process.


267
00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:33.734
And with our new banner feature,


268
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.869
AR Quick Look
can then launch Business Chat


269
00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:40.040
where consumers can start a conversation
with businesses like Home Depot


270
00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:41.542
about the washer machine


271
00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:44.578
and receive a USDZ file
of the companion dryer


272
00:15:44.645 --> 00:15:47.915
where they can place it virtually
in their laundry room with AR.


273
00:15:49.183 --> 00:15:52.286
This is a great way for customers
to learn more about a product


274
00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:56.490
and really make an informed buying
decision in a private and secure channel.


275
00:15:57.024 --> 00:15:59.293
And for businesses,
it is really easy to provide


276
00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:01.361
this seamless customer experience


277
00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:06.166
by using a Business Chat URL
as a custom action or custom banner event.


278
00:16:08.368 --> 00:16:11.605
Here's a summary of the different
customization parameters


279
00:16:11.672 --> 00:16:13.841
for each of the different banner styles.


280
00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:19.079
As a reminder, the highlighted parameters
are optional for that banner style.


281
00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:25.152
Now that we've gone over how to customize
AR Quick Look to show a banner,


282
00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:27.988
let's go over how your website
can get notified


283
00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.823
when users interact with the banner.


284
00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:35.362
From earlier, we saw the code snippets
of how to use the fragment identifier


285
00:16:35.429 --> 00:16:37.598
to specify which type of banner to show.


286
00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:41.602
To listen for and be notified
of tap events,


287
00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:43.804
we need to add an EventListener like this.


288
00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:47.374
Remember the id="ar-link" earlier?


289
00:16:48.242 --> 00:16:51.879
This is how the script is able
to retrieve the corresponding "a" tag


290
00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:53.347
that we defined previously


291
00:16:53.413 --> 00:16:55.482
and assign it
to the constant linkElement.


292
00:16:56.884 --> 00:17:00.120
When WebKit invokes your listener,
check the data property.


293
00:17:00.187 --> 00:17:03.290
A value of
"apple_ar_quicklook_button_tapped"


294
00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:06.460
confirms the user tapped the banner
in AR Quick Look.


295
00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:11.164
From here,
you can either invoke the Apple Pay sheet,


296
00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:15.035
or perform some custom logic
like adding the item to the shopping cart


297
00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:17.204
depending on the banner style displayed.


298
00:17:18.906 --> 00:17:22.309
The AR Quick Look gallery
has been updated with new 3D models


299
00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:24.978
and the banner examples
we've gone through together.


300
00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:29.283
Visit the gallery page on your iOS devices
and try everything out.


301
00:17:32.586 --> 00:17:35.789
It's really amazing to see how people
are taking advantage of AR


302
00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:38.659
and integrating AR Quick Look
into their website


303
00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:40.727
and iOS application workflows.


304
00:17:40.794 --> 00:17:43.730
We love seeing all the many types
of content


305
00:17:43.797 --> 00:17:47.000
people are sharing and experiencing
in AR Quick Look.


306
00:17:47.634 --> 00:17:49.837
You saw the Apple Pay
and Custom Action banner


307
00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:52.539
which are really simple
and easy templated styles


308
00:17:52.606 --> 00:17:56.343
to quickly add purchasing options
to your AR experience.


309
00:17:57.244 --> 00:18:01.048
With the custom HTML banner,
retailers have even greater flexibility


310
00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:05.219
in customizing the view
to match their branding and colors.


311
00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.724
There's lots of great documentation
available on developer.apple.com,


312
00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:12.993
including how to add an Apple Pay button


313
00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.930
or a custom action in AR Quick Look
that I've went through today.


314
00:18:16.997 --> 00:18:18.465
We love to hear from you,


315
00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:20.968
and you can send us feedback
on your Apple Pay


316
00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:24.671
and custom banner integrations,
along with any requests you may have,


317
00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:26.406
through Feedback Assistant.


318
00:18:26.473 --> 00:18:28.542
Thank you, and thanks for watching.
