1
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:06,540 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,378 line:0
Hello, everyone,
and welcome to "What's New in HealthKit."


3
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,680 line:0
My name is Netra,
and I'm a software developer


4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,115 line:0
on the HealthKit team.


5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:19,353 line:-2
We have some exciting new developments
in HealthKit to share with you,


6
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,889 line:-2
and we can't wait to see
what you do with them.


7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,925 line:-1
The first thing I want to share with you


8
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,427 line:-2
is the ability to track symptoms
in HealthKit.


9
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:32,031 line:-2
Tracking symptoms is an important aspect
of monitoring health data.


10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,002 line:-2
Our users might want to track
a wide range of symptoms.


11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,639 line:-2
This could be shortness of breath,
sleep or appetite changes,


12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,107 line:-1
or simply a running nose.


13
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,577 line:-2
Symptoms offer valuable insights
into your health.


14
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:47,014 line:-2
They can also help you or your doctor
make informed decisions


15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,882 line:-1
about diagnoses or treatment.


16
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:53,287 line:-2
This year, we are proud to introduce
30 symptom data types to HealthKit.


17
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:56,657 line:-2
We have attempted to cover
a wide range of symptoms.


18
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:01,128 line:-2
Developers can now read and write
symptom samples in order to build


19
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,530 line:-1
virtual health experiences in their apps.


20
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:07,734 line:-2
We can't wait to see the amazing apps
you create using these symptom data types.


21
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,338 line:-2
We recently introduced the ECG App
on Apple Watch.


22
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,675 line:-1
An ECG, or electrocardiogram, is a test


23
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,811 line:-2
that records the electrical pulses
that make up a heartbeat.


24
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,113 line:-1
By looking at an ECG,


25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,983 line:-2
a doctor can gain critical insights
about your heart rhythm,


26
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,252 line:-1
and also look for irregularities in it.


27
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:30,524 line:-2
The ECG App on Apple Watch
can recall heartbeat and heart rhythm


28
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,327 line:-2
using the electrical sensors
on the Digital Crown.


29
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,630 line:-2
These waveforms can be viewed
in the Health app,


30
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,466 line:-2
and they can also be exported as PDFs
to a doctor.


31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,338 line:-2
This year, we're putting the power of ECG
in the hands of all you developers.


32
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:49,743 line:-2
In the latest version of iOS and watchOS,
ECG samples will be available for reading.


33
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,548 line:-2
An ECG sample can be read
as an HKElectrocardiogram.


34
00:01:55,682 --> 00:02:00,454 line:-2
An HKElectrocardiogram represents
a waveform as a series of voltage values.


35
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,358 line:-2
Now, this sample has some
important properties associated with it.


36
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,761 line:-1
When you take an ECG on Apple Watch,


37
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,297 line:-2
the recording is checked
for atrial fibrillation.


38
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,867 line:-2
Atrial fibrillation is a form
of irregular rhythm.


39
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,337 line:-2
It signifies that
the upper and lower chambers of your heart


40
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,539 line:-1
are out of rhythm.


41
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,841 line:-1
After a successful recording,


42
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,210 line:-2
Apple Watch will give you the result
of the recording.


43
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,614 line:-2
The result is in the form
of a classification.


44
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,619 line:-2
The classification can be a sinus rhythm,
which means that the heart is beating


45
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:33,854 line:-1
in a uniform pattern.


46
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,356 line:-1
Or it can be atrial fibrillation.


47
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,494 line:-2
Atrial fibrillation implies
an irregular heart rhythm.


48
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,731 line:-2
It is an indication that the user
should probably go see their doctor.


49
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:48,569 line:-2
If Apple Watch is unable
to determine the ECG result,


50
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:52,339 line:-2
either due to a low or a high heart rate,
or due to any other reason,


51
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,408 line:-1
the result is considered inconclusive.


52
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,911 line:-1
There are some more important properties


53
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,447 line:-2
that make up
an HKElectrocardiogram sample.


54
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,183 line:-1
The next one is the symptomsStatus.


55
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:08,021 line:-2
It tells us if the user associated
a symptom with this ECG.


56
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:11,658 line:-2
We already saw the new symptom data types
introduced this year.


57
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,994 line:-1
When a user takes an ECG,


58
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:17,231 line:-2
quite often it's because they have
a symptom they are experiencing.


59
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,067 line:-2
This could be heartburn
or tightness in their chest.


60
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,505 line:-2
The symptom experienced
can be recorded along with the ECG.


61
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:28,108 line:-2
As mentioned earlier,
the HKElectrocardiogram sample


62
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,910 line:-1
is a collection of voltage measurements.


63
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:33,881 line:-2
The sample is backed by more properties
that describe the measurements.


64
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:38,886 line:-2
These include the average heart rate,
the sampling frequency


65

<body>
<center><h1>500 Internal Server Error</h1></center>
<hr><center>QTL_Cache/1.2.14</center>
</body>
</html>
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,658 line:-2
The number of voltage measurements refers
to the individual voltage measurements


66
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,360 line:-1
that make up an ECG sample.


67
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:51,632 line:-2
To retrieve the individual measurements,
you can run the HKElectrocardiogramQuery.


68
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,270 line:-2
You can fetch the ECG samples
via any of the HealthKit queries


69
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,006 line:-2
and then initialize
the HKElectrocardiogramQuery


70
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,307 line:-1
with the fetched sample.


71
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,510 line:-2
When this query is executed
on the health store,


72
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,246 line:-2
you get the individual
voltage measurements backing the ECG


73
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,447 line:-1
in the data handler.


74
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:11,185 line:-2
Electrocardiograms are an important
diagnostic tool for heart health.


75
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,488 line:-2
Another important metric
of the user's health is their mobility.


76
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:18,125 line:-2
These are metrics that gauge
a user's functional exercise capacity,


77
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,160 line:-1
or their ability to do aerobic work.


78
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,565 line:-2
Mobility is strongly tied
to respiratory diseases and heart health.


79
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,802 line:-2
Mobility is especially important
for patients recovering from an injury,


80
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,170 line:-1
or aging individuals.


81
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,674 line:-2
Mobility metrics are usually measured
across a period


82
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,910 line:-2
where the user is walking without stopping
on a flat surface.


83
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,980 line:-2
Your iPhone or Apple Watch
can also record some of this data


84
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,215 line:-1
during bouts of walking.


85
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,018 line:-2
HealthKit is proud to introduce
a new set of mobility types this year.


86
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,655 line:-2
The first is the walking speed
and step length.


87
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,193 line:-2
Walking takes strength, fitness, balance,
and coordination.


88
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:57,631 line:-2
Changes in any of these areas could affect
your walking speed and step length.


89
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,869 line:-2
This may also decline with age, injury,
pain, or illness.


90
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,806 line:-2
Balance and coordination are captured
by the walking asymmetry


91
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,441 line:-1
and double support percentage.


92
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,845 line:-2
The next one is the stair ascent
and descent speed.


93
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,781 line:-2
They are an indication
of your cardiovascular health,


94
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,517 line:-1
balance and coordination.


95
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,257 line:-2
Finally, the six-minute walk test distance
is a frequent clinical test for mobility.


96
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,027 line:-2
The more mobile and fit you are,
the higher this number will be.


97
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:32,432 line:-2
These data types are available for reading
and writing on the latest iOS and watchOS.


98
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,537 line:-2
We have introduced some major features
in HealthKit this year.


99
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:40,140 line:-2
These include symptoms,
the HKElectrocardiogram sample


100
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:44,111 line:-2
and the HKElectrocardiogramQuery,
and the mobility data types.


101
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:48,348 line:-2
We are so excited to see how you
take advantage of all these new types,


102
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,585 line:-2
and we look forward to seeing
all the amazing apps that you create.


103
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,521 line:-1
Go build great health apps, and as always,


104
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,657 line:-2
let us know
if you have any feedback for us.


105
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,460 line:-2
Thank you for watching.
Have a great a WWDC.
