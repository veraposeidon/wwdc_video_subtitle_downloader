00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:07,875 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:12,212 line:0
Hi, I'm Luming,
an engineer from the App Clips team.


4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:16,984 line:0
In this video, I'll discuss creating
app clip experiences for other businesses.


5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,520 line:-1
We'll start by introducing the concept


6
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:23,790 line:-2
of creating advanced app clip experiences
on behalf of other businesses.


7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,060 line:-2
Then we'll walk through
how to get started.


8
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,030 line:-2
After that, I'll show you
how to set up an app clip card


9
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,165 line:-1
for every advanced app clip experience,


10
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:35,402 line:-2
so the brand of every business you power
shines through.


11
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,438 line:-2
Finally, I'll cover
different types of icons,


12
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,074 line:-2
where they appear
and how to customize them.


13
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,276 line:-1
So when should you consider


14
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,812 line:-2
creating an advanced app clip experience
for other businesses?


15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,681 line:-1
Let's look at a few sample apps.


16
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,083 line:-1
If your existing app


17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,320 line:-2
aggregates many businesses
into a customer-facing app


18
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,856 line:-2
and lets users discover them
from a catalog,


19
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:59,493 line:-2
then it's natural to create
app clip experience for all of them.


20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,829 line:-2
This way, the customers
of the businesses you represent


21
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,265 line:-2
can experience rich functionalities
you provide


22
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,367 line:-1
without having to download your app.


23
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,103 line:-1
This sample app, Food Grid,


24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,007 line:-2
has a vast catalog
of popular restaurants across the nation,


25
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,743 line:-2
making it a great candidate
to get started.


26
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,747 line:-2
Without an app clip, most of the discovery
only happens within your app.


27
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,183 line:-1
By creating app clip experiences,


28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,221 line:-2
more users can discover these businesses
through system-wide features


29
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,023 line:-2
such as
location-based app clip suggestions.


30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,759 line:-2
Potential users
no longer have to install your app


31
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,828 line:-1
just to discover nearby restaurants.


32
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,732 line:-2
Many smaller businesses
don't have their own apps.


33
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,337 line:-2
After all, their primary focus
is to deliver great products or services,


34
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,205 line:-1
not to build apps themselves.


35
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,976 line:-2
In these cases,
creating app clip experiences are great


36
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,712 line:-1
because it lets expert developers like you


37
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,649 line:-2
create app-like experiences
on those businesses' behalf.


38
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,552 line:-1
An example of this kind of app is Reward+,


39
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,589 line:-2
which lets customers get reward points
by entering a promotional code


40
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,926 line:-2
they have already obtained
from another business off-line.


41
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:09,663 line:-2
With app clips, you can work
with businesses to create NFC tag,


42
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,032 line:-1
app clip code or print QR code


43
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,870 line:-2
to offer additional value to customers
that they have already obtained off-line.


44
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:20,607 line:-2
Finally, if your business
focuses on building white-labeled apps


45
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:24,444 line:-2
across a particular industry,
and all of these apps are really similar,


46
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,681 line:-2
and you're thinking of consolidating
all of these templated apps


47
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,349 line:-1
into one single app,


48
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:33,387 line:-2
but you're not sure if combining
all of these into one single app


49
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:38,659 line:-2
can quite capture the individuality
and the brand identity of every business,


50
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,828 line:-1
creating app clips are a fantastic option,


51
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:46,099 line:-2
because now, by combining them
and building app clip experiences,


52
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,569 line:-2
each client can still have
its unique brand


53
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,404 line:-1
across the app clip experience,


54
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,041 line:-2
but now, you only need to build
and maintain a single app.


55
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,677 line:-2
Now that we've covered
when to consider creating


56
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:00,280 line:-2
multiple advanced app clip experiences
for other businesses,


57
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,415 line:-1
let's talk about why.


58
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,484 line:-1
You can build app clips


59
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,021 line:-2
with familiar technologies
you already use to build your app,


60
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:12,759 line:-2
so technologies that you already know,
such as SwiftUI, still applies.


61
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,030 line:-2
Since app clips
are considered as a part of your app,


62
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,434 line:-2
most of the code in your app clip
are just code from your app.


63
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,569 line:-1
All you need to do is to re-use them


64
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:25,405 line:-2
and include them in a new build target
for your app clip.


65
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,609 line:0
Your users can discover app clips


66
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,612 line:0
through both digital
and physical invocation methods,


67
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,649 line:0
such as Messages, the Smart App Banner,
location-based Suggestions


68
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,618 line:-1
as well as NFC and QR.


69
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,721 line:-1
Because app clips are launched on demand,


70
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,990 line:-2
there's no need
for users to download your app.


71
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,224 line:-1
They just use them.


72
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,128 line:-2
This provides a frictionless,
fast and focused experience.


73
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,100 line:-2
And finally,
app clips let the brand identity


74
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,536 line:-1
of the business you power shine through.


75
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,905 line:-1
Every business gets its own app clip card


76
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,407 line:-2
with a beautiful
and distinctive header image,


77
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,477 line:-2
as well as custom title and captions
just for them.


78
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,346 line:-2
If you have watched
some of our other talks,


79
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,348 line:-1
like "Configure and Link Your App Clips,"


80
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,583 line:-1
you may realize that there are


81
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,086 line:-2
a few different types of app clip
experiences you can create.


82
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,355 line:-2
There are a lot of similarities
and overlap


83
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,558 line:-2
between creating
multiple app clip experiences


84
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,459 line:-2
for your own business
versus for other businesses.


85
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,697 line:-2
The important distinction
and the greatest benefit


86
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,900 line:-2
of creating app clip experiences
for other businesses


87
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,636 line:-2
is that by building
one single app clip binary


88
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:33,307 line:-2
and creating multiple experiences,
you can represent and promote


89
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:38,078 line:-2
as many distinctive brand identities
and app clip cards as you would like.


90
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,713 line:-1
This is especially suitable


91
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,150 line:-2
if you have a full app
that aggregates multiple businesses.


92
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,420 line:-2
Getting started with creating
advanced app clip experiences


93
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,922 line:-1
for other businesses takes a few steps.


94
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,125 line:-1
First, let's take a high-level overview.


95
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,828 line:-2
Make sure you build an existing app
and make it ready!


96
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:58,165 line:-2
Then build an app clip by selectively
including parts of your app.


97
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:03,604 line:-2
After that, submit your app, along with
your app clip in App Store Connect.


98
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,773 line:-2
And finally, create an app clip experience
for each business


99
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,842 line:-1
you're promoting or representing


100
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,478 line:-2
through the advanced section
in App Store Connect.


101
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,281 line:-2
Let's go over each of these
in more detail,


102
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,750 line:-1
starting with getting your app ready.


103
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:21,622 line:-2
First, make sure your app handles
each business you represent or promote.


104
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,625 line:-2
If you have built
multiple white-labeled template apps,


105
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,726 line:-1
one for each client,


106
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,663 line:-2
it may be a great opportunity
to consolidate them into a single app.


107
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,433 line:-2
Then consider providing
a custom experience


108
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,602 line:-1
to fit each category of business.


109
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,572 line:-2
For example, you should consider
representing restaurants


110
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,175 line:-1
differently than retail stores in your app


111
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,877 line:-2
from both a visual
and functional standpoint.


112
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,546 line:-1
To make sure your full app


113
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:48,782 line:-2
provides the greatest functionality
and usability to your users,


114
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,618 line:-2
provide a way to browse through,
search from


115
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,621 line:-2
or otherwise explore
your catalog of businesses.


116
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,525 line:-2
Finally, you should handle
universal links in your full app.


117
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:03,530 line:-2
Universal links let you deep link users
from a URL into a part of your app,


118
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:07,768 line:-2
and it is a great technology to adopt
even independent of app clips.


119
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:12,406 line:-2
While links are handled slightly different
as NSUserActivities in an app clip,


120
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,709 line:-2
handling universal links well in your app
sets you up for success


121
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,378 line:-2
for a great linking experience
in your app clip.


122
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,447 line:0
To learn more about universal links,


123
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,983 line:0
please refer to
"What's New in Universal Links."


124
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,752 line:-1
After getting your existing app ready,


125
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,422 line:-2
it's time to build an app clip
based on your app.


126
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:33,160 line:-2
To do this, create a new app clip target
in Xcode to embed in your full app.


127
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:37,197 line:-2
Then selectively include code,
assets and framework dependencies


128
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,732 line:-1
in your app clip.


129
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,335 line:0
To learn more about
bringing up an app clip target,


130
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,470 line:0
please refer to "Explore App Clips."


131
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:48,842 line:-2
After this, you need to make sure
your users can be linked to your app clip.


132
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,912 line:-2
To do this,
you need to set up associated domains,


133
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,215 line:-2
handle NSUserActivity
and configure app clip cards


134
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,452 line:-2
via the advanced section
of the App Store Connect.


135
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,589 line:-2
This lets your users access your app clip
through physical invocation methods


136
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:06,560 line:-2
such as by scanning an NFC tag,
QR code or app clip code.


137
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,898 line:0
To learn more, please refer to
"Configure and Link Your App Clips."


138
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:14,034 line:-2
Finally, to provide
an even better user experience,


139
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,304 line:-2
you should consider
streamlining transactions in your app clip


140
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,840 line:-1
with app clip-specific technologies,


141
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:23,143 line:-2
such as ephemeral notification,
location confirmation


142
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,047 line:-2
and seamless data migration
between your app clip to your full app


143
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,616 line:-1
using a secure shared group container.


144
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:33,820 line:0
To learn more about this, please refer to
"Streamline Your App Clip."


145
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,023 line:0
You will learn
all you need to build an app clip


146
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,058 line:0
based on your app from these sessions.


147
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,795 line:-2
Along the way,
you may also see a very familiar demoer.


148
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:45,566 line:-2
If you have watched the talks,
you're mostly ready to go.


149
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,302 line:-2
When creating app clip experiences
for other businesses


150
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,736 line:-1
instead of just your own,


151
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,673 line:-2
there are a few important considerations
to keep in mind:


152
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,108 line:-1
launching from notifications


153
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,878 line:-2
and directly launching
an app clip experience.


154
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,647 line:-2
Let's look at
launching from notifications first.


155
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:04,952 line:-2
The Food Grid app clip powers
a few app clip experiences on my device:


156
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:09,289 line:-1
Metatop+, Mandy and Jason, and Fantastico.


157
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,758 line:-2
Since notifications are delivered
to your app bundle


158
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,127 line:-2
instead of
a particular app clip experience,


159
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:19,233 line:-2
iOS needs additional information to route
the notification to the correct app clip.


160
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,469 line:-2
To do so, you should fill out
the targetContentIdentifier field


161
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:23,937 line:-1
in the notification payload


162
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,374 line:-2
with a URL describing
what your notification is about.


163
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,143 line:-2
iOS then performs
the longest prefix match,


164
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,347 line:-2
and since the targetContentIdentifier
has the prefix


165
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,883 line:-1
foodgrid.example/fantastico,


166
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,086 line:-2
it is routed to
the Fantastico app clip experience.


167
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:43,090 line:-2
For more information, please refer
to the developer documentation,


168
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:47,027 line:-2
"Enabling Notifications in App Clips,"
available at the following URL.


169
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:53,267 line:-2
Each app clip invocation comes with
an NSUserActivity of type browsing web.


170
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,604 line:-2
Naturally, you may be tempted
to always push your users to a new session


171
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,806 line:-1
with the URL from the user activity.


172
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,944 line:-2
However, it is important to make sure
you don't push or pop away


173
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,613 line:-2
if the URL corresponds
to the same session.


174
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,117 line:-2
Why is this?
Well, consider the following case.


175
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:15,389 line:-2
Your user has tapped on the Fantastico
app clip from the App Library.


176
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:19,459 line:-2
Food Grid gets a user activity,
parses the URL in the user activity


177
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,662 line:-1
and navigates to Fantastico.


178
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,965 line:-2
I'm really hungry,
so let's look at the menu.


179
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:29,336 line:-2
Now I've added some pancakes
and appetizers to my shopping cart.


180
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,272 line:-2
Imagine I'm interrupted
by an important message,


181
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,843 line:-2
switched to the Messages app
and went back to the Home Screen.


182
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,612 line:-2
Now, I've launched
the Fantastico app clip again


183
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,414 line:-1
from the App Library.


184
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,716 line:-1
Food Grid resumes from the background,


185
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,853 line:-2
and a new user activity
with the Fantastico URL


186
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,521 line:-1
is delivered to Food Grid,


187
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:51,291 line:-2
so Food Grid pushed a new screen
up the navigation stack.


188
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,193 line:-1
Without checking for current state,


189
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,864 line:-2
Food Grid started a new session
from the URL in the user activity.


190
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:01,301 line:-2
This means I have lost my order
during the previous session,


191
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,471 line:-2
even though the URL of both sessions
are the same.


192
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:07,508 line:-2
So, instead of doing this,
you should check if the URL


193
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:11,445 line:-2
in a new user activity corresponds
to the current, in-flight session


194
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:13,780 line:-1
before pushing or popping the user away.


195
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,486 line:-2
Finally, while app clips represent
and promote multiple businesses,


196
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,555 line:-1
they don't support multiple windows.


197
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,657 line:-1
Therefore, if you get a new user activity


198
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:26,527 line:-2
with a URL that corresponds
to a different business,


199
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,096 line:-2
you should consider
saving state or user data


200
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,665 line:-2
before moving to the new,
different session.


201
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,736 line:-1
This way, if your user later comes back


202
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,572 line:-2
to an app clip experience
that has a saved state,


203
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,775 line:-2
you can seamlessly restore
back to this state to your user.


204
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:46,079 line:-2
The expectation that each business
you represent has its own app clip is met,


205
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,483 line:-2
and from the user's perspective,
they are just using multiple app clips,


206
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,052 line:-2
even though they are backed
by a single binary.


207
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,887 line:-1
When archiving your full app,


208
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,390 line:-2
Xcode will automatically
embed the app clip


209
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:58,192 line:-1
within your full app's archive.


210
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,660 line:-1
To submit it for review,


211
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:02,196 line:-2
upload the full app
with the embedded app clip


212
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,732 line:-2
as a single submission
using Xcode or Transporter.


213
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,268 line:0
To learn more about
submitting app clips to the App Store,


214
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,505 line:0
please refer to
"What's New in App Store Connect."


215
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:15,342 line:-2
After you have submitted your app
and app clip to App Store Connect,


216
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,712 line:-2
it's time to create an app clip experience
for each business you promote


217
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,180 line:-1
in App Store Connect.


218
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,283 line:-2
To do so, create a new
advanced app clip experience


219
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,118 line:-1
in App Store Connect,


220
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,021 line:-1
specify an app clip experience URL,


221
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:32,125 line:-2
choose to promote a different business
and send it to Apple for review.


222
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,662 line:-2
You'll learn more about creating
advanced app clip experiences this fall,


223
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:39,299 line:-2
but today, I'll quickly walk you toward
how to set things up.


224
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,468 line:-2
On the App Store Connect page
for your app clip,


225
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:45,706 line:-2
if you scroll down, there's
an Advanced App Clip Experiences section.


226
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,308 line:-1
In it, there is a Get Started button.


227
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,745 line:-2
Click on it, and you'll be taken
to an advanced app clip experience.


228
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,382 line:-1
When creating a new app clip experience,


229
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,719 line:-2
specify an app clip experience URL
and click Next.


230
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,123 line:-2
When asked about what is presented
in the app clip experience,


231
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,959 line:-2
you can choose to promote
a different business, service


232
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,095 line:-1
or brand powered by your app.


233
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,163 line:-1
Choose the right radio button


234
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,699 line:-2
and send your app clip experience
for review.


235
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:13,800 line:-1
That's it!


236
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,970 line:-1
Of course, the app clip card


237
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,474 line:-2
is how your users discover
the app clips you have created.


238
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,809 line:-2
It is also where
the business you're promoting


239
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,978 line:-1
or representing should really shine.


240
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:29,149 line:-2
So it's not only really important
to make a great first impression,


241
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:33,754 line:-2
but it's also the perfect opportunity
to establish a strong brand identity


242
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,923 line:-1
of the business with your app clip.


243
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:40,661 line:-2
Let's take a look
at setting up the app clip card.


244
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:44,665 line:-2
You can individually set up app clip cards
per business in App Store Connect,


245
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:48,936 line:-2
and you get to customize
the header image, display title, subtitle,


246
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,472 line:-2
location association
and action per business.


247
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,743 line:0
For more details, please refer to
the "Design Great App Clips" video.


248
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,647 line:-2
Next, I'll briefly walk over
setting up the app clip card.


249
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:05,319 line:-2
When creating a new advanced
app clip experience in App Store Connect,


250
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,655 line:-2
you'll be given the option
to customize your app clip card.


251
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,824 line:-1
So first, header image.


252
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:15,462 line:-2
The header image should be representative
of the business your app clip promotes.


253
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,698 line:-1
It should use rich image and graphics


254
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:21,068 line:-2
that represents the business you're
promoting in the best light possible.


255
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,605 line:-2
So you should not show text or ads
in the header image.


256
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,341 line:-2
The header image is shown
in both the app clip card


257
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,577 line:-2
and the loading screen
with a vibrant background effect.


258
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,680 line:-2
There are some additional
format requirements to keep in mind.


259
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:38,285 line:-2
The header image is displayed
in 3:2 under aspect fill mode.


260
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:41,421 line:-2
You should strive to upload
the highest quality image available,


261
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:46,627 line:0
and the recommended image size
is 3,000 pixels by 2,000 pixels.


262
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,596 line:0
Apple will automatically take care
of downscaling the image


263
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,231 line:0
when showing the app clip card


264
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,801 line:0
so that it loads quickly
in a variety of network conditions.


265
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:58,639 line:0
To make sure the image
remains crisp and clear


266
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,008 line:0
after it has been
automatically downscaled,


267
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:05,045 line:0
it is, again, important for you
to upload the highest quality original.


268
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,715 line:0
The image should be in PNG or JPG format,


269
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:12,853 line:0
and since transparency is not supported,
the image should be fully opaque.


270
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,889 line:0
Let's drag Fantastico.png
into App Store Connect


271
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,324 line:0
to update the header image.


272
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,828 line:0
Next, let's look at the title
and the subtitle.


273
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,397 line:0
Because attribution to your app


274
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,133 line:0
is already shown
at the bottom of your app clip card,


275
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,269 line:0
the title and subtitle here
should always represent the business


276
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,939 line:0
your app clip is promoting,
not your app itself.


277
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:36,643 line:0
If the business you're promoting has
presence in multiple regions or locales,


278
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,581 line:-2
you should consider localizing
both the display title and the subtitle,


279
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,683 line:-1
so that information on the app clip card


280
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,185 line:-2
can be read and understood
by global users.


281
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:49,723 line:0
Now, let's give our app clip card
a default display title and subtitle.


282
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:55,863 line:0
Finally, for the action, you can choose
from a pre-defined list of actions


283
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,265 line:0
such as Open, View and Play.


284
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:01,435 line:0
Additional actions are available
in the context of the Maps app


285
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:03,971 line:0
if your app clip
is tied to a physical place.


286
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:08,408 line:0
These actions
are also automatically localized.


287
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,377 line:0
We look forward to hearing your feedback


288
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:13,981 line:0
for additional actions you would
like to display in the app clip card.


289
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,883 line:0
Let's configure an action.


290
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,819 line:0
I'll choose "Open (Order Food)" here,


291
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:22,222 line:0
and the app clip card preview
has updated accordingly.


292
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,092 line:-1
And that is setting up the app clip card.


293
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,396 line:-2
Another core part of your app clip
branding and identity are icons.


294
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,800 line:-2
There are a few different types of icons
in the context of app clips.


295
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:39,239 line:-2
First, app icon. This has existed
before iOS 14 and app clips.


296
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,475 line:-1
It is newly shown in the app clip card


297
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:45,746 line:-2
because the app clip experience is
powered by technologies in your full app.


298
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,315 line:-2
It is shown in the App Banner
within your app clip,


299
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:51,451 line:-2
because the App Banner refers users
to download your full app.


300
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:56,390 line:-2
What's new here is the app clip icon
and the app clip experience icon.


301
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,625 line:-2
Let's go over both of these
in more detail.


302
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:03,964 line:-2
The app clip icon is shown when iOS
is generally referring to your app clip,


303
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:06,533 line:-2
but it is not referring
to a specific business


304
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,036 line:-2
you're representing
or promoting with your app clip.


305
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,405 line:-1
In other words, it represents an app clip,


306
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,575 line:-2
but does not represent
a specific app clip experience.


307
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:19,313 line:-2
It is shown across the iOS system UI
just like your app icon,


308
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,083 line:-2
such as in the multitasking switcher,
Notifications and in Settings.


309
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,688 line:-2
iOS automatically applies
a beautiful treatment to your app icon.


310
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:31,325 line:-2
Therefore, you should continue
to create square, opaque icons.


311
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,026 line:-1
Your icon is scaled down,


312
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:37,197 line:-2
and a distinctive border treatment
indicates to users this is an app clip.


313
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:41,568 line:-2
The most distinctive type of icon
is the app clip experience icon,


314
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,404 line:-2
which is sometimes also referred to
as the business icon.


315
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:48,175 line:-2
The icon always represents
a particular app clip experience,


316
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:51,612 line:-2
and even if your app clip powers
multiple app clip experiences,


317
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:55,382 line:-2
each experience gets its own icon
to stand out in system UI.


318
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,985 line:-1
From a technical perspective,


319
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:02,122 line:-2
the app clip experience icon
is always associated with a URL,


320
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,358 line:-2
and tapping on
the app clip experience icon


321
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:07,426 line:-2
always launches the app clip
with the experience URL.


322
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:12,299 line:-2
The app clip experience icon is visible
across the system UI experience,


323
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:16,837 line:-2
and you'll see it in Recently Added folder
in the App Library, in Spotlight Search,


324
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:19,806 line:-2
location and usage-based
Proactive suggestions,


325
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,844 line:-2
as well as built-in apps
like Messages, Maps and Safari.


326
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:25,746 line:-1
I know what you're all wondering:


327
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,214 line:-2
"Where do these
app clip experience icons come from?"


328
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:33,854 line:-2
Well, app clip experience icons
match the Maps Point of Interest icons


329
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:36,156 line:-1
for businesses with a physical presence.


330
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,891 line:-1
So it's customizable.


331
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,427 line:-2
Businesses can upload an icon
to Maps Connect


332
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:42,196 line:-1
for their app clip experience.


333
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,599 line:-2
If the business or app clip experience
has no icon,


334
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:49,603 line:-2
iOS will then automatically fall back
to the generic category icon,


335
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,006 line:-2
such as theater, shopping,
food and parking.


336
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,242 line:-1
To wrap things up,


337
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,212 line:-2
if your app represents
or promotes multiple businesses,


338
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:01,815 line:-2
you should consider creating advanced
app clip experiences for all of them.


339
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,417 line:-1
To create an app clip,


340
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:06,553 line:-2
you can use the same technologies
you use to build an app.


341
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,255 line:-1
App clips are easy to build.


342
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:12,426 line:-2
Just selectively include parts of your app
in your app clip build target as needed,


343
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,762 line:-2
be it code, assets
or framework dependencies.


344
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,999 line:-2
You should consider using
app clip-specific technologies,


345
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:22,803 line:-2
such as one-time location confirmation
or ephemeral notifications,


346
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,972 line:-1
to further streamline the experience.


347
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,308 line:-2
Store data and credentials
in a secure shared group container


348
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,311 line:-2
so that when your users
upgrade from the app clip to the full app,


349
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,881 line:-1
user data can be automatically migrated.


350
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:37,985 line:-2
Finally, you should upload
unique metadata and icon


351
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,420 line:-1
of each app clip experience you create,


352
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,323 line:-2
so that the brand identity
of every business you promote


353
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,493 line:-2
shines through the app clip card
and across system UI.


354
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,663 line:-2
That's "Create App Clips
for Other Businesses."


355
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,433 line:-2
Thank you for watching this video,
and have a great WWDC!
