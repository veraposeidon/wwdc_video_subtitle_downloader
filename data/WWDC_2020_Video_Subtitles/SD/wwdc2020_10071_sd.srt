00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,273 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,345 line:0
Hi, I'm Jess. I'm on the Siri team.


3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:15,449 line:-2
I'm a conversational interaction designer,
which is a fancy way of saying


4
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:19,119 line:-2
that I think about the kinds of things
people should be able to do with Siri.


5
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,788 line:-2
I'm going to talk about
these two things today.


6
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,926 line:-2
So first, let's talk about
what you can do with Siri.


7
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,561 line:-1
To get at the heart of it,


8
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:31,231 line:-2
let's first dig into what we at Apple mean
when we refer to "Siri"


9
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,299 line:-1
in the first place.


10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:36,170 line:-2
You may be familiar with this bit
from the Siri Human Interface Guidelines.


11
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:40,140 line:-2
Siri makes it easy for people
to accomplish their everyday tasks quickly


12
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,943 line:-1
using Voice, Touch or Automation.


13
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:48,749 line:-2
This means that Siri should be equally
as powerful and enjoyable to use


14
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,685 line:-2
across all these modalities
for all supported tasks.


15
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:56,490 line:-2
As a conversation designer, I, of course,
want to focus today on Voice.


16
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,126 line:-2
There are many parts
of the overall Voice experience,


17
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:03,864 line:-2
including the assistant, Intents,
Shortcuts, Suggestions, Automations.


18
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,799 line:-1
Siri is a lot of things.


19
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,467 line:-1
First, let's look at Siri,


20
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:11,038 line:-2
the conversational assistant available
on your Apple devices.


21
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,307 line:-1
Siri helps you do all kinds of things,


22
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,476 line:-2
including get information,
like the weather,


23
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,613 line:-2
an answer to a math problem
or hours of a local business.


24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,750 line:-2
Complete tasks, like calling a loved one,
setting a calendar event


25
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,720 line:-1
or checking important Reminders.


26
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,289 line:-2
And pass the time
with all kinds of conversation


27
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,725 line:-1
from asking for jokes to hearing a story.


28
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,232 line:-2
All of us at Siri work hard
to make a great assistant,


29
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,268 line:-2
but there are ways that you can help it
become even better.


30
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,938 line:-2
Let's look at what you, as a developer,
can do with Siri.


31
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:49,209 line:-2
It all starts with intents.
But what even are intents?


32
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,113 line:-2
Conceptually, intents are how
we a speak a common language.


33
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,582 line:-2
That definitely sounds like
something we want to do,


34
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,417 line:-1
but what does it mean in practice?


35
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,521 line:-1
Let's take a look at some examples.


36
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:05,259 line:-2
An intent helps answer this question:
What is sending a message?


37
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:09,162 line:-2
Well, think about what is
actually involved when a message is sent.


38
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,399 line:-2
We need to know
who you want to send the message to.


39
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,936 line:-2
And we definitely need to know
what you want to say in your message.


40
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:21,341 line:-2
We've defined really powerful natural
language support for some key experiences


41
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,110 line:-1
in what we call domains,


42
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:27,414 line:-2
that group related intents
to do the things people do every day.


43
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,884 line:-2
You'll see these groups referred to
as System Intents.


44
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:36,757 line:-2
These intents come with the conversational
flow that's needed to complete a request.


45
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:41,195 line:-2
Do you need to ask what music to play
or say a message has been sent?


46
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,063 line:-1
Comes with. Just add your data.


47
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:46,099 line:-2
Of course, there are still some things
you should think about


48
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,001 line:-1
from the design perspective here.


49
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,738 line:-2
While most of what Siri will say
has been written for you,


50
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,074 line:-2
you should still make sure
that the dialogue sounds good


51
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,076 line:-1
with your data in it,


52
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,679 line:-1
both from a sentence structure perspective


53
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,681 line:-1
and a text-to-speech perspective.


54
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,617 line:-2
And error cases
are always really important,


55
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,953 line:-1
so that people understand what's happened,


56
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,323 line:-2
which means
you should pay special attention here


57
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,260 line:-2
and make sure that the errors
or unsupported cases in your app


58
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,529 line:-1
map to the dialogue that Siri provides.


59
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:19,032 line:-2
But what about other stuff,
like what is it to order coffee?


60
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:23,370 line:-2
Well, you tell us.
You're the expert on your use case.


61
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,073 line:-2
That's where custom intents
come into play.


62
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,610 line:-2
With custom intents,
the conversational flow isn't provided.


63
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,646 line:-2
But as I said,
you're the expert on your use case,


64
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,782 line:-2
so that puts you in an excellent position
to create this flow.


65
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,486 line:-2
Just think through the logic
of your use case.


66
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:43,991 line:-2
What steps does someone need to take?
What information do they need to provide?


67
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,826 line:-1
And how would you talk them through it?


68
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,396 line:-2
What words do you use,
what order do you ask for things?


69
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:53,133 line:-2
In addition to intents,
we should also talk about Shortcuts.


70
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:56,870 line:-2
Shortcuts is an umbrella term
for a lot of functionality.


71
00:03:56,937 --> 00:04:00,474 line:-2
Shortcuts are a great tool for developers
to make their functionality


72
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,010 line:-1
even easier for people to access.


73
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,781 line:-2
They also empower people to create their
own routines for things they like to do


74
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,384 line:-1
and then share those routines with others.


75
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,354 line:-2
Under the Shortcuts umbrella,
there's Suggestions.


76
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,725 line:-2
Siri can suggest a Shortcut for an action
someone has done at least one time.


77
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,628 line:-2
It can surface these suggestions
in a variety of ways,


78
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,565 line:-2
making for a more personalized
Siri experience


79
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:28,435 line:-2
and a quick and easy way
to access your app's functionality.


80
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:32,105 line:-2
Siri can also suggest Shortcuts
for actions people haven't done yet,


81
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:35,108 line:-2
but might want to do,
based on what they've done before.


82
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,711 line:-1
The Shortcuts app.


83
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,882 line:-2
In the app, people can find premade
Shortcuts for all kinds of actions,


84
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,084 line:-1
both fun and useful.


85
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:47,054 line:-1
They can also create Automations,


86
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,256 line:-2
which can run directly
on a person's device


87
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,625 line:-1
or can be used by everyone at Home.


88
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,827 line:-2
Just set up the right conditions
to run the actions,


89
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:57,598 line:-2
like time of day, location
or when a specific event happens.


90
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,834 line:-1
Last, but certainly not least, Voice.


91
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,805 line:-2
These Shortcuts are powered by the
custom intents we talked about earlier.


92
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,708 line:-2
They enable people
to access your in-app functionality


93
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,776 line:-1
without having to open the app


94
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,346 line:-2
and allow people to add actions
from your app


95
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,848 line:-2
into Automations
that they may want to set up.


96
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,051 line:-2
Now that we've talked
about the ways you can add to Siri,


97
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:21,321 line:-2
let's turn our attention
to what to add to Siri.


98
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:24,625 line:-2
Voice shouldn't just be
about filling out forms.


99
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,093 line:-1
That can be useful,


100
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,196 line:-2
but speaking answers one by one
to a bunch of fields


101
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,164 line:-2
isn't what makes
a great voice interaction.


102
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,835 line:-2
Voice is great
for simplifying multistep interactions,


103
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,437 line:-2
especially ones
that are completed frequently.


104
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,039 line:-1
Think about playing music.


105
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,776 line:-2
If you want to play
your favorite artist's newest album,


106
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,745 line:-1
you first need to open the app.


107
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,947 line:-2
Then you either need to know
the name of the album


108
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,616 line:-2
or search through the band's whole catalog
to find it.


109
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,418 line:-1
At last, you can play it.


110
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,756 line:-2
With Voice, you can say,
"Play the latest album by DaBaby,"


111
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,927 line:-2
and let the app do the heavy lifting of
figuring out what it's supposed to play.


112
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,162 line:-1
It's less steps, which is great,


113
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,933 line:-2
but there's also less required from people
to accomplish their goal.


114
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,670 line:-2
Sometimes,
apps are laid out with several steps


115
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,506 line:-2
before the actual task
people want to complete.


116
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,741 line:-1
Imagine our old friend Soup Chef.


117
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,678 line:-2
You have to look at the menu
before you can select a soup,


118
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,547 line:-2
even if you know
exactly what you want to order.


119
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:24,718 line:-2
That in-app hierarchy is important
to help people who are new to your app


120
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,486 line:-1
know what there is to do.


121
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,922 line:-2
But people who order your soup
all the time


122
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,226 line:-2
don't need to see the menu to know
they want to order the tomato bisque.


123
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:36,063 line:-2
Voice accelerates them past
the information they no longer need


124
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,232 line:-2
and gets them right
to where they want to be--


125
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,000 line:-1
ordering a delicious bowl of soup.


126
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,936 line:-2
And maybe you have
some power users of your app


127
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:46,440 line:-2
who frequently access something that's
not prominently featured in your UI,


128
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,574 line:-1
like Settings.


129
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,877 line:-1
This is a great fit for Voice.


130
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:53,213 line:-2
People who love that feature
will be able to access it quickly.


131
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,917 line:-2
And remember that people can use
their voice even when they're driving,


132
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:01,321 line:-2
walking with AirPods or otherwise unable
to get to your app on their phone.


133
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,424 line:-2
Voice is great for things people
want to do when they're multitasking.


134
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,060 line:-1
In addition to having a great feature set,


135
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,764 line:-2
you also want to ensure your experience
has great conversation.


136
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,534 line:-1
Taking advantage of available modalities


137
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,336 line:-2
is a great step
towards natural conversation.


138
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,907 line:-2
Let's take a quick look at the two modes
Siri can use to communicate.


139
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,142 line:-1
First up, silent mode.


140
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:26,680 line:-2
In iOS 14,
if the iPhone ringer switch is muted,


141
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:29,249 line:-1
Siri will be in silent mode by default.


142
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:33,086 line:-2
As implied by the name,
Siri doesn't speak in silent mode.


143
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:37,224 line:-2
Instead, the screen UI
and, where relevant, printed dialogue


144
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,194 line:-2
work together to present
all the information people need


145
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,795 line:-1
to complete their task.


146
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,031 line:-1
And then there's Voice mode.


147
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:47,634 line:-2
Here, while an available screen
will still show UI,


148
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:51,538 line:-2
Siri speaks out all the information
people need to complete the task.


149
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,108 line:-2
Siri:<i>Your message to Eden says,</i>
<i>"Want to get coffee later?"</i>


150
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,643 line:-1
<i>Ready to send it?</i>


151
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:01,582 line:-2
How you adopt these modes depends
on what solution you've implemented.


152
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,718 line:-2
System intents have a lot of functionality
baked into them,


153
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,588 line:-2
including handling
these different interaction modes.


154
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,591 line:-2
You don't have to do anything
to get this working for people.


155
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,094 line:-2
Custom intents do require a little work
to support this,


156
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,163 line:-1
but the tooling makes it easy.


157
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,000 line:-2
Just indicate what dialogue and UI
you want Siri to use


158
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,069 line:-1
when people are looking at the screen


159
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,204 line:-1
and what you want to use when they aren't.


160
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:28,008 line:-2
Siri will ensure the right pieces are used
at the right time.


161
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,979 line:-2
So, now that you know the modes
Siri can communicate in,


162
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,615 line:-1
let's talk about what Siri actually says.


163
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,717 line:-1
One of the things the Siri team works on


164
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:40,287 line:-2
is ensuring Siri doesn't speak
more than it needs to.


165
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,857 line:-2
So, where appropriate,
Siri will use shorter dialogue


166
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:47,027 line:-2
once people are familiar
with a piece of functionality.


167
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,996 line:-1
Let's take a look at an example.


168
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:53,534 line:-2
Here, Siri provides more information the
first time you ask to change a setting.


169
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,438 line:-2
The second time,
people don't need the same detail.


170
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:03,510 line:-2
One of the places where Siri does this
is in attribution,


171
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:06,780 line:-2
or letting people know
where information is coming from.


172
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:10,551 line:-2
If you build a custom intent
and you do your job well,


173
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,387 line:-1
people will use your shortcut a lot.


174
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:17,324 line:-2
In that case, Siri will stop including
the attribution for your shortcut


175
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,992 line:-1
when people access it.


176
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,896 line:-2
But that means you have a responsibility
to have conversational dialogue.


177
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:27,367 line:-2
And so, here are some things
to keep in mind to help you do that.


178
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,003 line:0
Questions are a great
conversational marker.


179
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,172 line:0
They let people know
you're expecting an answer,


180
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:36,176 line:0
so be sure to use them when people need
to provide information to continue.


181
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,046 line:-1
Try to avoid jargon in your dialogue.


182
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,249 line:-2
You're an expert on your use case,
but other people might not be.


183
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,153 line:-2
Use best practices for spoken English,
not written English.


184
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,423 line:-2
This keeps it feeling,
well, conversational.


185
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,392 line:-2
And as much as possible,
keep dialogue short.


186
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,062 line:-2
It's hard for people to remember
everything they hear.


187
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,232 line:-1
Thanks for watching and enjoy WWDC.
