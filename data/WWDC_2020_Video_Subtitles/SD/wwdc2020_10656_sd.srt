00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:06,540 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,278 line:0
Hello, folks! My name is Edith
and I'm a motion scientist


3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,247 line:0
on Apple's software engineering team.


4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,984 line:-2
Today, I'm joined by Dan Trietsch,
a motion engineer,


5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,089 line:-2
to introduce a new set of metrics
now available on iOS and watchOS


6
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,391 line:-2
that enable customers
to measure their movement


7
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,059 line:-1
in groundbreaking ways.


8
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:30,130 line:-2
In this session,
we'll introduce these metrics


9
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:35,169 line:-2
and provide guidance for app developers
who want to go beyond simple step-counting


10
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,205 line:-2
to create a rich understanding
of a customer's mobility.


11
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:41,508 line:-1
Movement is a key indicator of health.


12
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,945 line:-2
The way someone moves
can tell us about their short-term health,


13
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:48,148 line:-2
like recovery
from a musculoskeletal injury,


14
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,816 line:-1
and their long-term health,


15
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,419 line:-2
like their ability to age
with independence.


16
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,589 line:-2
Movement is affected
by a variety of health conditions


17
00:00:55,656 --> 00:01:00,394 line:-2
like neurological disease
and cardiopulmonary fitness.


18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,730 line:-2
One of the primary ways
that we measure movement


19
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,133 line:-1
is observing how someone walks.


20
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,469 line:-2
Walking is something
many people do every day


21
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,338 line:-1
and might take for granted,


22
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:16,910 line:-2
but it's actually pretty amazing how many
systems have to come together to do it.


23
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:21,114 line:-2
Walking requires coordination,
strength and fitness.


24
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:26,420 line:-2
Our muscles, brain and heart
are constantly working when we do it.


25
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:30,858 line:-2
Measuring walking is a great way
to see changes in health,


26
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:35,162 line:-2
but measuring how someone walks
is surprisingly complicated.


27
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,899 line:-2
It requires trips
to in-clinic appointments


28
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,169 line:-2
and extensive evaluation
with specialized equipment.


29
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,404 line:-1
This is a hallway,


30
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,542 line:-2
and it's a setting for one of
the most used clinical walking tests,


31
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,744 line:-1
the six-minute walk test.


32
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,614 line:-1
Patients are asked to walk back and forth,


33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,617 line:-1
to go as far as they can in six minutes.


34
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:00,888 line:-2
The faster and more continuously
they walk, the higher the number.


35
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,024 line:-2
The total distance covered
is a great indicator


36
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,260 line:-1
in a wide range of health scenarios.


37
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:13,600 line:-2
But to do this test properly,
it requires 30 meters of clear hallway


38
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,603 line:-2
to make sure the person isn't spending
more time turning around


39
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,472 line:-1
than they are walking.


40
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,175 line:-2
How many of us
have this kind of space at home


41
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,244 line:-2
to check in on our progress
between clinic visits?


42
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,182 line:-2
Questionnaires are a less time-
and resource-intensive tool


43
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,750 line:-1
to evaluate walking.


44
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,153 line:-2
Asking a person to report
their level of difficulty or pain


45
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,389 line:-1
when walking is helpful,


46
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,358 line:-2
but questionnaires rely on memory
and perception.


47
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:42,196 line:-2
There are systems for measuring movement
much more precisely.


48
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,365 line:-2
Motion-capture technology
is a very precise method


49
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:48,168 line:-2
to detect small changes
in a person's movement,


50
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,904 line:-1
but it requires expensive equipment,


51
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:54,408 line:-2
specialized cameras and markers
like you can see here,


52
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:59,279 line:-2
and trained technicians
to gather, process and analyze the data.


53
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:04,852 line:-2
Overall, even the best of these approaches
is only a rare snapshot.


54
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,388 line:-2
It's a substitute for the question
that really matters--


55
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,792 line:-1
how are you moving in your everyday life?


56
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,929 line:-2
iPhone and Apple Watch,
devices people carry every day,


57
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:19,132 line:-2
can now bring the motion lab
into the real world,


58
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,835 line:-1
filling the gap between research and life.


59
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,172 line:-1
New to iOS and watchOS,


60
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,942 line:-2
Apple is introducing
a category of metrics to HealthKit


61
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:33,180 line:-2
that capture the complex and important
elements of human movement,


62
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:36,650 line:-2
all while a customer walks around
with their iPhone in their pocket


63
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,418 line:-1
or their Apple Watch on their wrist.


64
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,022 line:-2
Customers can view these metrics
in the Health app,


65
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:45,826 line:-2
and developers can use them in their apps
through the HealthKit API.


66
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:52,466 line:-2
Four of the new mobility metrics
are calculated on iPhone.


67
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:57,337 line:-1
The first two metrics are walking speed,


68
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:02,142 line:-2
how fast a person travels over ground,
and step length.


69
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,947 line:-2
Is a person taking short, cautious steps
or long, confident strides?


70
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,917 line:-2
These metrics are sensitive
to slow walking


71
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,352 line:-1
and can detect small changes,


72
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,322 line:-2
tasks that traditional pedometers
struggle with.


73
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:22,262 line:-2
Two other iPhone metrics measure
walking quality--


74
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,730 line:-1
double-support time,


75
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,733 line:-2
which is the percentage of time
during a walk


76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,337 line:-2
when both feet are in contact
with the ground,


77
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,072 line:-1
and walking asymmetry,


78
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,042 line:-2
which is the percentage of time
that steps with one foot


79
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,311 line:-2
are faster or slower
than steps with the other foot.


80
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,548 line:-2
While step counters and pedometers
measure all walking in a day,


81
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:45,886 line:-2
these new metrics intelligently gather
the most valuable bouts of walking


82
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:51,124 line:-2
during consistent conditions,
over flat ground in a continuous segment,


83
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:55,028 line:-2
resulting in precise measures
that resemble standardized walking tests.


84
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:59,600 line:-2
The other four mobility metrics are
calculated only for Apple Watch wearers.


85
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,838 line:-2
In addition to counting flights of stairs,
Apple Watch can now record


86
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:09,243 line:-2
how fast a person goes
up or down a flight of stairs.


87
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,413 line:-2
Two features synthesize together
multiple data sources


88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,352 line:-2
to make predictions of what a person
could do at their highest effort.


89
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,355 line:-2
First, remember that standardized
walking test I mentioned?


90
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,557 line:-1
The six-minute walk distance?


91
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:28,595 line:-2
Apple Watch now uses activity clues
that happen naturally over a week


92
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,498 line:-2
to estimate what a person
would have scored on that test.


93
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,404 line:-2
And finally, VO2 max is not new,
but now it's more accurate


94
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,741 line:-2
and it's better for people
with lower levels of fitness.


95
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,143 line:-1
Instead of requiring running-level effort,


96
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,581 line:-2
Apple Watch can now predict VO2 max
using slower walking speeds.


97
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,351 line:-1
These metrics build on APIs


98
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,854 line:-2
that measure movement
with iPhone and Apple Watch,


99
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:57,357 line:-2
like CMPedometer,
which is used to track steps,


100
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:01,828 line:-2
cadence, distance, pace,
and flights of stairs,


101
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,665 line:-2
and HealthKit,
which aggregates these metrics


102
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,669 line:-2
to add calories, exercise minutes,
and workouts from Apple Watch.


103
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,074 line:0
You can find more resources
on these technologies


104
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:18,979 line:0
in WWDC talks from 2017 and 2018.


105
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,381 line:-1
That's a lot of new information


106
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,784 line:-2
and there are
so many possible applications


107
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,820 line:-2
for this new collection
of mobility metrics,


108
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:31,992 line:-2
but today, we'll focus in on one scenario
where these data could be helpful--


109
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,462 line:-1
recovery from a musculoskeletal injury.


110
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,832 line:-2
We'll show you how to access
and use these data types


111
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,034 line:-1
to create a rich user experience.


112
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,571 line:-1
Imagine you have a customer named Jamie,


113
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,441 line:-2
who just injured their ankle
while training for a 5K.


114
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:52,412 line:-2
While Jamie is still able to walk around
and complete daily tasks,


115
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,482 line:-2
they want to track progress
during rehab and recovery,


116
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,484 line:-1
and how far there is to go.


117
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,988 line:-2
Recovering from an injury
is often a slow process,


118
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:05,225 line:-2
and it can be hard to recognize
and celebrate small increments of progress


119
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:10,297 line:-2
to stay motivated in between visits
to the doctor and physical therapist.


120
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,900 line:-1
What can you do to help fill in the gaps?


121
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,537 line:-1
In the next few slides,


122
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,940 line:-2
we'll use the mobility metrics
to show Jamie their progress


123
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,209 line:-2
and help them put
their recovery in context.


124
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,980 line:-2
For details about syncing data
with HealthKit


125
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:32,252 line:0
or making apps in CareKit,
check out these past WWDC sessions.


126
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:38,058 line:-2
We're going to break today's work up
into three steps.


127
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,729 line:-2
First, how to measure walking by querying
one of the new mobility data types.


128
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:47,835 line:-2
Second, how to aggregate the data
to see changes over time.


129
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,671 line:-2
And finally,
how to bring in other data types


130
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:54,241 line:-2
to build and interpret
a holistic picture of walking.


131
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,343 line:-1
First, what should you measure?


132
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:01,014 line:-2
You'll start by showing Jamie
their walking speed


133
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,483 line:-1
using the new HKQuantityType.


134
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,752 line:-2
There are a lot of pedometers
out there already,


135
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,123 line:-2
including one on iPhone and Apple Watch,
that measure walking quantity.


136
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,061 line:-2
They're optimized to count
as much walking as possible.


137
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,864 line:-2
But this measure is designed
to capture small changes


138
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,934 line:-2
in how they're doing that walking,
so it works a little differently.


139
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,737 line:-1
It doesn't need calibration against GPS,


140
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:27,174 line:-2
making it consistent and easy
to compare values over time.


141
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,977 line:-1
It's accurate at slow walking speeds,


142
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,513 line:-2
so it works for people
with limited mobility


143
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,448 line:-2
and can capture
even those early days of recovery.


144
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,219 line:-1
It's sensitive to even small changes.


145
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,491 line:-2
By design,
it doesn't count all the walking.


146
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:47,227 line:-1
Instead, you'll see a start and stop time


147
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:50,430 line:-2
for samples of continuous walking
on flat ground,


148
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,633 line:-2
which makes walking bouts
easier to compare.


149
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59,706 line:-2
And because it's passively collected
on the motion coprocessor all day,


150
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:04,011 line:-2
any time Jamie carries their iPhone
in a pocket or on their hip,


151
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,748 line:-2
they can have measurements
dating back to before the injury happened,


152
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:11,618 line:-2
which allows pre-
and post-injury comparison.


153
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:15,189 line:-2
Now, Dan will walk through
how to use this metric.


154
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,959 line:-2
First things first, since walking speed
is a HealthKit quantity type,


155
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,528 line:-2
we will need to ask Jamie
for permission to read their data.


156
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:25,432 line:-2
For our app, we are not planning
on writing new data back into HealthKit,


157
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:28,302 line:-1
so we only request read access.


158
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:31,071 line:-2
Next, we will construct a query
for walking-speed samples


159
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,173 line:-1
around the time of Jamie's recent injury.


160
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,743 line:-2
Let's assume that they have already
shared with us the date of their injury.


161
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,847 line:-2
Let's set our query bounds
beginning 30 days before the injury


162
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,515 line:-1
so we can establish a baseline speed,


163
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:46,019 line:-2
and ending 60 days later,
so we can track their recovery progress.


164
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,423 line:-2
Then, we specify the type of data
we're interested in, walking speed,


165
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,525 line:-1
and how we want it to be sorted.


166
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,260 line:-1
As soon as we execute this query,


167
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:56,129 line:-2
our callback will receive
all of the matching HKSamples.


168
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,832 line:-2
Be aware,
depending on Jamie's activity level,


169
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,134 line:-2
this query could return
hundreds of walking samples.


170
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:05,372 line:-2
Now that we have Jamie's query results,
we need a way to visualize the data.


171
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,475 line:-2
Fortunately for us,
Apple has a pair of frameworks


172
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:12,446 line:-2
to chart and graph our results,
CareKit and ResearchKit.


173
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:16,950 line:-2
In today's example, we'll be using
ResearchKit's graphChartViews.


174
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,086 line:-2
Specifically,
ResearchKit's lineGraphChartView


175
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,220 line:-1
and discreteGraphChartView


176
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,124 line:-2
will provide an excellent way for us to
visualize Jamie's query results over time.


177
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:28,428 line:-2
For each sample, we append our results
to an array of ValueRange objects.


178
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,331 line:-2
Then we have a function we added,
updatePlotPoints,


179
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,534 line:-1
to our ChartViewDataSource object.


180
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,902 line:-1
Finally, we have our graphChartView


181
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,838 line:-2
reload our data in the UI
on the main queue.


182
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,641 line:-2
In this graph,
we're presenting walking-speed results


183
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,177 line:-1
in ResearchKit's discreteGraphChartView.


184
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,611 line:-1
That's quite a bit of data!


185
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,115 line:-2
Jamie's injury date is at day zero
on the x-axis.


186
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:52,352 line:-2
Notice that because we're plotting Jamie's
full range of walking speeds by day,


187
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,888 line:-2
it's difficult for us to know
where most of the data is distributed


188
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,924 line:-1
within any particular day.


189
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,258 line:-1
However, just from this plot,


190
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,428 line:-2
we are starting to see the impact
of injury on Jamie's walking speed.


191
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,563 line:-1
Edith, what's next?


192
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:07,234 line:-2
All right, Dan got us started
with a straightforward visualization


193
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:10,370 line:-1
of the raw values for walking speed.


194
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,239 line:-1
However, you could probably see


195
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:15,676 line:-2
that with a passively measured
all-day metric like this,


196
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,078 line:-1
there's a lot of data to make sense of.


197
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:22,349 line:-2
The next step toward
a simple but insightful experience


198
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,919 line:-2
is to aggregate the raw data
into something more meaningful


199
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,721 line:-1
for the recovery process.


200
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:32,526 line:-2
In the first plot of all the daily data,
the injury was striking,


201
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:36,163 line:-2
but it was harder to see
the more subtle recovery.


202
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,132 line:-2
When working with
"all-day-every-day" data,


203
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,569 line:-2
not all walking is going to have
the same meaning.


204
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:46,940 line:-2
Think about the many things
that could impact a person's walking speed


205
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,642 line:-1
other than their health.


206
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,377 line:-1
Maybe they're rushing to a meeting.


207
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:54,381 line:-2
Maybe they're walking a dog
that likes to stop and smell everything.


208
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:58,685 line:-2
Maybe they spend some time walking with
a partner who is slower than they are.


209
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:02,322 line:-2
As a developer, you,
and maybe some friendly domain experts,


210
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,792 line:-2
like doctors, physical therapists
or biomechanists,


211
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:09,162 line:-2
will need to find the right way
for your scenario


212
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,666 line:-2
to aggregate and summarize the samples
to cut through that noise.


213
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,568 line:0
Here's a look at the data


214
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:19,540 line:0
underlying the plot Dan just showed
of Jamie's walking speed over time.


215
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:23,110 line:0
There are many samples
of walking during a day,


216
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:28,348 line:0
covering a wide range of speeds
with the occasional outlier.


217
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,219 line:-2
You've consulted the domain experts
or your data-science team,


218
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:34,888 line:-2
and they've identified
that faster walking speeds


219
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:38,859 line:-2
are the most meaningful way to understand
if someone's on track for tasks


220
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,996 line:-2
like hustling to make it across the street
before the light turns red.


221
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:47,401 line:-2
So you decide to use the 95th percentile
of the metric


222
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:52,072 line:-2
to track maximum walking speed,
without being too sensitive to outliers.


223
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:58,345 line:-2
And since this recovery process is going
to be a matter of weeks, not days,


224
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:01,582 line:-2
your product team doesn't want Jamie
to be too concerned


225
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:06,787 line:-2
about the small day-to-day fluctuations,
so you decide to average over seven days.


226
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:12,326 line:-2
But, of course, you don't want to blend
the pre- and post-injury values together,


227
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:16,363 line:-2
so you reset the calculation
after the date of injury.


228
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,966 line:-1
Now, Dan will walk through


229
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:22,369 line:-2
how to do this same calculation
directly in your app.


230
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:23,670 line:-1
Thanks, Edith.


231
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:26,440 line:-2
As you recall, we had previously queried
all of Jamie's walking speeds


232
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:29,142 line:-2
from 30 days before the injury
up to 60 days after.


233
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,880 line:-2
As Edith demonstrated,
in order to measure maximum walking speed,


234
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:37,518 line:-2
we will want to calculate and display
the top 95th-percentile speed per day.


235
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:41,054 line:-2
Let's pick midnight as the starting point
and ending point for each day.


236
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,423 line:-2
We will call enumerateDates
to iterate over each day


237
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,027 line:-2
and find all the walking speed samples
contained within.


238
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,630 line:-2
Notice that my output array
is made up of optional values.


239
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:52,566 line:-2
We cannot assume that Jamie will have
a walking speed for every single day


240
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,134 line:-1
in the range of our query.


241
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,969 line:-2
Perhaps they left their phone
on their bedside table,


242
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,839 line:-2
or maybe they just weren't
very active that day.


243
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:01,074 line:-2
But, for the days when they do have
sufficient data,


244
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:04,111 line:-2
we can calculate their 95th-percentile
walking speed.


245
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:08,415 line:-2
First, we extract all of the walking speed
samples from the HKQuantitySamples.


246
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:10,284 line:-2
Since we have been using miles per hour
in our plots,


247
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,719 line:-2
let's select that
for the values we are calculating.


248
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,955 line:-2
And just to finish it up,
let's sort the list


249
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,090 line:-2
and find the 95th-percentile
walking speed.


250
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,160 line:-2
Wow! Thanks to the analysis
of our scientists


251
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,795 line:-1
and our code implementation,


252
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,964 line:-2
Jamie can really see
the impact their injury had


253
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,366 line:-2
and how they came back
stronger and faster than before.


254
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,501 line:-1
Edith, back to you.


255
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:32,339 line:-2
Now that you've aggregated walking speed
to create a meaningful chart,


256
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:35,542 line:-2
let's talk about how to help Jamie
interpret the big picture.


257
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,979 line:-2
Filtering all that data down
to something more digestible


258
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,815 line:-1
will reveal daily and weekly progress.


259
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:45,285 line:-2
But recovery from an injury
can take a long time,


260
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,789 line:-2
and there will be other factors
that impact daily walking speeds.


261
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:52,159 line:-2
They could be health-related
like decreased pain


262
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:56,797 line:-2
or dropping off from physical therapy
or taking on a new exercise program,


263
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:58,532 line:-1
and non-health-related,


264
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:02,002 line:-2
like a brisk walking commute
that has become a morning stroll


265
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,670 line:-1
while working from home.


266
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:06,940 line:-2
Or a family vacation
that means spending several days


267
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,408 line:-1
walking with an older relative.


268
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,645 line:-2
Or maybe it's just too hot out
to walk very fast.


269
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:15,349 line:-2
Luckily, Apple's mobility metrics
go further


270
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,185 line:-1
to capture aspects of walking quality.


271
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,754 line:-1
By combining multiple metrics together,


272
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:23,257 line:-2
you can create
the whole picture of recovery.


273
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:27,561 line:-2
We have a good understanding
of how Jamie's walking speed has changed


274
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:29,830 line:-1
before and after their injury.


275
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:33,367 line:-2
Now let's take a look
at their double-support time.


276
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,103 line:-2
This is the percentage of time
during walking


277
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,705 line:-2
when both feet are in contact
with the ground,


278
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,608 line:-2
and a lower value is actually better
because it indicates


279
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:45,779 line:-2
that the walker is spending less time
using both feet to stabilize themselves.


280
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:47,414 line:-1
You can show Jamie that


281
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:50,717 line:-2
even though their walking speed
slowed down during a heat wave,


282
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,720 line:-2
when they didn't feel like going
on their brisk afternoon walk,


283
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,989 line:-1
they continued to make steady improvements


284
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,793 line:-2
in lowering their double-support time
back to pre-injury levels.


285
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:03,997 line:-2
And it doesn't stop
with this rich record of daily walking.


286
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,335 line:-2
Recall the occasional
six-minute walk tests


287
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,437 line:-1
that are done in a physical therapy clinic


288
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:13,607 line:-2
to provide snapshots
of the recovery process.


289
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:17,311 line:-2
They might not be done very often
in a busy clinic,


290
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:21,048 line:-2
and they can't tell us what
Jamie's baseline was before their injury.


291
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,484 line:-1
But because Jamie wears an Apple Watch,


292
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,955 line:-2
the movement signals from Apple Watch
and iPhone are combined


293
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:31,758 line:-2
into a predicted six-minute walk distance
each week.


294
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,427 line:-1
These values give insight


295
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,930 line:-2
into what Jamie's movement was like
before the injury,


296
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,701 line:-2
and the recovery process
in between physical therapy appointments.


297
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:45,105 line:-2
Dan, what do developers need to do
to bring in these added dimensions,


298
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,442 line:-2
like double-support time
and six-minute walk test, to the app?


299
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,245 line:-2
Let's add double-support time
and six-minute walk distance


300
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,247 line:-2
to the list of types
we would like to request.


301
00:16:53,981 --> 00:16:56,250 line:-2
We query double-support time
and six-minute walk


302
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,852 line:-2
in much the same way
as we do walking speed.


303
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:03,190 line:-2
Now is a good time to also filter the data
according to how it was collected.


304
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:04,825 line:-1
As you know, data stored in HealthKit


305
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,593 line:-2
can come from a variety
of different sources.


306
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,596 line:-2
For example, six-minute walk data
could be predicted values


307
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:14,167 line:-2
calculated on Apple Watch
or user-entered values in the Health app.


308
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,137 line:-2
For a six-minute-walk graph,
let's aggregate both the predicted values


309
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,006 line:-1
and the value Jamie had manually entered


310
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,775 line:-2
after completing
a six-minute walk test in-clinic.


311
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:24,144 line:-2
We can accomplish this
by checking the sourceRevision


312
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,980 line:-1
and metadata of the HKSample.


313
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,949 line:-2
First, we check
the source's bundleIdentifier


314
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:31,818 line:-1
to see if the data was recorded by Apple.


315
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,522 line:-2
Then, we check the metadata key
for the WasUserEntered key.


316
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,091 line:-2
If this key is both present
and set to "true,"


317
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:41,562 line:-2
then we will know that it was a sample
entered by Jamie into the HealthKit app.


318
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,131 line:-2
Otherwise, it is a predicted value
from Apple Watch.


319
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,534 line:-1
With these newly added dimensions,


320
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:51,138 line:-2
Jamie gets more than just
the walking speed plot we made earlier.


321
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:52,840 line:-2
They can see how their percentage
of double support


322
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:56,910 line:-2
increased after their injury
and steadily decreased during recovery.


323
00:17:56,977 --> 00:18:00,280 line:-2
Typically, this type of data would have
required a specialized motion lab.


324
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,783 line:-2
Now, these metrics are collected
right on their iPhone.


325
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:08,121 line:-2
Let's graph two sets of data points
for Jamie's six-minute walk distance.


326
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:11,024 line:-2
First, in red, we plot values
recorded from a test


327
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,861 line:-2
at a physical therapy clinic
and manually entered in the Health app.


328
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,832 line:-2
Second, in green, we plot predicted
six-minute-walk values


329
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,467 line:-1
generated by iPhone and Apple Watch.


330
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:24,938 line:-2
The automatic, in-system values give Jamie
a pre-injury baseline for comparison


331
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,307 line:-1
and paints a fuller picture of recovery.


332
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:28,375 line:-1
Back to Edith!


333
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,277 line:-1
Thanks, Dan!


334
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:33,814 line:-2
Developers, you've helped Jamie
own recovery from that injury


335
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:35,415 line:-1
by measuring, aggregating


336
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,818 line:-2
and interpreting changes in mobility
over time.


337
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:43,090 line:-2
In today's scenario, we've gone deep
on the powerful new mobility metrics


338
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,259 line:-1
available for iPhone and Apple Watch.


339
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:49,730 line:-2
There are already some great examples
of groups exploring mobility metrics


340
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,331 line:-1
for clinical use cases.


341
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:56,203 line:-2
The Society for Vascular Surgery
will use these mobility metrics


342
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,339 line:-2
to monitor patients
with peripheral vascular disease


343
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,708 line:-2
as they work through
a home exercise program.


344
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:07,681 line:-2
And Zimmer Biomet,
a leader in orthopedic devices and care,


345
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:09,783 line:-1
will use them in mymobility,


346
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,219 line:-2
an app that helps patients
and their doctors


347
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:15,556 line:-2
prepare for and manage
knee-replacement surgery.


348
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,792 line:-2
I want to close
with a few final pieces of advice.


349
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:25,232 line:-2
Apple devices offer rich opportunities
for motion sensing, in a variety of APIs,


350
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,301 line:-2
that round out the ways
to measure movement.


351
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:31,972 line:-2
You can access inertial sensing signals
directly on the iPhone and Apple Watch


352
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,141 line:-1
using CMMotionManager.


353
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:39,680 line:-2
You can track changes in altitude
using CMAltimeter.


354
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:44,918 line:-2
And new this year, you can now get
those same useful inertial sensor signals


355
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:49,823 line:-2
in a new location, AirPods Pro,
with the Headphone Motion API.


356
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,060 line:-2
Second, mobility metrics
have useful metadata,


357
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:56,296 line:-2
like the start and end times
for each walking bout,


358
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:00,901 line:-2
or the calibration status of a predicted
six-minute-walking-distance sample.


359
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:04,037 line:-2
So check those out when considering
how to aggregate the data.


360
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:10,511 line:-2
Next, remember that the mobility metrics
require particular conditions


361
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,746 line:-1
for measurements to be recorded.


362
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:14,314 line:-1
The iPhone values are recorded


363
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,117 line:-2
when the user carries their phone
near their waist,


364
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:21,154 line:-2
such as in a pocket,
and walks on flat ground.


365
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,958 line:-2
Six-minute walk distance is recorded
with a week of Apple Watch wear.


366
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,930 line:-1
And finally, work with domain experts


367
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:33,500 line:-2
like physical therapists, doctors,
and biomechanists


368
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,470 line:-2
to develop the strategies
for aggregating these metrics


369
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:40,107 line:-2
to find the insights and meaning
that suit your use case.


370
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,944 line:-2
There are so many health scenarios
beyond acute injury


371
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:45,913 line:-1
when movement will change.


372
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:48,348 line:-2
We're excited
for all the creative applications


373
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,217 line:-1
you find for mobility metrics,


374
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:52,386 line:-2
and we can't wait to see
what you come up with.


375
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:56,957 line:-1
Thanks for being a part of WWDC 2020.
