00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,406 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:13,614 line:0
Welcome to our WWDC talk on iOS Pickers,
Menus, and Actions.


3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,984 line:0
My name is Cas Lemmens,
and I'm a part of the Apple Design Team.


4
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:21,755 line:-2
I'm very excited to talk about
three new components we've added to iOS 14


5
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,458 line:-2
that you can use
in your iPhone and iPad apps.


6
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,593 line:0
We'll talk about menus,


7
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,229 line:0
the date and time pickers,


8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,932 line:0
and the brand-new color picker.


9
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,134 line:0
So let's start with menus.


10
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,804 line:-2
iOS 14 now allows you
to show a menu from any button,


11
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,740 line:-1
and they look like this.


12
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,142 line:-1
And you might recognize them


13
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,812 line:-2
from the actions you can add
to context menus in iOS 13.


14
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,950 line:-1
So why did we add these new menus?


15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,321 line:-2
In iOS 13, menus were presented
using an action sheet on iPhone


16
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,089 line:-1
or a popover on iPad.


17
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,995 line:-2
These components have been with us
since the very first versions of iOS,


18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,397 line:-2
and they've served us
a great amount of functionality.


19
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:09,469 line:-2
But with iPhone screens becoming larger
and iPad apps becoming richer and denser,


20
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,440 line:-2
the action sheets and popovers
started to show some disadvantages.


21
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,176 line:-2
Upon appearing,
they dimmed the background,


22
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:20,414 line:-2
which causes a heavy transition,
especially on larger screens like an iPad.


23
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,150 line:-1
The actions in the list are quite large


24
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,652 line:-2
even though the labels
are often quite short.


25
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,822 line:-1
The actions are also quite limited.


26
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,992 line:-2
For example,
I cannot use them to make a selection.


27
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,861 line:-1
And especially on the iPhone,


28
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,464 line:-2
I often have to move my finger all the way
to the other side of the screen


29
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,000 line:-1
just to choose an action or cancel out.


30
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,771 line:-2
The new menus on iOS 14
resolve a lot of these issues.


31
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:48,141 line:-2
To start, the menu appears
right next to where you tapped,


32
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:52,212 line:-2
and that requires far less movement
of your finger to select an action.


33
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,314 line:-1
The transition is very fast and light,


34
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,683 line:-1
it's shorter but it still feels smooth,


35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,753 line:-2
and it's less drastic,
as it doesn't dim the background.


36
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,290 line:-2
The items in the menu are smaller
and more concise,


37
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,025 line:-1
but still easily tappable,


38
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,895 line:-2
and they support multiple lines
for longer strings.


39
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:12,699 line:-2
And where menus in iOS 13
could only be used for actions,


40
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:16,236 line:-2
these menus can also be used
for selection and navigation,


41
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,539 line:-1
and we'll see more of that in a second.


42
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,774 line:-1
The content that can appear in a menu


43
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:24,978 line:-2
is very similar to what's already possible
for the actions in a context menu.


44
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,150 line:-2
Each action has a label on the left
and an optional icon on the right.


45
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,653 line:-2
This can be an SF Symbol
or a custom image.


46
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,155 line:-1
A title can be added


47
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,791 line:-2
to help you understand
what selection you need to make.


48
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,428 line:-2
And separators can be added
to create hierarchy.


49
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,532 line:-1
A menu can present itself from any button.


50
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,168 line:-2
For example,
the "Sort" button here in Music.


51
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,774 line:-2
To select an option,
I can tap and hold the button,


52
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,344 line:-2
move my finger down to the option
I'd like to select, and release.


53
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,381 line:-1
Alternatively, I can simply tap the button


54
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,684 line:-1
and tap the action I'd like to select.


55
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,322 line:-2
At any given time,
I can tap outside the menu to dismiss it.


56
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:12,359 line:-2
This will hide the menu
and take me back with no changes applied.


57
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,762 line:-2
It is therefore not needed
to add an additional option


58
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,297 line:-1
to your menu to cancel.


59
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,770 line:-2
Simply tapping outside the menu
has the same effect.


60
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,642 line:-2
Instead, the menu can focus
only on the actions to move forwards,


61
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,278 line:-2
which is, in this case,
choosing a sort option.


62
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,482 line:-2
The menus adhere
to the Accessibility settings


63
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,518 line:-1
available in iOS and iPad OS,


64
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,220 line:0
for example, VoiceOver, Increase Contrast,


65
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,990 line:0
Reduced Motion, and Larger Text,
as you can see here.


66
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,159 line:-1
Menus can be used in various ways.


67
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,763 line:-2
We'll talk about
the most common use cases in iOS 14:


68
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,198 line:-1
disambiguation,


69
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:52,566 line:-1
navigation,


70
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:53,867 line:-1
selection,


71
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,469 line:-1
and showing secondary options.


72
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,138 line:-1
Let's start with disambiguation.


73
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:02,075 line:-2
Menus can help you disambiguate
your choice at the right moment.


74
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,243 line:-1
In the examples we'll see,


75
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,613 line:-2
we start from a very clear action
with a clear intent,


76
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,248 line:-1
and once you select this action,


77
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,584 line:-1
a menu is shown to disambiguate.


78
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,853 line:-1
It will ask a more specific question.


79
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,022 line:-1
For example, in Photos,


80
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,457 line:-2
there's a clear "add" button
in the top left corner.


81
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:21,862 line:-2
Tapping this will show a menu
to ask you what exactly you'd like to add.


82
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:26,967 line:0
In Notes, there's a clear action
to add an image to a note.


83
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,672 line:0
Upon tapping, it will ask you
what kind of image you'd like to add.


84
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,310 line:0
And again in Photos,
when I'm editing a video,


85
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,012 line:0
there's a clear "Done" button
to save my edited video.


86
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,482 line:0
Tapping it will ask me
how I want to save it.


87
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,720 line:0
All of these are great examples
on how to use menus for disambiguation.


88
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,724 line:-1
Menus can also be used for navigation.


89
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,328 line:-2
For example, here in Safari,
I can tap and hold the "back" button


90
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,497 line:-2
to show a list of sites
I've previously visited in this session.


91
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,934 line:-2
Similarly,
the "back" button in any navigation stack


92
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,603 line:-1
brings up a similar menu.


93
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,273 line:-1
Menus can also be used for selection.


94
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,243 line:-2
For example,
here in Podcasts with the "Sort" button.


95
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,813 line:-2
Menus used for selection
receive check marks


96
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,848 line:-1
next to the items that are selected.


97
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,087 line:-2
And lastly, menus can be used to collect
a range of secondary actions.


98
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:24,858 line:-2
A simple "more" button in a view
is a great way to show a menu of actions.


99
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,128 line:-2
These actions are often
not important enough


100
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,696 line:-1
to be prominently displayed,


101
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,132 line:-1
but they still should have easy access.


102
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,268 line:-2
And they can really clean up
your design a lot


103
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,770 line:-1
and help you focus on what really matters.


104
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:41,275 line:-2
For example, here in Files,
the view focuses entirely on your content.


105
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:47,414 line:-2
In comparison, Files in iOS 13 had
many actions scattered across the view,


106
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:50,384 line:-2
and that takes attention away
from your content.


107
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,720 line:-2
So by simply collecting
and organizing them in a menu,


108
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,390 line:-1
the app becomes a lot easier to use.


109
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,962 line:-1
Similar menus appear throughout iOS 14,


110
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,931 line:-1
for example, here in Messages.


111
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,302 line:-2
Now, considering menus like this
can clean up your view,


112
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,771 line:-1
you might ask yourself, why stop there?


113
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,310 line:-2
Why not collapse all the actions
in the navigation bar into a "more" button


114
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,413 line:-2
and when you tap it,
you get a nice list of all these options?


115
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,316 line:-1
Hiding all actions in a menu


116
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,484 line:-2
is definitely not an approach
we encourage.


117
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,188 line:-2
It hides primary actions
behind an additional tap,


118
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,123 line:-2
and it doesn't give you
a good understanding


119
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,426 line:-1
of what this view can do for you.


120
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,963 line:-2
So finding the right balance
between your primary and secondary actions


121
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,833 line:-2
can help you decide
which actions can go in a menu, if any,


122
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,835 line:-1
versus which ones should stay prominent.


123
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,639 line:-2
For Messages,
we kept the ability to compose a message,


124
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:49,276 line:-2
as it's a very important and frequent
action you might want to take.


125
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,947 line:-2
Additional options don't always
have to be hidden behind a "more" button.


126
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,116 line:-2
They can also appear
on a different gesture.


127
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,151 line:-1
For example, in Safari,


128
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,822 line:-2
tapping the top right action
allows me to manage my tabs,


129
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,191 line:-1
but by tap and holding the same action,


130
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,227 line:-2
I get a range of actions
related to those tabs.


131
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,465 line:-2
One last thing to mention
regarding secondary actions


132
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,766 line:-1
are destructive actions.


133
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,702 line:-2
For example, here in Reminders,
to delete a list.


134
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,271 line:-1
As mentioned before,


135
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,872 line:-1
these new menus remove the need


136
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,874 line:-2
to move your finger
to the bottom of the screen


137
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,242 line:-1
to select an action,


138
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,878 line:-2
but sometimes,
that gesture can come in handy.


139
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,585 line:-2
Since destructive actions often cause you
to lose information you've entered,


140
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,021 line:-2
we want to make sure
there's enough friction,


141
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,589 line:-1
and throughout our different OSes,


142
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,425 line:-2
we've always done this
by asking for confirmation.


143
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,728 line:-1
To avoid accidentally deleting something,


144
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,565 line:-2
the confirmation action
needs to be in a different place


145
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,832 line:-1
than the delete action.


146
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,569 line:-2
Hence here,
when I'm tapping the delete action,


147
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,171 line:0
an action sheet appears
at the bottom of the view


148
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,706 line:0
asking for confirmation.


149
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:57,277 line:0
I will have to move my finger down
to either confirm or cancel out,


150
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,513 line:0
and the time and effort it takes to do so


151
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,517 line:0
serves as enough friction to avoid
accidentally deleting this list.


152
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,454 line:-2
Even for destructive actions
outside of a menu,


153
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,257 line:-2
we still recommend
to keep using action sheets on iPhone


154
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,892 line:-1
and popovers on iPad.


155
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,329 line:-2
In Mail,
there's friction when you cancel a draft.


156
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,398 line:-2
It will ask you whether you want to save
or delete the draft.


157
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,635 line:-1
We wouldn't want to use menus for this,


158
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,938 line:-2
since it makes it far too easy
to accidentally delete a draft.


159
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:32,279 line:-2
Instead, action sheets and popovers
require more movement of your finger


160
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,082 line:0
and help prevent
accidentally deleting a draft.


161
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,519 line:0
So just when you thought you could get rid
of all your action sheets,


162
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,220 line:0
we've still managed to keep them around.


163
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,423 line:-1
All the work we put into menus


164
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,727 line:-2
was heavily based on
how they worked on a Mac for years.


165
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:50,864 line:-2
And you'll see now that you're able to use
these menus in various similar situations,


166
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,934 line:-2
for example,
disambiguation and navigation.


167
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,772 line:-2
And so that summarizes
the menus in iOS 14.


168
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:02,876 line:-2
It replaces the action sheets on iPhone
and the popovers on iPad.


169
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,812 line:-1
You can use them for disambiguation


170
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,249 line:-2
by asking for a more specific question
via a clear action.


171
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,920 line:-2
Navigation,
by giving a list of pages to navigate to.


172
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,357 line:-2
Selection,
by giving a list to select an item from.


173
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,627 line:-2
Or showing secondary actions
via a "more" button


174
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,462 line:-1
or tap and holding an action.


175
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,033 line:0
Destructive actions
always need a confirmation,


176
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,036 line:0
and for those,
we keep using action sheets and popovers.


177
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:34,041 line:0
And the new menus will make it easier to
translate your app between iPad and Mac.


178
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,577 line:0
So that's it for menus.


179
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,179 line:0
Let's move on
to the new date and time picker.


180
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,282 line:-2
Previously, the date and time pickers
looked like this.


181
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,953 line:-2
They consisted of multiple wheels
you had to turn individually


182
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,921 line:-1
to select a date or a time.


183
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,090 line:-1
Throughout iOS 14,


184
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:53,260 line:-2
you'll notice these have been replaced
with the following new design.


185
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,495 line:-1
This is the new date picker,


186
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:56,930 line:-1
the new time picker,


187
00:09:57,531 --> 00:10:00,367 line:-2
and a new date and time picker,
which combines both.


188
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,603 line:-1
Let's look at how they work.


189
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,272 line:-1
Reminders is a great example


190
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,641 line:-2
on how to use
the new date and time picker.


191
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:11,445 line:-2
For example, here I'm adding a date
on which I would like to be reminded,


192
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:14,181 line:-2
and you can see
the new date picker being presented.


193
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,651 line:-2
Notice you have
a much better representation


194
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,520 line:-1
of the days, weeks, and months.


195
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,524 line:-2
It's easy to jump between months
by simply sliding left and right,


196
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,593 line:-2
and you can make a further jump ahead
or back in time


197
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,796 line:-2
by tapping the month
and selecting a different month and year.


198
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,400 line:-2
Reminders also allows you
to choose a specific time


199
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,002 line:-1
on which you would like to be reminded,


200
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,772 line:-2
and here as well you can see
the new time picker being presented.


201
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,275 line:-1
Instead of having to use the wheels,


202
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,944 line:-2
I can now simply type
the time of my choosing.


203
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,681 line:-2
And so the new design
makes it easier to select a date or a time


204
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,316 line:-1
with any kind of input:


205
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:52,119 line:-1
touch, pencil, keyboards, or cursor.


206
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,922 line:-2
Now, these new date and time pickers
work really well


207
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,823 line:-1
if you can show them inline in your view,


208
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,159 line:-1
for example, as Reminders does here.


209
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,861 line:-1
But that's not always possible.


210
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,730 line:-2
Specifically for those moments
where it's difficult,


211
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,633 line:-2
iOS 14 has a brand-new way
to show these pickers,


212
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,468 line:-1
which we call compact.


213
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,372 line:-2
When you ask UIKit
for a date picker in compact mode,


214
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,941 line:-1
you get a button like this.


215
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,311 line:-2
It shows a date in the key color
on top of a light platter.


216
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,113 line:-2
Tapping the button shows
the new date picker,


217
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,050 line:-2
but it's presented inside a modal
on top of the view.


218
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,119 line:-1
The same can happen for a time picker...


219
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,590 line:-1
and for a date and time picker.


220
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,161 line:-1
Let's look at an example.


221
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:36,830 line:-1
As mentioned before,


222
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:40,868 line:-2
the compact pickers are great when
it's difficult to show a picker inline.


223
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:43,704 line:-2
These buttons can appear, for example,
in rows,


224
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,741 line:-2
as you can see here in Contacts
when I'm adding a birthday to a contact.


225
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,380 line:-2
Tapping the button shows
the new date picker on top of the view,


226
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,983 line:-2
and I can change the date
as many times as I like,


227
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,887 line:-2
and once I've found the date,
I can simply tap outside to confirm.


228
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,793 line:-1
As with all of our new components,


229
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,563 line:-2
they of course adhere
to all Accessibility settings,


230
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,299 line:-2
for example, larger font sizes,
as you can see here.


231
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,638 line:-2
And the new design also creates
better parity between iPad and Mac,


232
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:20,307 line:-2
since the same information
is shown on both.


233
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:22,409 line:-1
So just as with menus,


234
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:25,612 line:-2
this will help you scale your app
between iPad and Mac.


235
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,849 line:-2
And so that wraps up
the new date and time picker.


236
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,618 line:-2
It's an improved way
to select a date or a time


237
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,921 line:-2
by giving you
a much better representation.


238
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,290 line:-1
You can use them inline in your view


239
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,659 line:-2
or use the new compact date
and time picker


240
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,562 line:-2
when showing inline is difficult
or not possible.


241
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:45,899 line:-2
And it will make it easier to translate
your app between iPad and Mac,


242
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,468 line:-2
since the same information
is shown on both.


243
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,405 line:0
So that's the new date and time picker.


244
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,240 line:0
Let's move on to the color picker.


245
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:57,845 line:-2
iOS 14 introduces
a new color picker for you to use.


246
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,214 line:-2
You can pick a color
in four different ways.


247
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,749 line:-1
You can pick it from a grid,


248
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,051 line:-1
a spectrum,


249
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,886 line:-1
by filling in an RGB value...


250
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,590 line:-1
or by selecting a color from screen.


251
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,826 line:-2
You do this by tapping the pipet
in the top left corner,


252
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,661 line:-1
after which a magnifier appears.


253
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,397 line:-2
You can drag it around
to the color you prefer,


254
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,033 line:-2
and once you release,
the color will be selected.


255
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,872 line:0
The color you select
will always appear in the bottom left.


256
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:28,842 line:0
You can also save a color to a palette,
which is accessible from any app.


257
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,313 line:-2
So the new color picker
is a great way to let you choose


258
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,915 line:-1
any color you'd like to use.


259
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,951 line:-2
For example, here,
when I'm using the pencil on iPad.


260
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,689 line:-2
And just as with menus
and date and time pickers,


261
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,759 line:-2
the new design brings parity
between iPad and Mac


262
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:49,096 line:-2
And so that's, in short,
the new color picker.


263
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,932 line:-1
It's a brand-new component in iOS 14.


264
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,268 line:-2
You can select colors
in four different ways:


265
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:59,673 line:-2
via a grid, a spectrum, an RGB value,
or picking a color from screen.


266
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:04,311 line:-2
It holds a palette of colors
that is shared across apps,


267
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:07,981 line:-2
and the new picker will help align
your app between iPad and Mac.


268
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,719 line:-2
So that wraps up
these three new components in iOS 14.


269
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,156 line:0
We added these components
to make your apps faster,


270
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,458 line:0
more lightweight, and more responsive,


271
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,362 line:0
and they provide much needed functionality
with support for accessibility


272
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,497 line:0
and localization.


273
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:26,033 line:-1
So by using these new components,


274
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:29,436 line:-2
your app will feel more native
to the iPhone and iPad,


275
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:33,040 line:-2
and it will save you a lot of time
in making sure your app is inclusive


276
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,209 line:-1
for all people all over the world.


277
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,245 line:-2
So we're very excited
for you to use them in our apps,


278
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:41,248 line:-2
and we're looking forward
to seeing them appear in yours.


279
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,483 line:-1
That's it for pickers, menus, and actions.


280
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,485 line:-2
Thank you for watching,
and until next time.
