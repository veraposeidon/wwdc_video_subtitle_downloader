1
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:07,007 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,178 line:0
Hello, and thanks for joining.
My name is Jacob.


3
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,047 line:0
I'm a program manager
for the Enterprise and Education team,


4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,449 line:0
and I'm here to talk with you


5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,285 line:0
about deploying custom apps
with Apple Business Manager.


6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,821 line:-2
Apple builds products
to enrich people's lives.


7
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,591 line:-2
This principle extends to business
and education customers as well.


8
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,494 line:-2
Custom apps can make it easy for you
to reach this audience


9
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,763 line:-2
and provide tools for them
to be productive,


10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,966 line:-2
engage with their employees and staff,
and reach their customers.


11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,036 line:-2
Whether you're a developer
considering custom apps,


12
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:39,306 line:-2
a business customer purchasing
and distributing apps to your employees,


13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,109 line:-2
or an end user who just wants to know more
about the process,


14
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,478 line:-2
I'll cover the benefits
of custom apps for you.


15
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,947 line:-2
When you see these icons
throughout the session,


16
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,950 line:-2
I'm covering a topic
of particular interest to that audience.


17
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,854 line:-2
These three groups interact with
and influence each other,


18
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,024 line:-2
so it's important to understand
how all the elements fit together.


19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,894 line:-2
This is a continual cycle, as developers
add features and sell to new customers,


20
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,997 line:-2
businesses expand and offer more apps
to their employees,


21
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:07,234 line:-2
and users transition to different roles
within the organization.


22
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,536 line:-1
First, let's do a quick review.


23
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,906 line:-2
There are multiple ways
to distribute your apps to customers.


24
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:16,543 line:-2
Enterprise app distribution allows
for customization,


25
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,812 line:-2
but is intended only
for internal deployment


26
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,681 line:-1
to your own company's employees.


27
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,651 line:-2
Historically, Enterprise app distribution
was the only approved path


28
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,053 line:-1
for internal deployment.


29
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,590 line:-2
The Custom app process includes
the benefits of TestFlight and App Review


30
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,125 line:-2
and is now the preferred path
for internal deployments


31
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,561 line:-2
in countries where Apple Business Manager
is available.


32
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,498 line:-2
Public App distribution lets you leverage
the App Store infrastructure


33
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,468 line:-2
and makes apps readily available
for your customers to purchase,


34
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,004 line:-2
but this method is intended
for a broad audience


35
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,206 line:-1
and doesn't allow for any customization.


36
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,909 line:-1
We're gonna focus on custom apps,


37
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:51,945 line:-2
which provide you as the developer
the ability to build apps


38
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,047 line:-1
with features specific to your customers


39
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,384 line:-2
while making it easier for them
to purchase and deploy the apps.


40
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,754 line:-1
Custom apps allow you the developer


41
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:04,091 line:-2
to distribute to a select customer
or group of customers.


42
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,993 line:-1
This is essentially a private App Store,


43
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,961 line:-2
where you determine the audience
who can purchase your app.


44
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,231 line:-2
It allows you
to provide specific features,


45
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,100 line:-1
branding, or other customization.


46
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,204 line:-2
Customers purchase these apps
through Apple Business Manager.


47
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,339 line:-2
They are not exposed
to the public App Store


48
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,075 line:-2
and only visible
to the organizations you allow.


49
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,446 line:-2
And now, we're excited
to extend custom apps support


50
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,749 line:-1
to Apple School Manager customers as well.


51
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,319 line:-2
I'll refer primarily to Apple Business
Manager throughout this session,


52
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,055 line:-2
but the two programs have the same support
for custom apps.


53
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,624 line:-2
Everything here that applies
to Apple Business Manager


54
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,526 line:-1
also applies to Apple School Manager.


55
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,095 line:-1
If you're a third-party developer,


56
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,565 line:-2
you can build and sell these apps
to customers.


57
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,767 line:-2
If you are part of a company
or organizational's


58
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,202 line:-1
internal development team,


59
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,471 line:-2
you can create and distribute custom apps
to your employees and staff.


60
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,607 line:-1
This extends the scope of custom apps


61
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,844 line:-2
to companies that want to develop
yourselves and deploy internally.


62
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,514 line:-2
Customers purchase a custom app
using Apple Business Manager


63
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,115 line:-1
or Apple School Manager.


64
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,684 line:-1
This is the same purchase flow


65
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,687 line:-2
as other volume licenses
of public App Store apps.


66
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,389 line:-2
The only differences
are that you as a developer


67
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,759 line:-2
explicitly allow which organizations
will see your custom apps,


68
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,128 line:-2
and custom apps show up
in a separate collection


69
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,597 line:-1
in Apple Business Manager.


70
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,301 line:-2
After purchase,
customers manage licenses and distribution


71
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,537 line:-1
the same as other volume-purchased apps.


72
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,507 line:-2
Connect an MDM server
to Apple Business Manager


73
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,443 line:-2
for license distribution
and other management tasks.


74
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,046 line:-2
This connection allows MDM
to manage devices


75
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,815 line:-1
on behalf of the organization.


76
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,718 line:-2
Once the license is distributed
to the device,


77
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,787 line:-2
the device downloads the custom app
from the App Store infrastructure.


78
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,657 line:-1
Custom apps represent a private App Store.


79
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:47,928 line:-2
You authorize organizations or specific
purchasers who can buy your apps,


80
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,497 line:-2
and those apps only show up
for those customers.


81
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,567 line:-1
So zooming in a bit,


82
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,637 line:-2
we're gonna focus on how
this process works for the developer.


83
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,306 line:-2
There are advantages to you
as a developer:


84
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:03,010 line:-2
private distribution of a custom-built app
to the customers you specify.


85
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,846 line:-2
You can create apps
with the features and functions


86
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,148 line:-2
that might not be relevant
for the general public,


87
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,684 line:-2
and provide these apps exclusively
to your customers.


88
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,055 line:-2
You are able to provide custom features
for your audience


89
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,958 line:-2
while leveraging the App Store
infrastructure for distribution.


90
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,195 line:-2
And because your apps go through
the same app review process,


91
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,199 line:-2
you get feedback from Apple and confidence
that your app meets our quality standards.


92
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:30,237 line:-2
You get access to App Store Connect tools
for submitting your app,


93
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,941 line:-2
viewing app analytics and crash logs,
and managing payment and pricing.


94
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,778 line:-2
Apple takes care of payment processing,
taxes, and other overhead.


95
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,746 line:-2
And if you're currently using
App Store Connect,


96
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,317 line:-2
the process for submitting apps and using
these tools is already familiar to you.


97
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,887 line:-2
Another important benefit
with App Store Connect


98
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,123 line:-2
is the ability to use TestFlight
for beta testing with select users.


99
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,427 line:-2
You can send invitations via e-mail
or a public link


100
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,097 line:-2
and collect feedback before launching
your app for general availability.


101
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,100 line:-2
If you're developing apps
for internal use,


102
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,437 line:-2
you can also distribute internally
to your employees and associates.


103
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,738 line:-1
This is a big improvement


104
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,542 line:-2
because it greatly simplifies the process
of getting your apps to your staff.


105
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,845 line:0
And because these apps come
from the App Store,


106
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,081 line:0
the distribution certificates
don't expire.


107
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,549 line:-1
This is an important distinction


108
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,519 line:-2
for developers who are familiar
with Enterprise distribution


109
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,756 line:-2
and the requirements to renew distribution
certificates on a regular basis.


110
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,559 line:-2
With custom apps, you can focus
on enhancements and features


111
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,529 line:-2
for new versions of your app,
not certificate management.


112
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,497 line:-1
It all starts with inspiration.


113
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:34,067 line:-2
You have a great idea for a custom app,
or a customer has reached out to you


114
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:37,237 line:-2
and wants you to modify
an existing App Store app for them.


115
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:41,041 line:-2
Let's say this developer has a popular app
called Forest Explorer


116
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,277 line:-1
for exploring parks and open spaces,


117
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,213 line:-2
and a business contacts them
and wants a custom version


118
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,715 line:-2
to help their employees navigate
the corporate campus


119
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,350 line:-1
and find local green spaces.


120
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,920 line:-2
We'll call this custom app
Campus Explorer.


121
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,590 line:-2
The first thing you need to do
is get your team together.


122
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,959 line:-1
Enroll in developer programs if necessary.


123
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,396 line:-2
If you already have an account, great.
You're ahead of the game.


124
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,965 line:-2
Use the same
Organization Developer program


125
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,801 line:-2
that you do for the apps you publish
to the App Store.


126
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,636 line:-1
If you're setting up a new program,


127
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,439 line:-2
be aware that you need
an Organization Developer program,


128
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,274 line:-1
and this requires a DUNS number.


129
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,811 line:-2
If you charge for your app, you'll also
need to provide banking information


130
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,913 line:-1
and accept the paid apps agreement.


131
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,950 line:-2
If you are an internal development team,
the same rules apply.


132
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,453 line:-2
Get added to your company's
existing developer program,


133
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,222 line:-1
invite third-party contributors...


134
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:32,392 line:-2
If you're the account holder or admin
for your developer program


135
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,428 line:-1
and want to include external developers,


136
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,997 line:-2
grant them access to the apps
they are working on


137
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,967 line:-2
and maintain control
of the app submission process yourself.


138
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,135 line:-1
Once you're enrolled,


139
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:45,639 line:-2
App Store Connect is where you manage
aspects of your developer account,


140
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,808 line:-2
including inviting new members
to your team,


141
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,510 line:-1
signing necessary agreements,


142
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,412 line:-2
providing payment information,
and submitting your app.


143
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,982 line:-1
Let's go through this together.


144
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,350 line:-1
Under Users and Access,


145
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,119 line:-2
we can see everyone associated
with our developer account


146
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,088 line:-1
and their roles and app privileges.


147
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,023 line:-1
For this project,


148
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,326 line:-2
we're going to hire a contracted developer
to help with some of the work.


149
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,830 line:-1
We're adding Lucinda Yang as a developer


150
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,833 line:-2
with access only
to the Campus Explorer app.


151
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,168 line:-1
When we select invite,


152
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,471 line:-2
Lucinda will get an invitation
to join our developer account.


153
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,041 line:-2
Once we have our team together
and our app is ready to go,


154
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:25,045 line:-2
the next step is to submit it for review
and distribution in App Store Connect.


155
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:29,116 line:-2
Provide metadata for your app,
like screen shots, description,


156
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:30,984 line:-1
keywords, and other information.


157
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,821 line:-2
Set the price and regions
where your app will be available.


158
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,291 line:-2
We recommend making your app
available globally,


159
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,160 line:-2
because this allows you
to reach the broadest possible audience.


160
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,564 line:-2
This is also the point
where you'll choose the distribution type:


161
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,966 line:-1
available as a public app on the App Store


162
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,069 line:-2
or available for specific business
and education customers.


163
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:53,807 line:0
For more information, refer to the
"What's New in App Store Connect" session.


164
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,444 line:-2
Okay, so we're ready to submit
our custom app.


165
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:01,348 line:-2
First, we create a new app entry
by selecting the "plus" icon.


166
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:08,121 line:-2
Then we provide the name, app preview,
screen shots, and other metadata.


167
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,858 line:-1
We set a price for our app,


168
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,695 line:-2
select the countries or regions where
our app will be available for purchase...


169
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,699 line:-2
and we provide the org details
for our customer, Pretendco,


170
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,501 line:-1
which will allow them to purchase our app


171
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,603 line:-2
from their
Apple Business Manager instance.


172
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,572 line:-1
We're almost ready to submit our app.


173
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,342 line:-2
Our app requires sign-in
using a corporate account,


174
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,244 line:-1
so we're providing a demo credential


175
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,679 line:-2
that will help the App Review team
access the app.


176
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,149 line:-2
We're also providing notes
with additional details,


177
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:39,553 line:-2
and we have the option to submit
screen shots or other attachments.


178
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,322 line:-2
When we're ready,
we submit the app for review.


179
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:44,791 line:-1
And here's our app,


180
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,494 line:-2
back from review and ready
for customers to purchase.


181
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,931 line:-2
App Review gives you direct feedback
from our review team


182
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,934 line:-2
and gives your customers the confidence
that your app has been vetted


183
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,369 line:-1
and approved by Apple.


184
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,872 line:-2
While Custom App Review differs slightly
from public apps,


185
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,808 line:-2
to make sure your app goes through
this process smoothly,


186
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,946 line:-2
provide a demo account and credentials
if your app requires authentication.


187
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:09,550 line:-2
This demo account should be able to access
all the functions of your app.


188
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:13,086 line:-2
Or you could build a demo mode
into your app and supply sample data.


189
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,790 line:-2
The intent is to make sure the review team
is able to inspect all the functionality


190
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,225 line:-1
and features of your app.


191
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:23,130 line:-2
Submit good metadata, such as description,
keywords and screen shots


192
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:24,865 line:-1
that show details about your app.


193
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:28,135 line:-2
If you're providing your app
to a specific audience or market segment,


194
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:29,970 line:-1
describe it in the notes review.


195
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,774 line:-2
The more details the App Review team has
about your app,


196
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,142 line:-1
the easier the process will go,


197
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,411 line:-2
especially if this is your first time
submitting an app.


198
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,179 line:-1
If you're updating an existing app,


199
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,949 line:-2
provide details about the new enhancements
and features.


200
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,851 line:-1
If the update is a maintenance release,


201
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,254 line:-2
add notes with specific information
about what is fixed in the new version


202
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,989 line:-1
beyond just "bug fixes."


203
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:53,627 line:-2
Make sure you account for App Review time
when planning your deployment schedule.


204
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:56,396 line:-2
Also, be aware of times
when there is increased traffic,


205
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,131 line:-1
such as holidays and product launches,


206
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,634 line:-2
when it might take longer
to get through the process.


207
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,705 line:-2
And be mindful of deadlines when your app
is required to support the latest SDKs.


208
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,141 line:-1
Use only public APIs,


209
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,011 line:-2
and make sure your app runs
on the currently shipping OS.


210
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,847 line:-2
This is covered in the guidelines,
but it's worth a call-out here.


211
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:17,518 line:-2
Using documented APIs
and phasing out deprecated frameworks


212
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,354 line:-2
ensures your app is stable
and continues to function.


213
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,790 line:-2
Apple changes and modifies private APIs
without advance notice.


214
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:26,994 line:-2
If your app relies on these,
it could stop working


215
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,329 line:-2
or cause unexpected issues
for your end users.


216
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,832 line:-2
If your app requires
additional entitlements


217
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,901 line:-1
for hardware resources or user data,


218
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,136 line:-2
make sure you adhere
to Apple's privacy guidelines


219
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,038 line:-1
for collecting and storing user data.


220
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,806 line:-1
Refer to the privacy and legal section


221
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:43,110 line:-2
in the App Store Review Guidelines
and developer documentation.


222
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,612 line:-1
As you expand your customer base,


223
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,414 line:-2
you might create a new instance
of your app--


224
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,584 line:-2
for example, if you're selling
to a new customer or market segment


225
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:54,288 line:-2
or selling your app in a new region
with different regulatory requirements.


226
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,758 line:-2
If possible,
keep these variations to a minimum.


227
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,895 line:-2
This avoids the complexity of managing
separate build trains and release cycles.


228
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:05,399 line:-2
If you need to provide specific branding
or other minor modification,


229
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,000 line:-1
use App Configuration


230
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,971 line:-2
or rules based on user authorization
to deliver this content.


231
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:12,639 line:-1
All customers get the same app,


232
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,642 line:-2
but you can fine-tune the experience
based on these settings.


233
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,612 line:-2
If you do need to create
a completely new app,


234
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,380 line:-1
collect common code into frameworks


235
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,916 line:-2
so you can reuse it
across your different apps.


236
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,920 line:-2
If you're creating a new app,
each instance requires a new Bundle ID,


237
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,156 line:-2
a new submission,
and a separate App Review,


238
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:32,059 line:-2
and you'll need to maintain these
as separate build trains.


239
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,162 line:-2
Your development and release cycle
will be different


240
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:37,364 line:-2
than the deployment cycles
for your customers.


241
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,266 line:-2
It's important to take this
into consideration


242
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,034 line:-1
when planning major releases.


243
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:44,104 line:-1
Here, you release Version 1.1


244
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,740 line:-2
in the middle
of your customer's deployment wave one.


245
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,843 line:-2
This means that half the employees
will be on Version 1 of the app,


246
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,513 line:-2
but devices that go out to employees
after this date


247
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,048 line:-1
will have a Version 1.1 installed.


248
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,651 line:-2
There are ways to mitigate this
with MDM commands,


249
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,686 line:-1
but it's best to coordinate ahead of time,


250
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:03,891 line:-2
especially when planning around
new product launches or OS releases.


251
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,660 line:-2
Once you publish a new version
of your app,


252
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,229 line:-2
your customers cannot deploy
the previous version.


253
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:13,700 line:-2
This process usually goes smoothly.
But if you do run into problems,


254
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:17,070 line:-2
make sure your customers have enabled
custom apps in Apple School Manager


255
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,739 line:-1
and Apple Business Manager.


256
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:23,010 line:-2
The org name and org ID you specify
in App Store Connect must match exactly,


257
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,578 line:-1
including punctuation.


258
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:27,347 line:-1
Apps can take time to show up as available


259
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,616 line:-2
on a customer's
Apple Business Manager org.


260
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:32,519 line:-2
If you authorize a new customer
to purchase an existing app,


261
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,955 line:-2
allow up to 24 hours
before that app shows up


262
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,090 line:-1
in their Apple Business Manager instance.


263
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,461 line:-2
If you're modifying a consumer app
for a business customer,


264
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:44,598 line:-2
you need to create a new Bundle ID
and submit it as a new app.


265
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:49,002 line:-2
You can't convert an existing consumer app
into a custom app or vice versa.


266
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,339 line:-2
If you do run into problems,
we're here to help.


267
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:55,442 line:-2
Contact the App Review team
using your developer account


268
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,211 line:-1
for issues like appealing a rejection


269
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,080 line:-2
or providing additional information
about your submission.


270
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,549 line:-2
You can submit
a Developer Technical Support case


271
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,384 line:-1
for code-level technical assistance,


272
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,287 line:-2
and your customers can contact AppleCare
if they experience issues


273
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,922 line:-1
purchasing or deploying your app.


274
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:12,593 line:-2
Now we're gonna transition
from our development track


275
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,129 line:-2
and go back to our app life cycle
and focus on what this looks like


276
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,265 line:-2
from the perspective
of a business buying the app.


277
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,169 line:-2
For the administrators managing devices
and deploying apps to your employees,


278
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,470 line:-1
this is your section.


279
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,407 line:-2
Custom apps give you the benefit
of deploying and managing apps


280
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,676 line:-2
like you're doing right now
with volume-purchased apps


281
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,345 line:-1
through Apple Business Manager.


282
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:35,015 line:-2
You purchase and manage licenses
the same way you would for other content.


283
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:39,486 line:-2
IT teams can leverage the same
distribution model as App Store apps,


284
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:43,290 line:-2
including device-based assignment
and managed-app capabilities.


285
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:44,958 line:-1
You can assign, revoke,


286
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,528 line:-2
and reassign licenses
as your needs change.


287
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,697 line:-2
Since the custom app
has gone through App Review screening,


288
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:54,501 line:-2
you can be confident that it meets
Apple's quality and security guidelines.


289
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:57,070 line:-1
And you can work with the developer


290
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,373 line:-2
to provide the level
of customization you need,


291
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,309 line:-2
such as security features
for sensitive corporate data,


292
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:05,712 line:-2
company branding, or specific
functionality for your workflows.


293
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:09,850 line:-2
Apple Business Manager is the service
that makes this all possible.


294
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,586 line:-2
There are three main functions
of Apple Business Manager:


295
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:16,323 line:-2
deploying and managing devices,
purchasing and assigning content,


296
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,258 line:-1
and managing accounts and privileges.


297
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:22,496 line:-2
Apple Business Manager makes it easy
to deploy devices at scale


298
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:24,331 line:-1
using automated device enrollment


299
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:27,367 line:-2
and configure them
with your security policies and content.


300
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,270 line:-2
You can automatically enroll
organization-owned devices


301
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:34,741 line:-2
into your MDM solution without having
to prep each device individually.


302
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,710 line:-1
You can simplify the setup process


303
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,246 line:-2
by removing specific steps
in Setup Assistant


304
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:41,181 line:-1
so users are up and running quickly.


305
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,985 line:-2
You can delegate privileges
for certain functionality,


306
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,120 line:-1
like managing devices or content.


307
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,022 line:-1
And with Federated Authentication,


308
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,458 line:-2
it's easy to use
existing corporate credentials


309
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,294 line:-2
to reduce the number of accounts
employees need to maintain


310
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,530 line:-1
and to give IT a central point of control.


311
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:00,300 line:-1
Last year, we introduced User Enrollment


312
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:03,337 line:-2
as an option for organizations
who want to enable their employees


313
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,605 line:-1
to use their own device


314
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,908 line:-2
while giving the corporate IT organization
lightweight control.


315
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:12,279 line:-2
Companies can provide custom apps
and other managed content to the device.


316
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,016 line:0
Check out the "What's New
in Managing Apple Devices" session


317
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,451 line:0
for the latest updates.


318
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,022 line:-2
Okay, let's set up Apple Business Manager
together.


319
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,557 line:-1
As an IT administrator,


320
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:27,561 line:-2
the first thing you need to do to support
custom apps is enable it under Settings.


321
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:31,932 line:-2
You also need to provide
your organization details to the developer


322
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,401 line:-2
so they can authorize you
to purchase the app.


323
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:38,872 line:-2
This name and ID must match exactly as
it's displayed in Apple Business Manager.


324
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,875 line:-2
Mobile device management is required
to make this all work.


325
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:46,380 line:-2
You purchase content, manage locations,
and assign devices to MDM servers


326
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,814 line:-1
in Apple Business Manager.


327
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:51,185 line:-2
MDM does the heavy lifting
of assigning and revoking licenses


328
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,353 line:-1
as well as ongoing device management.


329
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,590 line:-2
So now,
we'll configure the connection between


330
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:59,860 line:-2
our Apple Business Manager instance
and our MDM server.


331
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:02,563 line:-1
First, we'll add a new MDM server.


332
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,500 line:-2
We're using Profile Manager,
Apple's reference MDM.


333
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:09,536 line:-2
In Profile Manager,
we've generated a public key,


334
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:10,904 line:-1
which we upload here.


335
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,641 line:-2
Then we download
the Device Enrollment token


336
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,476 line:-1
and upload it to Profile Manager.


337
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,445 line:-1
This creates the trust connection.


338
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:20,948 line:-2
And now we can see that our devices
have been assigned


339
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,850 line:-1
and are managed by Profile Manager.


340
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,954 line:-2
Next, we download the location token
for apps and books


341
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,755 line:-1
and save it to Profile Manager.


342
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,891 line:-1
This allow license distribution.


343
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,927 line:-2
In addition to license management
for volume-purchased content,


344
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,096 line:-1
MDM handles management functions


345
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,032 line:-2
like enforcing policies
to manage app updates centrally,


346
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,735 line:-2
and restrict employees
from updating apps on their own.


347
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,438 line:-2
This is useful
if you want to keep employees


348
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:48,375 line:-2
on a specific version of an app until
you're ready to update to the new version.


349
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:52,012 line:-2
Custom apps adhere to the same rules
as managed apps,


350
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,780 line:-1
so you can remove a license,


351
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:58,619 line:-2
push a new license to a deployed device,
or initiate an update to a deployed app


352
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:04,892 line:-2
and enforce a policy to defer OS updates
for up to 90 days after release.


353
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,194 line:-2
For more information, refer to
the Mobile Device Management Settings


354
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:10,531 line:-1
for IT Administrators documentation.


355
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,800 line:-2
Going back to Apple Business Manager,
last step:


356
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,569 line:-1
We'll purchase the custom app now


357
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,571 line:-1
and assign it to a location.


358
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:24,077 line:-2
Then, MDM will be able to assign
that license to end users and devices.


359
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,046 line:-1
Administrators can create separate groups


360
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,348 line:-2
in Apple Business Manager
called Locations,


361
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,384 line:-2
and use these to delegate
license management


362
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,086 line:-1
to specific users in their organization.


363
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,656 line:-1
If you have regional offices, for example,


364
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,559 line:-2
you can purchase licenses
from the main corporate location,


365
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,328 line:-2
then assign them to each regional office
to manage on their own.


366
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,899 line:-2
If you're migrating from the legacy
volume purchase program,


367
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,135 line:-2
Apple Business Manager
and Apple School Manager


368
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:50,838 line:-2
provide better flexibility
for managing licenses.


369
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:52,539 line:-1
You'll need to plan your migration


370
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:55,876 line:-2
to ensure deployed apps continue to work
without an interruption.


371
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,712 line:-2
See the support article
on Migrating to Apps and Books


372
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,047 line:-1
for more information.


373
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,449 line:-2
And as a reminder,
the volume-purchase program


374
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:05,619 line:-2
will no longer be available
starting December 1, 2020.


375
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,456 line:-1
If you need to keep users from updating,


376
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:14,795 line:-2
use MDM restrictions to allow IT control
over initiating app updates.


377
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:17,164 line:-2
And like other
managed license distribution,


378
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:20,133 line:-1
you can assign apps to device or to users.


379
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,538 line:-2
If you're new to Apple Business Manager
and just getting started,


380
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:28,175 line:-2
make sure your MDM solution
supports these features for managed apps.


381
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:32,312 line:-2
Custom app support allows the MDM
to manage licenses for custom apps.


382
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,615 line:-2
If you want to manage
app updates centrally,


383
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,351 line:-2
restrict end users from updating the app
on their own...


384
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:40,687 line:-2
and initiate the app update
when you're ready to update


385
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,323 line:-2
the entire organization
to the new version.


386
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:46,026 line:-2
Deferring OS updates
can be a good technique


387
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:48,529 line:-2
for keeping your devices
on the previous version of the OS


388
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,631 line:-1
for compatibility or other reasons.


389
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,700 line:-2
OS updates can be deferred
for up to 90 days.


390
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:56,003 line:-1
Wrapping up for the business segment,


391
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,505 line:-1
and finally, our app life cycle,


392
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:00,507 line:-1
we'll look at the end-user perspective.


393
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,911 line:-2
As an end user,
you get the benefits of using an app


394
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,547 line:-2
that's been designed
to fit your specific needs.


395
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,715 line:-2
When activating your device
for the first time,


396
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,218 line:-1
MDM takes over initial configuration


397
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:13,720 line:-2
and allows you to skip through
the setup process.


398
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,589 line:-1
Your apps are automatically installed,


399
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:19,927 line:-2
and company accounts like Mail and network
access are configured automatically.


400
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:23,030 line:-1
Your company can publish an App Catalog


401
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:26,333 line:-2
to make it easy to discover other optional
or recommended apps,


402
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,969 line:-2
including other managed apps
or App Store apps.


403
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:32,940 line:-2
And iCloud can help keep data in sync
across multiple devices


404
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,776 line:-2
while giving IT the ability
to restrict content


405
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,679 line:-2
flowing from managed sources
to unmanaged sources.


406
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:41,014 line:-1
As an end user,


407
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:45,118 line:-2
we'll take the device out of the box
and activate it for the first time.


408
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:47,487 line:-1
We'll start the Setup Assistant,


409
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:51,692 line:-2
choose a location, language,
and a Wi-Fi network.


410
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:57,497 line:-2
And we'll see that our organization
is managing our device for us


411
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,766 line:-1
to skip the rest of the setup process,


412
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,903 line:-2
and our custom app is automatically
installed on the device,


413
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,271 line:-1
and we're ready to go.


414
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,207 line:-1
Last step: back to our cycle.


415
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,877 line:-1
This is a continuous process.


416
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,980 line:-2
As end users or organizations
have enhancement requests


417
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,483 line:-2
and new feature ideas,
they communicate those to the developer.


418
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,318 line:-1
The developer releases new versions


419
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,787 line:-2
and enables more customers
to purchase their app.


420
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:22,990 line:-1
Let's do a quick recap.


421
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,459 line:-2
As a developer,
custom apps are a great way


422
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,628 line:-2
for you to reach business
and education customers


423
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,864 line:-2
and provide them an easy way
to distribute apps for their employees,


424
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,299 line:-1
staff and students.


425
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:36,904 line:-2
Businesses can benefit
from easy deployment using existing tools,


426
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,873 line:-2
and they can get apps
with specific features built for them.


427
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:44,311 line:-2
Internal teams can use custom apps
to easily deploy to their employees,


428
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:46,914 line:-2
and Apple Business Manager
and Apple School Manager


429
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,515 line:-1
make all this possible.


430
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:52,352 line:-2
Thank you for your time,
and enjoy the rest of WWDC.
