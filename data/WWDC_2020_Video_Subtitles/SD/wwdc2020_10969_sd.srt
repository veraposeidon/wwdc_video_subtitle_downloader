>> DANA: I painted
this one last -


2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,366 line:79% position:50% size:48%
>> SPEAKER: I can't
watch anymore TV.


3
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,566 line:79% position:50% size:63%
>> JO: If you don't think
that the toilet paper


4
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:15,933 line:79% position:50% size:65%
industry started this,
then you're f*****g crazy.


5
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,000 line:85% position:50% size:40%
>> POPPY: Hello.


6
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:23,600 line:79% position:50% size:48%
>> IAN: There
she is. Hey, Poppy.


7
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,866 line:85% position:50% size:43%
I waited for you.


8
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:26,433 line:79% position:50% size:53%
I waited for you this
time in the meeting.


9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,533 line:85% position:50% size:63%
>> POPPY: Nice one, mate.


10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,433 line:79% position:50% size:68%
>> IAN: Looks like somebody
did find that shower.


11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,833 line:79% position:50% size:45%
>> POPPY: I wanted
to look fancy.


12
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,033 line:79% position:50% size:38%
>> IAN: Did you
wash your hair?


13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,766 line:79% position:50% size:40%
>> POPPY: Yes, I
washed my hair.


14
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,799 line:79% position:50% size:58%
>> IAN: All right.
I'll keep my eye on it.


15
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,166 line:79% position:50% size:53%
>> POPPY: Okay. Okay.
Alright, alright.


16
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:39,433 line:85% position:50% size:73%
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Fine.


17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,766 line:79% position:50% size:38%
You know what I
actually did -


18
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,100 line:85% position:50% size:63%
>> LOU: Guys? G*d d***it.


19
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,000 line:85% position:50% size:78%
Guys. F**k. Good. There. Jesus.


20
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:48,233 line:79% position:50% size:75%
Now, remember, this only works
if we all do our part, okay?


21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,866 line:79% position:50% size:65%
We get one shot at this so
don't f**k it up, Rachel.


22
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:53,933 line:85% position:50% size:50%
No one can hear you.


23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600 line:85% position:50% size:35%
It's paradise.


24
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,666 line:85% position:50% size:25%
All right.


25
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,533 line:79% position:50% size:60%
It looks like we're
ready at CW but Brad has


26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,399 line:85% position:50% size:53%
a quick announcement.


27
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,133 line:85% position:50% size:38%
Whatever. Fine.


28
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,033 line:85% position:50% size:23%
Brad, go.


29
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,966 line:79% position:50% size:38%
>> BRAD: Yeah.
Hey, everybody.


30
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:04,200 line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, I had this bet with
David and well, he totally


31
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,799 line:79% position:50% size:63%
sandbagged and lost on
purpose, but then we made


32
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,866 line:79% position:50% size:70%
the stakes really high and
we played one final time and


33
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:14,233 line:85% position:50% size:68%
well, I still beat his a**.


34
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,566 line:85% position:50% size:55%
>> SPEAKER: Oh. David.


35
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:18,533 line:79% position:50% size:45%
>> SPEAKER: David,
is that you?


36
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,466 line:85% position:50% size:60%
>> DANA: You look weird.


37
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,366 line:79% position:50% size:43%
>> SPEAKER: You
look like an egg.


38
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:21,299 line:79% position:50% size:45%
>> DAVID: I know I
look weird, okay.


39
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:22,400 line:79% position:50% size:48%
>> SUE: You look
like a baby turtle.


40
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:23,566 line:79% position:50% size:55%
>> LOU: Wait, is that
David or Sandy Duncan?


41
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,099 line:79% position:50% size:60%
>> DAVID: But it'll grow
back in like eight or


42
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,000 line:85% position:50% size:28%
ten months.


43
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:26,700 line:85% position:50% size:33%
I don't know.


44
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:27,900 line:79% position:50% size:53%
Has anyone ever
shaved their eyebrow?


45
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:28,933 line:79% position:50% size:40%
I don't know how
long that takes.


46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,799 line:85% position:50% size:45%
Does it grow back?


47
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:30,599 line:85% position:50% size:23%
Whatever.


48
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,433 line:85% position:50% size:45%
It doesn't matter.


49
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,799 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I just - I feel bad that
I lost the $300,000


50
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:34,666 line:85% position:50% size:30%
for charity.


51
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:35,633 line:79% position:50% size:45%
>> BRAD: I already
donated it.


52
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,866 line:85% position:50% size:38%
>> DAVID: What?


53
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,066 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> BRAD: Yeah, I was
always going to donate it.


54
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:38,933 line:85% position:50% size:38%
>> DAVID: What?


55
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,833 line:85% position:50% size:60%
>> BRAD: Ian doubled it.


56
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,500 line:85% position:50% size:28%
>> IAN: Yo.


57
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,066 line:85% position:50% size:45%
>> DAVID: But why?


58
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:44,133 line:79% position:50% size:65%
I thought you were opposed
to giving away money?


59
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,933 line:85% position:50% size:50%
>> BRAD: No, no, no.


60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,900 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I told you I need to get
something out of it


61
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,200 line:85% position:50% size:30%
which I did.


62
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:49,633 line:85% position:50% size:33%
Your dignity.


63
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,666 line:85% position:50% size:70%
That's $600,000 for charity.


64
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:52,799 line:85% position:50% size:43%
Way to go, David.


65
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:54,700 line:79% position:50% size:38%
>> SPEAKER: Way
to go, David.


66
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:55,900 line:85% position:50% size:70%
>> SPEAKER: Good job, David.


67
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,000 line:85% position:50% size:58%
>> DAVID: Thanks, guys.


68
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,233 line:79% position:50% size:45%
>> SPEAKER: It all
worked out, right?


69
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,266 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> RACHEL: Actually, since
we're all here, I think it


70
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,799 line:85% position:50% size:63%
would be really nice to -


71
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:03,766 line:85% position:50% size:40%
>> LOU: Oh, God.


72
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,433 line:79% position:50% size:55%
Here comes some boring
SJW rant about -


73
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,799 line:79% position:50% size:63%
>> RACHEL: You know what?
F**k you, Lou, okay.


74
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:08,333 line:85% position:50% size:63%
You're being such a d**k.


75
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,032 line:85% position:50% size:23%
Oh, s**t.


76
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:09,800 line:85% position:50% size:53%
I think I started it.


77
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:10,598 line:85% position:50% size:48%
>> IAN: Wait, what?


78
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,033 line:79% position:50% size:48%
>> LOU: Go.
Go, go, go, go, go.


79
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,933 line:85% position:50% size:58%
Oh, s**t. It's working.


80
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,300 line:85% position:50% size:65%
>> DANA: Wait, where's CW?


81
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:55,966 line:85% position:50% size:60%
>> SPEAKER: Where is he?


82
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:56,733 line:85% position:50% size:63%
>> RACHEL: Come on, dude.


83
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,933 line:85% position:50% size:63%
>> BRAD: C-dubs. Come on.


84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,133 line:85% position:50% size:53%
>> IAN: Come on, man.


85
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,400 line:85% position:50% size:48%
>> JO: Where is he?


86
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:03,599 line:85% position:50% size:50%
>> POPPY: Oh my God.


87
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,766 line:85% position:50% size:40%
>> IAN: Come on.


88

00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:13,900 line:85% position:50% size:30%
>> LOU: Yes.


91
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:15,800 line:85% position:50% size:43%
>> CW: I made it.


92
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:18,066 line:79% position:50% size:48%
>> SPEAKER: C-dubs,
you the man.


93
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,433 line:79% position:50% size:40%
>> CW: F**k you,
coronavirus.


94
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,000 line:79% position:50% size:53%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY:
Hey there, everybody.


95
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,666 line:79% position:50% size:68%
Thank you for having a few
of us from the Mythic Quest

102
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,333 line:79% position:50% size:60%
Okay. Let's jump in with
the first question.


103
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,800 line:79% position:50% size:58%
This comes from Michael
from Phoenix, Arizona.


104
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:20,132 line:79% position:50% size:70%
Michael says Mythic Quest is
absolutely my favorite show.


105
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,399 line:85% position:50% size:53%
That's a great start.


106
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:23,199 line:79% position:50% size:53%
That's a great start
to this entire thing.


107
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:24,266 line:79% position:50% size:48%
>> BRAD: I'm loving
this question.


108
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,166 line:79% position:50% size:63%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Mythic
Quest is absolutely my


109
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,433 line:79% position:50% size:60%
favorite show
centered on development.


110
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,333 line:85% position:50% size:45%
>> MEGAN GANZ: Oh.


111
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,733 line:79% position:50% size:63%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: That
seems a little bit more -


112
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,833 line:85% position:50% size:30%
that seems -


113
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:31,633 line:79% position:50% size:48%
>> MEGAN GANZ:
We're the only one.


114
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:32,733 line:85% position:50% size:58%
We're the only one, so.


115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,766 line:79% position:50% size:50%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY:
Fine. We'll take it.


116
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,033 line:85% position:50% size:58%
Michael, we'll take it.


117
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,433 line:85% position:50% size:63%
It feels so true to life.


118
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,800 line:79% position:50% size:68%
I'm curious how many
consultants you worked with


119
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,666 line:85% position:50% size:60%
on creating the scripts?


120
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:41,833 line:85% position:50% size:68%
Meg, you want to take that?


121
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:42,733 line:85% position:50% size:50%
>> MEGAN GANZ: Yeah.


122
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,733 line:79% position:50% size:70%
Well, our first and
foremost, like, our partners


123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,300 line:85% position:50% size:70%
in Mythic Quest are Ubisoft.


124
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:50,466 line:79% position:50% size:60%
So, we had constant
communication with them.


125
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,333 line:79% position:50% size:53%
They were in the
writers room with us.


126
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,500 line:79% position:50% size:68%
They were guiding the whole
process, letting us know -


127
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,066 line:85% position:50% size:70%
introducing us to the world.


128
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:01,266 line:79% position:50% size:70%
On top of that, they also
facilitated people from many


129
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,066 line:79% position:50% size:48%
different studios
coming to visit us.


130
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,633 line:85% position:50% size:48%
We had programmers.


131
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,399 line:79% position:50% size:50%
We had a
monetization expert.


132
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:08,000 line:85% position:50% size:38%
We had writers.


133
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:10,533 line:79% position:50% size:60%
We had all sorts of
different people come in


134
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,766 line:85% position:50% size:38%
and talk to us.


135
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,966 line:79% position:50% size:68%
My favorite of all of those
people was the first female


136
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:18,766 line:79% position:50% size:68%
coder we spoke with who was
just as surly as I wanted


137
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,733 line:85% position:50% size:25%
her to be.


138
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,133 line:79% position:50% size:68%
She was suffering no fools
and not mincing words about


139
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,399 line:79% position:50% size:55%
her experience and I
absolutely loved every


140
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:28,500 line:85% position:50% size:63%
second of talking to her.


141
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:30,100 line:79% position:50% size:68%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: That was
a really fun experience


142
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,433 line:79% position:50% size:45%
because she
seemed very upset.


143
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,199 line:85% position:50% size:50%
>> MEGAN GANZ: Yeah.


144
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,166 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: She was
very upset, I think mostly


145
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:39,366 line:79% position:50% size:70%
by the portrayal that she
had seen of programmers on -


146
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:43,133 line:79% position:50% size:68%
on various television shows
or movies that we had seen


147
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,166 line:79% position:50% size:63%
and she was like, you
guys better get it right.


148
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,666 line:85% position:50% size:68%
So, I hope we got it right.


149
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:51,500 line:79% position:50% size:75%
Okay. This comes from Patricia
from Oakland, California.


150
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:55,966 line:79% position:50% size:60%
I freaking love watching
- I mean, two for two.


151
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:56,800 line:85% position:50% size:30%
Two for two.


152
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:59,366 line:79% position:50% size:45%
I freaking love -
it's a good start.


153
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:01,733 line:79% position:50% size:70%
I freaking love watching the
dysfunctional relationship


154
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,633 line:85% position:50% size:55%
between Poppy and Ian.


155
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,899 line:79% position:50% size:68%
It's honestly so validating
to see conversations I


156
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,699 line:79% position:50% size:60%
witnessed over my career
acted out on screen.


157
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:12,166 line:79% position:50% size:70%
As you were developing these
characters, what's one thing


158
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:15,433 line:79% position:50% size:60%
that struck you as truly
bizarro in tech culture?


159
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,433 line:79% position:50% size:60%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: You
know, one thing that did


160
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,399 line:79% position:50% size:58%
feel bizarre to me,
especially with Ian and


161
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:22,533 line:79% position:50% size:63%
Poppy's relationship, is
like, the - the fact that


162
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,800 line:79% position:50% size:58%
she literally builds
everything and yet he's


163
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:28,666 line:85% position:50% size:70%
considered to be the genius.


164
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,566 line:79% position:50% size:68%
I enjoyed playing with that
in their relationship.


165
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:32,800 line:85% position:50% size:60%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay.


166
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:36,399 line:79% position:50% size:60%
This is a question that
comes from Valentin from


167
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:39,433 line:85% position:50% size:48%
Mössingen, Germany.


168
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,833 line:79% position:50% size:65%
As a fifteen-year-old that
is heavily inspired by


169
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,399 line:79% position:50% size:70%
books, movies, and TV shows,
what are some of your tips


170
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:46,600 line:79% position:50% size:63%
for getting into the
business of storytelling,


171
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,466 line:79% position:50% size:50%
particularly through
movies and TV shows?


172
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:52,266 line:79% position:50% size:68%
>> IMANI HAKIM: I would say
no matter where you are in


173
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,899 line:79% position:50% size:65%
the world, to find your
community, find people who


174
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:59,533 line:79% position:50% size:65%
are already involved in
the space that you want to


175
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,000 line:85% position:50% size:68%
operate in, and read books.


176
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:05,100 line:85% position:50% size:15%
Study.


177
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,899 line:79% position:50% size:55%
Watch more movies like
you're already doing.


178
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:10,133 line:79% position:50% size:70%
But I think mainly just find
the community where you can


179
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,100 line:79% position:50% size:68%
learn and pick up new tools
from people who are already


180
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,366 line:85% position:50% size:38%
involved in it.


181
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,399 line:79% position:50% size:40%
>> DANNY PUDI: I
would say, yeah.


182
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:17,699 line:85% position:50% size:70%
Practice telling your story.


183
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,300 line:79% position:50% size:43%
I think that's
really important.


184
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:24,466 line:79% position:50% size:65%
The more you work on
telling your story or just


185
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:27,566 line:79% position:50% size:63%
storytelling in general,
whether that's working on


186
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:30,833 line:79% position:50% size:63%
videos for your family or
practicing jokes in the


187
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:33,466 line:79% position:50% size:68%
bathroom in front of your
mirror, not that I do that.


188
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,500 line:79% position:50% size:50%
I have some
friends who do that.


189
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:38,933 line:79% position:50% size:65%
But those things all help
you hone in on your voice,


190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,100 line:85% position:50% size:58%
so I think that's good.


191
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,033 line:79% position:50% size:60%
And then yeah, like what
Imani said, is find


192
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,033 line:85% position:50% size:30%
your people.


193
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,033 line:79% position:50% size:68%
Find people who are working
on aspects of storytelling


194
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,433 line:79% position:50% size:48%
that you're not, so
writers, directors.


195
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,466 line:79% position:50% size:68%
Form a little crew and work
together to help each other


196
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:54,600 line:85% position:50% size:28%
get better.


197
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,366 line:79% position:50% size:68%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Next
question comes from Russia.


198
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:01,333 line:79% position:50% size:63%
All right.
Ilya from Moscow, Russia.


199
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,199 line:85% position:50% size:63%
Lots of love from Russia.


200
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,866 line:79% position:50% size:63%
My question is, do any of
the cast members have any


201
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:10,233 line:79% position:50% size:50%
coding experience
at all in real life?


202
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,000 line:85% position:50% size:20%
Anybody?


203
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,166 line:85% position:50% size:48%
>> IMANI HAKIM: No.


204
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,100 line:79% position:50% size:68%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: When I
- when I got cast, I signed


205
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:20,199 line:79% position:50% size:60%
up to a - to a - like an
online school, like free


206
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,500 line:79% position:50% size:63%
coding school called Code
Academy, thinking like, I


207
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:26,399 line:79% position:50% size:70%
would, you know, just learn
the basics and then I'd have


208
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:28,766 line:79% position:50% size:70%
like a kind of understanding
that I could use in my


209
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:29,899 line:85% position:50% size:68%
portrayal of the character.


210
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:31,899 line:79% position:50% size:63%
And I think I tried to do
one lesson before I was


211
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:35,366 line:85% position:50% size:60%
like, no. I can't do it.


212
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,899 line:79% position:50% size:68%
And I still get emails from
them being like, pick up


213
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:39,000 line:85% position:50% size:48%
where you left off.


214
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:43,500 line:79% position:50% size:68%
And it makes me feel really
guilty and really stupid.


215
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,666 line:79% position:50% size:60%
>> MEGAN GANZ: I learned
the words server/client


216
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,200 line:85% position:50% size:33%
architecture.


217
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:52,066 line:79% position:50% size:70%
I don't know what it means
but I know it's a thing that


218
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:54,233 line:79% position:50% size:58%
I think
programmers care about.


219
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,066 line:79% position:50% size:65%
We - we need to get better
about it because - because


220
00:08:57,133 --> 00:09:00,200 line:79% position:50% size:70%
we have partners in Ubisoft,
what we do is in the script,


221
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,333 line:79% position:50% size:65%
whenever there are moments
where Poppy needs to


222
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,933 line:79% position:50% size:60%
describe what it is that
she's actually doing, we


223
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,533 line:79% position:50% size:68%
just write the word haptics
over and over because we


224
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,266 line:79% position:50% size:53%
heard that word once
and we were like, oh,


225
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,299 line:85% position:50% size:45%
that sounds techy.


226
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:13,066 line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, we just write haptics,
haptics, haptics and then


227
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:16,033 line:79% position:50% size:65%
the good people at Ubisoft
go through the scripts and


228
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,866 line:79% position:50% size:70%
replace those with actual
language that you might use.


229
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:20,766 line:85% position:50% size:60%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay.


230
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,366 line:79% position:50% size:53%
Oh, here's a question
from Portugal.


231
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:26,266 line:85% position:50% size:53%
From Viseu, Portugal.


232
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,399 line:85% position:50% size:68%
This person's name is João.


233
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:32,133 line:79% position:50% size:70%
And they would like to know,
which episode did you have


234
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,433 line:85% position:50% size:53%
the most fun filming?


235
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,433 line:79% position:50% size:70%
Imani, which episode did you
have the most fun filming?


236
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,666 line:85% position:50% size:48%
>> IMANI HAKIM: Oh.


237
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:43,200 line:79% position:50% size:70%
I would say all of the
episodes were really fun but


238
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:46,633 line:79% position:50% size:70%
I think the one that stands
out to me the most obviously


239
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,166 line:79% position:50% size:40%
is the - the
montage episode.


240
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:52,033 line:79% position:50% size:38%
Was that number
two, I believe?


241
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,899 line:85% position:50% size:48%
Episode number two.


242
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:58,366 line:79% position:50% size:68%
Rachel and Dana, they have
this fun montage and it was


243
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,399 line:79% position:50% size:60%
just really fun to
shoot and it's one of my


244
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,766 line:85% position:50% size:45%
favorite memories.


245
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,066 line:79% position:50% size:45%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY:
Hey, Danny.


246
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:07,933 line:79% position:50% size:65%
I have a question for you
and it - and it hails from


247
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,933 line:85% position:50% size:53%
Melbourne, Australia.


248
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,299 line:79% position:50% size:70%
And yes, Charlotte, you'll
get an opportunity to answer


249
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:13,533 line:85% position:50% size:28%
it as well.


250
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,566 line:85% position:50% size:43%
But I don't know.


251
00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:15,766 line:79% position:50% size:45%
>> CHARLOTTE
NICDAO: Melbourne.


252
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:16,833 line:79% position:50% size:63%
>> DANNY PUDI: Charlotte,
you can take any Chicago


253
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,133 line:85% position:50% size:55%
questions from now on.


254
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,899 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Good.
I've been studying up.


255
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:23,600 line:79% position:50% size:63%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: If you
were to create an app or


256
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:27,700 line:79% position:50% size:60%
a game, what would it be
and why, asks Yuma from


257
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:28,933 line:85% position:50% size:53%
Melbourne, Australia.


258
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,200 line:79% position:50% size:68%
>> DANNY PUDI: One app that
I actually use, I use this


259
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:33,433 line:79% position:50% size:68%
app which is a plant
recognition app that I love


260
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,433 line:79% position:50% size:70%
and it is - literally I just
ride my bike around the


261
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,600 line:79% position:50% size:68%
neighborhood and I take out
my phone and I'm like, look


262
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,533 line:85% position:50% size:33%
at that tree.


263
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,100 line:79% position:50% size:45%
I wonder what kind
of tree that is.


264
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,399 line:79% position:50% size:68%
And I like, snap a picture
of it and they're like, oh,


265
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,666 line:85% position:50% size:55%
this is a pepper tree.


266
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,466 line:85% position:50% size:53%
I'll be like oh, wow.


267
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:48,466 line:85% position:50% size:38%
That's so cool.


268
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,466 line:79% position:50% size:40%
And that's super
exciting for me.


269
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:55,366 line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, I think something
dealing with like, plants or


270
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:59,799 line:79% position:50% size:63%
maybe how to successfully
make plants live would be


271
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,299 line:79% position:50% size:45%
really kind of
cool for me to do.


272
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:02,700 line:79% position:50% size:70%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay, so,
Charlotte, it's clear that


273
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:07,299 line:79% position:50% size:68%
Danny blew that opportunity
to take a question.


274
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:11,133 line:79% position:50% size:65%
So, we're going to - we're
going to kick it to you,


275
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,566 line:79% position:50% size:53%
being from
Melbourne, Australia.


276
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:14,533 line:85% position:50% size:48%
We'll ask it again.


277
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,100 line:79% position:50% size:70%
If you were to create an app
or a game, what would it


278
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,166 line:85% position:50% size:28%
be and why?


279
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,100 line:79% position:50% size:55%
And how would it be
different from Danny's


280
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,933 line:85% position:50% size:25%
plant app?


281
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,233 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Okay,
see, I actually have an


282
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,399 line:85% position:50% size:60%
answer to this question.


283
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:28,500 line:79% position:50% size:70%
And it's going to - it's on
record now that it's my idea


284
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:32,000 line:79% position:50% size:60%
so if anyone steals it,
you know that it was me.


285
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,866 line:79% position:50% size:65%
It's a dating app but
instead of like, answering


286
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:37,533 line:79% position:50% size:58%
questions about
yourself, you get shown


287
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,066 line:85% position:50% size:45%
a series of memes.


288
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,799 line:79% position:50% size:70%
You decide which memes you
think are funny and then you


289
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:45,366 line:79% position:50% size:70%
get matched with people who
also find those memes funny.


290
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:47,233 line:85% position:50% size:45%
>> DANNY PUDI: Oh.


291
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:50,299 line:79% position:50% size:68%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: And
it's called - I'm trying to


292
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:51,866 line:85% position:50% size:65%
think of a pun on the fly.


293
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:55,899 line:85% position:50% size:63%
It's called You and Meme.


294
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,100 line:79% position:50% size:48%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY:
That's pretty good.


295
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,600 line:79% position:50% size:73%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: It'll
have a better name than that.


296
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:03,200 line:79% position:50% size:70%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay, so,
this comes from DJ from Ann


297
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:04,166 line:85% position:50% size:40%
Arbor, Michigan.


298
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:07,033 line:79% position:50% size:73%
What apps did you use to
shoot the quarantine episode?


299
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,833 line:85% position:50% size:70%
I believe I can answer that.


300
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,799 line:79% position:50% size:60%
We used - for our camera
app, we used something


301
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:18,366 line:79% position:50% size:63%
called Filmic Pro version
6.10.9 I believe.


302
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:23,033 line:79% position:50% size:58%
And it's just
incredibly easy to use.


303
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,166 line:79% position:50% size:70%
But what you're seeing mixed
with the hardware of the


304
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:29,633 line:79% position:50% size:70%
iPhone has created a
professional grade look that


305
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,866 line:79% position:50% size:48%
you saw in the
quarantine episode.


306
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:35,700 line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then the audio was - was
an app called MOTIV Audio


307
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:41,166 line:79% position:50% size:68%
version 2.62.1 or something
like that which would just


308
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,466 line:85% position:50% size:68%
be the most recent version.


309
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:45,333 line:79% position:50% size:65%
And again, it worked
really seamlessly with the


310
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,299 line:85% position:50% size:38%
camera package.


311
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,433 line:79% position:50% size:63%
And a mic system - that
hardware there was called


312
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,633 line:85% position:50% size:50%
Shure Mic MV88 Plus.


313
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,799 line:79% position:50% size:70%
And that worked really
seamlessly with the hardware


314
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:00,133 line:79% position:50% size:63%
as well and - and really,
that's - that's how we


315
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:06,233 line:79% position:50% size:63%
achieved 99.9% of the -
of the technical elements


316
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:08,200 line:85% position:50% size:30%
of the show.


317
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:09,766 line:85% position:50% size:70%
So, that's the boring stuff.


318
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,700 line:85% position:50% size:35%
Now moving on.


319
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:12,799 line:79% position:50% size:63%
Well, it's Developers
Conference so you kind of


320
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:13,766 line:85% position:50% size:55%
want the boring stuff.


321
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,700 line:79% position:50% size:40%
So, we'll mix it
in a little bit.


322
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:20,000 line:79% position:50% size:58%
This is a question from
Leonard from Singapore.


323
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,899 line:79% position:50% size:68%
Charlotte, is there
a scene that you personally


324
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:24,500 line:85% position:50% size:33%
really liked?


325
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:25,833 line:85% position:50% size:60%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: No.


326
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:29,266 line:79% position:50% size:45%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY:
Great. Moving on.


327
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,466 line:79% position:50% size:50%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO:
Yes. So many scenes.


328
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:36,100 line:79% position:50% size:63%
My top - my top scenes, I
loved shooting the mocap


329
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:41,166 line:79% position:50% size:58%
stuff in the masked man
episode with you, Rob.


330
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,500 line:79% position:50% size:40%
And I also loved
- you know what?


331
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,466 line:79% position:50% size:65%
I'm realizing now all my
favorite scenes are when I


332
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,700 line:79% position:50% size:65%
got to wear silly costumes
because I also loved


333
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:52,299 line:79% position:50% size:60%
shooting at the streamer
conference, pretty much


334
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,899 line:79% position:50% size:70%
anything where I got to wear
that masked man costume and


335
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,899 line:79% position:50% size:68%
especially the scene where
I was sitting in a beanbag.


336
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:01,633 line:79% position:50% size:70%
Like, I don't think I even
had any lines in that scene.


337
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,100 line:79% position:50% size:68%
I just enjoyed sitting in
that beanbag in my costume.


338
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,333 line:79% position:50% size:68%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: The next
question is from Henry from


339
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,966 line:85% position:50% size:53%
Kensington, Maryland.


340
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:12,266 line:79% position:50% size:68%
Danny, for the quarantine
episode, you had to be your


341
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,266 line:79% position:50% size:65%
own lighting designer,
audio team, camera person,


342
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,266 line:85% position:50% size:25%
et cetera.


343
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,633 line:79% position:50% size:70%
Which crew role did you turn
out to be a natural at and


344
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,966 line:85% position:50% size:55%
which one not so much?


345
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,266 line:79% position:50% size:38%
>> DANNY PUDI:
Great question.


346
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,433 line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, another app that I'm
working on is the best place


347
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,266 line:79% position:50% size:63%
to take a picnic and it's
designed to look at -


348
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,333 line:79% position:50% size:45%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY:
Okay. Moving on.


349
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,500 line:79% position:50% size:68%
Thank you, Danny.
Thank you, Danny, for that.


350
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:31,433 line:85% position:50% size:15%
Imani.


351
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,600 line:85% position:50% size:50%
>> IMANI HAKIM: Yes?


352
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,700 line:79% position:50% size:68%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: For the
quarantine episode, you had


353
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:34,833 line:79% position:50% size:70%
to be your own lighting
designer, audio team, camera


354
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,166 line:85% position:50% size:45%
person, et cetera.


355
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,200 line:79% position:50% size:70%
Which crew role did you turn
out to be a natural at and


356
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:40,600 line:85% position:50% size:55%
which one not so much?


357
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:45,100 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> IMANI HAKIM: I would
say I was - I was the most


358
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:52,566 line:79% position:50% size:48%
natural at maybe
sound and the glam.


359
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:56,633 line:79% position:50% size:65%
I think because - I've had
more practice at doing my


360
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,899 line:79% position:50% size:63%
own makeup so that came a
little bit more natural.


361
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,366 line:79% position:50% size:70%
And the things that I wasn't
the most natural at is for


362
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:07,200 line:79% position:50% size:68%
some reason we had to check
our settings multiple times


363
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:09,399 line:79% position:50% size:45%
and it just - I
couldn't remember.


364
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:13,633 line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, I applaud all of the DPs
and all of the hard workers


365
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,333 line:79% position:50% size:65%
in the crew because it
was - it was weird for me.


366
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,200 line:79% position:50% size:45%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY:
Charlotte?


367
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:22,833 line:79% position:50% size:60%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: I'm
the opposite of Imani.


368
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,166 line:79% position:50% size:70%
I was absolutely the bane of
our hair and makeup team's


369
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:28,666 line:85% position:50% size:48%
existence, I think.


370
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:31,899 line:79% position:50% size:55%
Even getting ready for
this today was just a


371
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:33,166 line:85% position:50% size:48%
nightmare for them.


372
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,399 line:85% position:50% size:43%
I don't know why.


373
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:38,566 line:79% position:50% size:68%
I think - I was joking with
Thea, our makeup artist,


374
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,966 line:79% position:50% size:63%
that my sister started
doing makeup when she was


375
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,600 line:79% position:50% size:65%
a teenager so she's really
good at it and I started


376
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,600 line:79% position:50% size:70%
doing makeup like since
quarantine started and I had


377
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,799 line:79% position:50% size:60%
to start doing it myself
for stuff like this.


378
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,633 line:79% position:50% size:63%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Imani,
this is a question again


379
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,033 line:79% position:50% size:60%
from Australia and we're
just not going to let


380
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,733 line:79% position:50% size:40%
Charlotte answer
any of these.


381
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,466 line:79% position:50% size:65%
Jimmy in Sydney, Australia
asks, you used multiple


382
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:00,733 line:79% position:50% size:40%
iPhones to shoot
this, right?


383
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,933 line:79% position:50% size:65%
I'm curious on how to
control all of them at the


384
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,500 line:79% position:50% size:70%
same time and how the
director was able to see the


385
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:07,433 line:79% position:50% size:55%
shooting in
progress in real-time.


386
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,433 line:79% position:50% size:63%
Imani, can you maybe just
walk us through from your


387
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,799 line:79% position:50% size:60%
perspective, what it was
like and how we - how we


388
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:16,533 line:79% position:50% size:50%
created the setup in
which we could work?


389
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600 line:85% position:50% size:53%
>> IMANI HAKIM: Yeah.


390
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:23,200 line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, Apple sent over a ton of
equipment for the actors to


391
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:26,333 line:79% position:50% size:65%
use, from iPhones to sound
equipment to lighting.


392
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,799 line:79% position:50% size:68%
And the way that we were
able to have Rob direct the


393
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:35,133 line:79% position:50% size:70%
episode and see everything
that's going on, we had - we


394
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,100 line:79% position:50% size:70%
had all the crew members and
the actors in the scenes on


395
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:43,766 line:79% position:50% size:70%
Zoom where we would have our
iPhones on this really cool


396
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:48,033 line:79% position:50% size:68%
contraption and it would -
it would show the screen to


397
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,233 line:79% position:50% size:70%
the people in the Zoom and
they were able to watch what


398
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:53,799 line:79% position:50% size:50%
we were doing
through the iPhones.


399
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:59,166 line:79% position:50% size:60%
It's a lot but it worked
really, really great.


400
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:01,799 line:79% position:50% size:70%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: And from
your perspective, one of the


401
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:04,133 line:79% position:50% size:68%
things I keep getting asked
about was because also we


402
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,366 line:79% position:50% size:70%
were - we were communicating
through AirPods, and a lot


403
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,465 line:79% position:50% size:70%
of - and we could barely see
each other because even in


404
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:12,566 line:79% position:50% size:65%
the rig that we have setup
right now, we can't really


405
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:14,366 line:79% position:50% size:60%
see each other because
we're blocked by so many


406
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,400 line:85% position:50% size:43%
different things.


407
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:19,000 line:79% position:50% size:70%
And people were asking, what
was it like to work with not


408
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,598 line:79% position:50% size:53%
only your other
actors in a scene but


409
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,766 line:85% position:50% size:48%
also direct people?


410
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,833 line:79% position:50% size:63%
And I found that in some
ways, it was a little bit


411
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,866 line:79% position:50% size:70%
more intimate because you're
so - obviously as actors,


412
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:35,233 line:79% position:50% size:70%
we're trained to listen to
what other people are saying


413
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:36,500 line:85% position:50% size:45%
and react to that.


414
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:38,933 line:79% position:50% size:68%
But oftentimes what happens
is because of so much


415
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,433 line:79% position:50% size:60%
nonverbal communication,
you're assuming what a


416
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,000 line:79% position:50% size:63%
person is going to say or
you're feeling it before


417
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:46,066 line:79% position:50% size:63%
they even say it and it
doesn't necessarily allow


418
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,466 line:79% position:50% size:60%
for you to listen to the
extent that you could


419
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,766 line:85% position:50% size:33%
or should be.


420
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,299 line:79% position:50% size:60%
And when you're limited
by not being able to see


421
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:55,533 line:79% position:50% size:70%
somebody but just hear them,
it almost opens up another


422
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,200 line:79% position:50% size:65%
form of communication
because you have to really


423
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:01,433 line:79% position:50% size:55%
pay attention to every
word and to the tenor


424
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,666 line:85% position:50% size:38%
of their voice.


425
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,900 line:79% position:50% size:63%
Did - did all of you guys
find something similar?


426
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:06,133 line:85% position:50% size:53%
>> IMANI HAKIM: Yeah.


427
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,099 line:79% position:50% size:68%
I think to your point, Rob,
I think it - like you said,


428
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:13,133 line:79% position:50% size:68%
it really forces you to
sort of drop in and be more


429
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,966 line:79% position:50% size:65%
connected than what - what
you would usually be.


430
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:18,266 line:79% position:50% size:68%
Like, we're pretty - we're
pretty connected on set but


431
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,933 line:79% position:50% size:63%
there was something about
this where we know that


432
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,733 line:79% position:50% size:70%
we're counting on each other
through the scene to get


433
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,500 line:79% position:50% size:65%
this story across, to get
this scene across in a way


434
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:28,900 line:79% position:50% size:63%
with barriers that we've
never experienced before.


435
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:31,400 line:79% position:50% size:58%
So, it's almost like it
forces you to have this


436
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:36,733 line:79% position:50% size:70%
sense of camaraderie and
community and to show up for


437
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,599 line:79% position:50% size:68%
each other in ways that you
didn't necessarily expect.


438
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,666 line:85% position:50% size:50%
>> DANNY PUDI: Yeah.


439
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:44,400 line:79% position:50% size:70%
I would say also, it does
make you listen a little bit


440
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:48,900 line:79% position:50% size:70%
more to the rhythm of scenes
in terms of how lines are


441
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,266 line:85% position:50% size:38%
coming through.


442
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,466 line:79% position:50% size:65%
There is this sort of
delicate balance of making


443
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:57,033 line:79% position:50% size:68%
sure that we're speaking in
a way that is natural but


444
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:01,299 line:79% position:50% size:63%
also not overlapping too
much, not - I think there


445
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:04,866 line:79% position:50% size:60%
was just a little bit
of a worry on my part of


446
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:09,700 line:79% position:50% size:65%
sometimes the wi-fi signal
not being super strong and


447
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:12,599 line:79% position:50% size:70%
worried that I either missed
the end of the line or


448
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,866 line:85% position:50% size:30%
I jumped it.


449
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:15,866 line:79% position:50% size:65%
And so, there's this like,
hyper listening but also


450
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:20,166 line:79% position:50% size:63%
just sort of like, almost
like at times, I was just


451
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,799 line:79% position:50% size:68%
relying on sort of like an
instinct of jumping in on a


452
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:25,266 line:79% position:50% size:70%
line just when I felt like I
think this is the right time


453
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,766 line:85% position:50% size:43%
to say this line.


454
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,266 line:79% position:50% size:63%
But you're just hyper
aware of people finishing


455
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,366 line:85% position:50% size:40%
thoughts, right?


456
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:34,533 line:79% position:50% size:63%
And so, that was kind of
a really interesting game


457
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,200 line:85% position:50% size:40%
within the game.


458
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:37,366 line:85% position:50% size:63%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Great.


459
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:43,000 line:79% position:50% size:60%
Meg, this one comes from
Tukwila, Washington.


460
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:46,433 line:79% position:50% size:70%
A gentleman named Rick wants
to know what is the most


461
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,733 line:79% position:50% size:68%
valuable lesson you've
learned about the industry?


462
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,666 line:79% position:50% size:65%
>> MEGAN GANZ: I would say
like the presence of women


463
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,233 line:85% position:50% size:68%
in the video game industry.


464
00:19:53,299 --> 00:20:00,200 line:79% position:50% size:70%
I - I had no - I kind of - I
had no idea that there were


465
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:04,000 line:79% position:50% size:70%
such an equivalent amount of
women playing video games


466
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:08,000 line:79% position:50% size:65%
and I guess you just don't
hear about it and it feels


467
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:09,900 line:79% position:50% size:63%
like a lot, when I was
growing up, the marketing


468
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:14,400 line:79% position:50% size:63%
was so directed towards
men that I guess I always


469
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,333 line:79% position:50% size:50%
assumed that that
was who was playing.


470
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,599 line:79% position:50% size:68%
And now, I'm being - my
eyes are being opened to an


471
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,000 line:79% position:50% size:70%
entire world of women not
only playing these games but


472
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:29,400 line:79% position:50% size:70%
also making them and - and
Ashly Burch who plays Rachel


473
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:32,233 line:79% position:50% size:70%
on the show who is you know,
heavily involved in the


474
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,666 line:79% position:50% size:65%
gaming community and has
done voice overs for a lot


475
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,433 line:79% position:50% size:63%
of great games, has
introduced me to a couple


476
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,500 line:79% position:50% size:70%
games that are just, I feel,
a little bit more feminine


477
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:44,900 line:79% position:50% size:63%
oriented and that I just
sort of didn't understand


478
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:46,500 line:79% position:50% size:48%
that there was that
space in gaming.


479
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:49,366 line:79% position:50% size:38%
So, it's been
a real delight.


480
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:53,000 line:79% position:50% size:60%
Also, just the narrative
that modern games, like,


481
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:57,433 line:79% position:50% size:65%
their ability to tell
complex and meaningful and


482
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,766 line:85% position:50% size:33%
deep stories.


483
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,900 line:79% position:50% size:68%
I mean, we - my husband and
I are just playing The Last


484
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:06,400 line:79% position:50% size:55%
of Us 2 now and it is,
I mean, breathtaking.


485
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,200 line:79% position:50% size:70%
Like, I can't play it before
I go to bed because it has


486
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:13,166 line:79% position:50% size:70%
that much of an effect on me
and I previously I guess,


487
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,633 line:79% position:50% size:70%
only thought that that was
possible with movies and TV.


488
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,366 line:79% position:50% size:43%
So, that's been
real eye opening.


489
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,433 line:79% position:50% size:68%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: This
hails from Charlotte, North


490
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,333 line:79% position:50% size:60%
Carolina which again, we
will not allow Charlotte


491
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,466 line:85% position:50% size:25%
to answer.


492
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,733 line:85% position:50% size:65%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: But -


493
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,833 line:79% position:50% size:63%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: From
Nick, the most unexpected


494
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,633 line:79% position:50% size:68%
response you've gotten from
someone about the show.


495
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,466 line:85% position:50% size:40%
And I'm kidding.


496
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:33,833 line:85% position:50% size:63%
Charlotte, handle it. Go.


497
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,799 line:79% position:50% size:78%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Oh, I want
to think about it though.


498
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:38,566 line:79% position:50% size:58%
Does anyone have an
answer quicker than me?


499
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:39,933 line:85% position:50% size:70%
Wait, what was the question?


500
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,733 line:79% position:50% size:48%
I was just thinking
about my name.


501
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,166 line:79% position:50% size:38%
>> DANNY PUDI:
It's Charlotte.


502
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:52,366 line:79% position:50% size:58%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY:
Your name is Charlotte.


503
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:53,233 line:79% position:50% size:38%
>> DANNY PUDI:
It's Charlotte.


504
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:54,133 line:85% position:50% size:60%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Yeah.


505
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,900 line:79% position:50% size:48%
>> DANNY PUDI: It's
always - right?


506
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:55,833 line:85% position:50% size:43%
It's always been?


507
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,866 line:79% position:50% size:48%
>> CHARLOTTE
NICDAO: Yeah, yeah.


508
00:21:56,933 --> 00:22:01,200 line:85% position:50% size:60%
>> DANNY PUDI: Still is.


509
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:03,766 line:79% position:50% size:58%
>> MEGAN GANZ: Danny,
can you make an app for


510
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,833 line:79% position:50% size:70%
Charlotte that can remember
her name for her so that she


511
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,866 line:79% position:50% size:63%
doesn't have to waste
valuable time remembering


512
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:09,966 line:85% position:50% size:43%
what her name is?


513
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:10,733 line:79% position:50% size:35%
>> DANNY PUDI:
Already on it.


514
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,000 line:85% position:50% size:40%
Name rememberer.


515
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,166 line:85% position:50% size:35%
Already on it.


516
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:14,933 line:79% position:50% size:63%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay.
I'll repeat the question.


517
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,599 line:79% position:50% size:70%
Nick from Charlotte, North
Carolina would like to know,


518
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,400 line:79% position:50% size:68%
what's the most unexpected
response you've gotten from


519
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:26,000 line:85% position:50% size:58%
someone about the show?


520
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:27,966 line:85% position:50% size:20%
Anybody?


521
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:31,166 line:79% position:50% size:68%
Anybody not named Charlotte
or named Charlotte?


522
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,966 line:79% position:50% size:70%
>> MEGAN GANZ: My mom really
likes it which I wasn't


523
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:36,533 line:79% position:50% size:68%
necessarily expecting
because the past shows that


524
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,233 line:79% position:50% size:68%
I've worked on, she usually
says they talk too fast.


525
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:42,700 line:85% position:50% size:68%
That's her major complaint.


526
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:44,799 line:79% position:50% size:68%
And I feel like we talk
pretty fast on the show but


527
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:46,400 line:85% position:50% size:65%
she still really likes it.


528
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,033 line:79% position:50% size:55%
She's never played
video games and has no


529
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:49,066 line:85% position:50% size:43%
interest in them.


530
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:52,666 line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, I think she just likes
CW and she's just showing up


531
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:54,133 line:85% position:50% size:60%
for that which is great.


532
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,266 line:85% position:50% size:35%
We'll take it.


533
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,633 line:79% position:50% size:70%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: I think
for - for me, I think it was


534
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:05,133 line:79% position:50% size:68%
- I believe it was the same
day, I saw two tweets in


535
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,066 line:79% position:50% size:68%
support of the show, one
from Elon Musk and one from


536
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:10,866 line:85% position:50% size:35%
Barry Jenkins.


537
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:13,966 line:79% position:50% size:68%
I thought that was a really
great day for the show.


538
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:15,200 line:85% position:50% size:65%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Yeah.


539
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:19,799 line:79% position:50% size:75%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay. Megan
Ganz, we have a question


540
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,366 line:85% position:50% size:63%
from Wilton, Connecticut.


541
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:26,000 line:79% position:50% size:70%
John Paul wants to know what
was the most eye-opening


542
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:29,666 line:79% position:50% size:65%
slash surprising thing
about shooting on iPhones?


543
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:31,900 line:79% position:50% size:70%
>> MEGAN GANZ: Oh, well, I
had some experience shooting


544
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:34,533 line:79% position:50% size:65%
on iPhones before because
I did an episode of Modern


545
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:39,866 line:79% position:50% size:65%
Family that was shot about
half on iPhones and -


546
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:41,433 line:79% position:50% size:70%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: We're not
here to talk about your Emmy


547
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,599 line:85% position:50% size:60%
winning endeavors, okay?


548
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,533 line:79% position:50% size:60%
We're here to talk
about your Apple show on


549
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,766 line:85% position:50% size:33%
Mythic Quest.


550
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,033 line:79% position:50% size:70%
So - Meg likes - Meg likes
to bring up all of the shows


551
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:51,633 line:79% position:50% size:68%
she won Emmys for except
for the ones that she works


552
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,799 line:85% position:50% size:28%
with me on.


553
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:55,133 line:79% position:50% size:43%
>> MEGAN GANZ:
All of them. One.


554
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,066 line:79% position:50% size:48%
I - aside from that
award-winning show,


555
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:04,933 line:79% position:50% size:70%
my experience, I mean, it's
kind of incredible, the ease


556
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,366 line:79% position:50% size:53%
at which - the - how
easy they are to use.


557
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:13,533 line:79% position:50% size:70%
I mean, I have zero idea of
what I'm doing as a director


558
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,866 line:79% position:50% size:55%
of photography, even
maybe less than I know


559
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:17,666 line:85% position:50% size:45%
about programming.


560
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:21,700 line:79% position:50% size:70%
And the fact that with just
a few settings on the phone,


561
00:24:21,766 --> 00:24:25,900 line:79% position:50% size:68%
we can produce footage that
looks absolutely equivalent


562
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:30,266 line:79% position:50% size:65%
to the footage that we get
from on set with the giant


563
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,200 line:85% position:50% size:68%
cameras is just phenomenal.


564
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:37,700 line:79% position:50% size:70%
You know, it's - it's really
- has removed all barriers


565
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:40,200 line:79% position:50% size:48%
to the - to the
filmmaking process.


566
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:43,766 line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's - if you would have
told people thirty years ago


567
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,933 line:79% position:50% size:68%
that they would have gotten
this kind of quality out of


568
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,766 line:79% position:50% size:70%
a phone that's in their
pocket, they just would have


569
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,400 line:85% position:50% size:48%
never believed you.


570
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:53,433 line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, I mean, it was a
fantastic experience for me.


571
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,133 line:79% position:50% size:70%
I am actually planning at
the moment, of shooting some


572
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,400 line:79% position:50% size:65%
more stuff on iPhones
that's not even - not even


573
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:01,966 line:79% position:50% size:63%
necessarily when we're in
quarantine because I just


574
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,400 line:79% position:50% size:40%
was so pleased
with the result.


575
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:07,400 line:79% position:50% size:70%
So, I encourage anybody that
is thinking about making


576
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:10,466 line:79% position:50% size:70%
something, especially if you
are looking at getting into


577
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,900 line:79% position:50% size:70%
the industry, I don't think
you should wait to make your


578
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:14,633 line:79% position:50% size:55%
mistakes once
you've gotten the job.


579
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,766 line:79% position:50% size:63%
I think you should start
shooting things now, edit


580
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,266 line:79% position:50% size:50%
them together, see
what they look like.


581
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,400 line:85% position:50% size:38%
Shoot it again.


582
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:20,466 line:85% position:50% size:25%
Reedit it.


583
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:22,466 line:79% position:50% size:68%
Like, see where your
mistakes are because you'll


584
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:25,500 line:79% position:50% size:70%
be developing skills and
making your mistakes when it


585
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,133 line:79% position:50% size:65%
doesn't count and then
hopefully when you get the


586
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,500 line:79% position:50% size:68%
opportunity to make a cool
episode like we did, you'll


587
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:34,099 line:79% position:50% size:70%
have gotten some of those
mistakes out of your system.


588
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:34,966 line:85% position:50% size:60%
>> ROB MCELHENNEY: Okay.


589
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,000 line:79% position:50% size:63%
Well, that seems like a
great place to finish up.


590
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:39,066 line:79% position:50% size:63%
Again, on behalf of the
entire Mythic Quest team,


591
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:42,799 line:79% position:50% size:58%
thank you for having us
at the WWDC this year.


592
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:44,833 line:85% position:50% size:45%
Have a great time.


593
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,533 line:85% position:50% size:63%
>> DANNY PUDI: Thank you.


594
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,366 line:85% position:50% size:48%
>> MEGAN GANZ: Bye.


595
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:47,200 line:85% position:50% size:70%
>> DANNY PUDI: Bye everyone.


596
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:47,900 line:79% position:50% size:38%
>> IMANI HAKIM:
Happy Dub-Dub.


597
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:48,833 line:85% position:50% size:73%
>> CHARLOTTE NICDAO: Dub-Dub.
