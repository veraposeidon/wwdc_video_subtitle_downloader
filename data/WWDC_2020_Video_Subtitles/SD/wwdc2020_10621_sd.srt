00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:07,074 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,043 line:0
Hi. My name is Hannah Gillis,


3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,380 line:0
and I’m here to show you how to declare
that your high-performance app


4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:17,985 line:0
or game requires advanced capabilities
unlocked by the latest hardware.


5
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,787 line:-2
To get started,
let’s begin with a refresher


6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,091 line:-2
of the required
device capability settings in Xcode.


7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,326 line:-1
We’ve had settings here for a while,


8
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,762 line:-2
but you might not be familiar
with using them.


9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,700 line:-2
Required device capabilities
is a list of device-related features


10
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,469 line:-1
your app requires to run.


11
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:40,841 line:-2
You add entries to this list
in your app’s Info.plist using Xcode.


12
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,214 line:-2
Entries in this list
indicate the specific capabilities


13
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,617 line:-2
of certain device families
that your app requires.


14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,489 line:-1
This list informs the App Store


15
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,059 line:-2
which device-related features
your app needs in order to run.


16
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,766 line:-2
And it prevents customers
from installing apps on a device


17
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,968 line:-1
that doesn’t have the necessary features,


18
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,571 line:-2
and an app will simply
not launch on devices


19
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:14,041 line:-2
that don’t satisfy
your device-related feature requirements.


20
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,245 line:-2
There are a few existing
device capabilities


21
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:22,082 line:-2
to enable high-end games
and pro applications on our devices.


22
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,318 line:-1
One is the Metal key,


23
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:28,288 line:-2
which means your app or game
requires the Metal Graphics API.


24
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:33,861 line:-2
Metal advanced graphics was enabled by
the capabilities of the A7 chip and GPU.


25
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,830 line:-1
Another key is for ARKit,


26
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:40,601 line:-2
which indicates that your app
requires devices that support AR,


27
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,470 line:-1
typically using an A9 chip or higher.


28
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:51,011 line:-2
In iOS 14, we are introducing a new key
specifically for performance,


29
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:55,048 line:-2
which requires devices
using an A12 Bionic chip or above.


30
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,118 line:-1
Specifying your need for A12 performance


31
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:03,290 line:-2
can help bring console and PC-quality
games and pro applications to iOS.


32
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,827 line:-1
Here’s the name of the key value


33
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,663 line:-1
to indicate an A12 Bionic requirement,


34
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,133 line:-1
and it’s provided in iOS 14 and Xcode 12.


35
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,604 line:-2
It indicates that your app
requires a device


36
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,507 line:-2
with the capabilities
of an A12 Bionic chip,


37
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:25,112 line:-1
which include a 6-core CPU and 4-core GPU,


38
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,814 line:-1
the second-generation Neural Engine,


39
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,485 line:-2
support for ARKit 3,
which brings people occlusion


40
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,221 line:-1
and motion capture to your AR experiences,


41
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,191 line:-1
and Metal GPU Family Apple 5.


42
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,427 line:-1
Here are some of the latest iOS devices


43
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:44,398 line:-2
using an A12 chip or higher
that support your application.


44
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,100 line:-1
iPhone 11 and 11 Pro.


45
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,838 line:-1
iPhone SE 2nd Generation.


46
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,541 line:-1
iPad Mini 5th Generation.


47
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,779 line:-1
And iPad Pro 4th Generation.


48
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,151 line:-2
You define this
performance level using Xcode.


49
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:09,990 line:-2
Navigate to your Info.plist, add an item
and choose the A12 requirement


50
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,492 line:-1
from the drop-down menu, as shown here.


51
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:19,132 line:-2
Now, when should you require A12 Bionic
or later for your application?


52
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,769 line:-2
First, remember that we encourage you
to make applications


53
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:26,840 line:-2
that scale across as many devices
as possible for all customers.


54
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,009 line:-1
We work to ensure that iOS runs great


55
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:32,546 line:-2
on both older and newer hardware
to help enable this.


56
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,117 line:-2
In rare occasions, however,
the experience you are creating


57
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:41,488 line:-2
is going to require the very latest
hardware to deliver the best gameplay


58
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,123 line:-1
or cutting-edge graphics.


59
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,992 line:-1
So here’s what we recommend checking.


60
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,762 line:-2
Most importantly,
do your performance optimization.


61
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,398 line:-2
Make sure you’ve made the effort
to bring your app


62
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:54,301 line:-1
to all devices that support iOS 14.


63
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,672 line:-2
We provide various tools to help tune
the performance of your applications,


64
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,008 line:-1
and we highly advise utilizing them.


65
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,578 line:-1
With this in mind, you can be confident


66
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,380 line:-1
when determining that your app needs


67
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:10,350 line:-2
the additional processing power
of an A12 Bionic chip or higher.


68
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,854 line:-1
Lastly, remember that your app


69
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:17,858 line:-2
should be aligned with iOS 14
to take advantage of this new key.


70
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,661 line:0
We encourage you to check out
our other sessions


71
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,399 line:0
around optimizing graphics,
games and memory usage


72
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:30,504 line:0
to ultimately delight as many customers,
all with various devices, as possible.


73
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,342 line:-2
When an app declares
this performance capability,


74
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,278 line:-2
that information
is also reflected in the App Store.


75
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,515 line:-2
In specifying this key,
customers are informed


76
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:44,351 line:-2
whether or not their device
supports the application.


77
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,455 line:-2
It even prevents users from
downloading apps on unsupported devices,


78
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,259 line:-2
so you can be sure your customers
always have clear communication.


79
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,530 line:-2
I’m really excited to share this
new performance capability with you.


80
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,900 line:-2
By specifying that your application
requires devices


81
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,236 line:-1
with the minimum of an A12 Bionic chip,


82
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,006 line:-2
we can ensure that high-end games
and desktop-quality apps


83
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:10,010 line:-2
are brought to iOS and supported
for the best user experience.


84
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,916 line:-2
Finally, I invite you
to try this new key for yourself,


85
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,087 line:-2
using iOS 14 Beta and TestFlight
for validation.


86
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,925 line:-2
And that wraps up
the new device performance key.


87
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,228 line:-2
As always, I’m looking forward
to seeing the apps you build.


88
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,899 line:-2
Take advantage of these unique
capabilities on iPhone and iPad.


89
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,433 line:-1
Thanks!
