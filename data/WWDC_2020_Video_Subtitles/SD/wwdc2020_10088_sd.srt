00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:06,340 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:11,812 line:0
Hi. I'm JP Lacerda, and I work
on the Proactive Intelligence team.


3
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,515 line:-2
An intelligent system experience
is a collaboration


4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,217 line:-2
between the operating system
and your apps.


5
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:20,888 line:-2
It is a platform convention
and a quality of great design.


6
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,291 line:-2
It's also powered in large part
by extensibility.


7
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,461 line:-2
Let's talk about the huge opportunity
that you have with intelligence.


8
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,864 line:-2
We'll start by defining
how we think about intelligence.


9
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,100 line:-2
Then we'll walk through
the many intelligence entry points


10
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,234 line:-1
on the system.


11
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,236 line:-2
We'll conclude by talking about
how you can measure


12
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,438 line:-1
the impact of intelligence on your app.


13
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,874 line:-1
So let's define intelligence.


14
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,343 line:-2
The goal of intelligence
is to make your Apple products


15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,179 line:-1
feel like they know you.


16
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,247 line:-1
Like they understand you,


17
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:50,350 line:-2
your goals, your intentions,
your habits, your preferences,


18
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,753 line:-2
your interests,
and even your relationships.


19
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,390 line:-2
And they can use this understanding
to help you achieve more


20
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:00,194 line:-2
by accelerating you to a goal
that you already have in mind.


21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,397 line:-2
And discover more by enriching your life
with meaningful content, people, places


22
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,601 line:-2
and apps,
delivered to you at just the right time.


23
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,672 line:-2
Intelligence helps you accomplish all this
with less tedium


24
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,075 line:-2
by saving you clicks or taps
to get to what you want,


25
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,812 line:-2
and also fewer distractions
by helping you focus on what matters most.


26
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,849 line:-2
Ultimately, intelligence allows
your Apple products


27
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,084 line:-1
to give you superpowers.


28
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,955 line:-2
As a developer, you play a crucial role
in the creation of these superpowers.


29
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,725 line:-2
Your app can participate in intelligence
by integrating with the system,


30
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:36,230 line:-2
which allows the system to see your app
as much more than a monolithic container.


31
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,765 line:-2
The capabilities of your app
extend to the system.


32
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,871 line:-2
And you get many more entry points
into your app beyond the home screen


33
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,939 line:-1
when we make suggestions on your behalf.


34
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,911 line:-2
Let's walk through some examples of this,
starting with Shortcuts.


35
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,449 line:-2
Shortcuts lets you get things done
with your apps with just a tap


36
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,117 line:-1
or by asking Siri.


37
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,219 line:-1
The Shortcuts app is built right into iOS,


38
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,357 line:-2
and allows you to set up simple or complex
multi-step shortcuts and automations.


39
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,193 line:-1
You can run Shortcuts with your voice,


40
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,461 line:-2
and get relevant suggestions
throughout the system,


41
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,833 line:-2
like in the new Siri Suggestions widget,
in Search, and on the lock screen.


42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,302 line:-1
New in iOS 14, if your app vends a widget,


43
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,338 line:-2
a Smart Stack will position your widget
at the top of the stack


44
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,675 line:-2
at just the right time,
like the Weather widget in this example.


45
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:25,445 line:-2
Let's look at other
intelligence entry points, like Sharing.


46
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:30,150 line:-2
Our devices allow users to create
beautiful content like photos and videos.


47
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,119 line:0
Sharing Suggestions make it really easy


48
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:35,889 line:0
to get content to the people in groups
that matter the most to you.


49
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,592 line:0
Intelligence also makes it easier
to get information on your app


50
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,594 line:0
to other parts of the system.


51
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,162 line:0
Like with Siri Event Suggestions,


52
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,331 line:-2
you can get reservations
from your app into Calendar.


53
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:48,268 line:-2
All you have to do is book a reservation,
like a restaurant reservation,


54
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,238 line:-2
and it'll automatically appear
in Calendar, just like this.


55
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,174 line:-1
On the lock screen, Siri can notify you


56
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,276 line:-2
when it's time to leave
for your restaurant reservation


57
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,145 line:-1
based on current traffic conditions.


58
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,315 line:0
When you open Maps,
you get Siri Suggestions,


59
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,883 line:0
which makes it super convenient


60
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,486 line:0
to get directions to the airport,
for example, with just one tap.


61
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,924 line:-2
Siri can proactively suggest
turning on Do Not Disturb,


62
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,860 line:-2
so you can stay focused
on what matters most,


63
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,595 line:-1
like the movie you're about to watch.


64
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,465 line:-2
And we may even provide a suggestion
to check in for a flight,


65
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,234 line:-1
right on your lock screen.


66
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,769 line:-2
But how can we measure
the impact of intelligence?


67
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,908 line:-2
Privacy is a fundamental human right,
and at Apple, it's one of our core values.


68
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,109 line:-1
If you choose to opt in,


69
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:32,546 line:-2
we use analytics from your device
to help us improve our products.


70
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,215 line:-2
The collected information
does not identify you personally,


71
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,985 line:-2
and can be sent to Apple
only with your explicit consent.


72
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,953 line:-2
Participating in intelligence
is a great way


73
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,589 line:-2
to improve the traffic, utility
and visibility of your app.


74
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,691 line:0
For example, when a user engages


75
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,560 line:0
on their first Sharing Suggestion
for your app,


76
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:47,928 line:0
they will, on average,


77
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:51,164 line:0
share twice as much as they did before
through your app.


78
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,468 line:0
We saw this trend across many apps
that opted into Sharing Suggestions.


79
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,670 line:0
Participating in intelligence
can also be a great way


80
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,206 line:0
to make your app more useful
to your users.


81
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,507 line:0
Some airlines shared with us


82
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,343 line:0
that they saw
82% of notification check-ins


83
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,746 line:0
come from their Siri Event Suggestion
check-in action.


84
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,450 line:0
Intelligence can also be a great way
to increase the visibility of your app.


85
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,886 line:0
Some third-party apps are seen,
on average,


86
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,722 line:0
five times every day on the lock screen,
in Sharing, in Search,


87
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,091 line:0
and other entry points
throughout the system.


88
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,793 line:-1
So, play your part in intelligence.


89
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,865 line:-2
You'll get more entry points into your app
and help your users build superpowers.


90
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,100 line:-2
Here are some concrete ways
you can do that.


91
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:31,138 line:-2
Think about which entry points
would be best suited to your app's actions


92
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,240 line:-1
and adopt those that make sense.


93
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,842 line:-2
You should also consider
how you will measure


94
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,910 line:-1
the impact of intelligence on your app.


95
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,746 line:-1
And finally, while this section covered


96
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,182 line:-2
your opportunity with intelligence
as a developer,


97
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,318 line:-2
you can build
an even more holistic view of intelligence


98
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,520 line:-2
by looking at it
from your users' perspective


99
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:49,623 line:-2
and how they may string together
these various experiences.


100
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,358 line:-1
To help you do this,


101
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,093 line:-2
in the "Meet People Where They Are"
section,


102
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,529 line:-2
Radhika is going to take you through
a day in the life of a user


103
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,898 line:-2
who benefits
from intelligent system experiences.


104
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,469 line:-2
I hope you've enjoyed this session,
and enjoy the rest of your WWDC.
