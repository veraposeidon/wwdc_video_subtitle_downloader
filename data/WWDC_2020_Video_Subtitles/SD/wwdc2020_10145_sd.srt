1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,406 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,312 line:0
-Hey, everyone. I'm Joe.
-And I'm Michael.


3
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,015 line:-2
And we're both designers
on the Game Center design team.


4
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,719 line:-2
We're here today to talk to you
about the new Game Center experience


5
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,621 line:-1
and a whole lot of enhancements we've made


6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,323 line:-2
to make it more engaging and beautiful
for players.


7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,393 line:-2
This session will give you an overview
of how to design your game


8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,395 line:-2
to make the most
of Game Center's features.


9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,899 line:-2
[Joe Phillips] There are a number of
reasons to add Game Center to your game,


10
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,767 line:-1
including social features,


11
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,937 line:-2
where players can add friends
and manage their gaming identity.


12
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:40,140 line:-2
Achievements and leaderboards
to encourage competition within your game


13
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,209 line:-2
and keep your players
coming back for more.


14
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:45,679 line:-2
And a rich multiplayer experience
for real time and turn-based games.


15
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,881 line:-1
To help you take advantage of all of this,


16
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,784 line:-2
we'll be talking in detail
about a number of things,


17
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,420 line:-1
starting with the access point,


18
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:56,723 line:-2
a consistent and recognizable way
for players to access Game Center


19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,258 line:-1
from within your game.


20
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:02,529 line:-2
Let's take a look at this feature
by launching a game.


21
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,598 line:-1
This is <i>The Coast</i>, an indie game


22
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,401 line:-2
where you have to carefully direct ships
away from the shore


23
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,170 line:-2
so they don't crash
and lose their precious cargo.


24
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,873 line:-2
When your game launches,
the first thing you'll see


25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,975 line:-1
is the Game Center welcome banner.


26
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:18,879 line:-2
When this goes away,
you'll notice a new UI element appear.


27
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,581 line:-1
This is the access point,


28
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:25,018 line:-2
a clear and easy way for players to access
their Game Center information on any game.


29
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,122 line:-2
The player's avatar serves
as the access point for Game Center.


30
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,793 line:-2
Tapping or clicking it at any point
will launch the new Game Center dashboard.


31
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,597 line:-2
It's where players can check out
their profile, achievements, leaderboards


32
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,633 line:-2
and other useful information
related to your game.


33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,635 line:-1
But we'll get to that in a minute.


34
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,838 line:-2
You can choose to present
just the player's avatar


35
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:48,008 line:-2
or pair it with bits of helpful
information we call "highlights."


36
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,978 line:-2
These highlights surface
a player's Game Center data,


37
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,881 line:-2
like achievement progress
and leaderboard positions.


38
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,450 line:-1
The access point is pretty flexible.


39
00:01:56,517 --> 00:02:00,354 line:-2
You can place it in any corner of
the screen that works for your game's UI.


40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,390 line:-2
However, we'd recommend
placing it at top left, if possible.


41
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:08,195 line:-2
And it works with how your game's designed
in both landscape and portrait.


42
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,465 line:-2
You'll just want to make sure
none of your game's UI


43
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:14,101 line:-2
encroaches upon the area
the access point takes


44
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:15,736 line:-1
at its maximum size.


45
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,205 line:-1
On iPhone 11 Pro,


46
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:22,843 line:-2
the access point on portrait games
is 62 by 335 points.


47
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,646 line:-2
We'd recommend leaving a safe area
of 114 points


48
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:29,082 line:-2
from the top or bottom of the screen
that spans the full width.


49
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,518 line:-1
And for landscape games,


50
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,121 line:-1
it's 62 by 280 points.


51
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,990 line:-2
It's best to leave a safe area
of 91 points


52
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,026 line:-1
from the top or bottom of the screen


53
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,594 line:-1
that spans the full width.


54
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,565 line:-2
The access point is available
across other platforms.


55
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,734 line:-2
You can find full details
on safe areas for other devices


56
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,603 line:-1
in the Human Interface Guidelines.


57
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,208 line:-2
Whenever possible, display your
access point at your game's main menu.


58
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,445 line:-2
Placing it here gives players quick access
before they dive into your game.


59
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,216 line:-2
Just be sure it appears at the right
moment within your game's launch sequence.


60
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,918 line:-2
Let any splash screens
or cinematics finish


61
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,787 line:-1
before displaying the access point,


62
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,722 line:-1
along with your game's main menu.


63
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,526 line:-2
If you can't place the access point
on your main menu,


64
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,963 line:-2
you could find another place for it
that players return to in your game,


65
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,831 line:-1
like on a level select screen


66
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,533 line:-1
or in Settings.


67
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,970 line:-2
As you can see, the access point
is designed to adapt to your game,


68
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,339 line:-2
but think about how to design
your game's UI


69
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,509 line:-2
to feel complementary
and fit naturally into the experience.


70
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,579 line:-2
When the game starts,
it's a good idea to hide the access point


71
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,581 line:-1
so players can focus on game play


72
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,484 line:-2
and allow space
for any critical in-game controls.


73
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,854 line:-2
The access point is the best,
most consistent way


74
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,957 line:-2
for users to access Game Center
from within your game.


75
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,895 line:-2
However, you can also link to Game Center
using your own custom UI.


76
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,565 line:-2
We've provided different icon options
to be used within your game--


77
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:55,702 line:-2
full color, white and black variants
in a variety of formats,


78
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,139 line:-2
all of which you can find
in the Apple Design Resources.


79
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:03,610 line:-2
Please use the iconography as provided
and don't alter it in any way.


80
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,947 line:-1
If your custom deep link includes text,


81
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,783 line:-2
please use the correct terminology,
Game Center,


82
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,652 line:-1
and don't localize this term.


83
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,288 line:-1
And that's the new access point.


84
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,423 line:-1
Just a few things to remember:


85
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,560 line:-2
Place the access point on your main menu
where possible.


86
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,963 line:-2
Find the best corner
to display your access point.


87
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,233 line:-2
Surface player information
with highlights.


88
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,269 line:-2
And ensure safe areas
around your access point.


89
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,338 line:-1
Joe, you're up.


90
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,173 line:-1
Thanks, Michael.


91
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,642 line:-2
Now let's move on
to the dashboard and profile.


92
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,946 line:-2
Tapping the access point
will reveal the dashboard,


93
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,081 line:-2
a jumping-off point
into each of the key areas


94
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,417 line:-2
that make up
the new Game Center experience.


95
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,787 line:-2
The dashboard is presented as
a transparent layer on top of your game,


96
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:49,356 line:-2
and it shows through the color
of the screen behind it.


97
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:51,425 line:-1
We recommend that you pause your game


98
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,594 line:-2
or minimize
any overly distracting animations


99
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,896 line:-1
when the dashboard is presented.


100
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,599 line:-2
The dashboard, along with
the rest of the Game Center UI,


101
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,869 line:-2
supports both landscape
and portrait orientation,


102
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,271 line:-2
to respect the way
your game has been designed.


103
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,941 line:-2
It has also been designed
to feel consistent across iOS,


104
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:11,178 line:-1
iPadOS, macOS and tvOS.


105
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:16,083 line:-2
On tvOS, you can also optionally
display artwork on the dashboard.


106
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,285 line:-1
This really helps brand the experience


107
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,654 line:-2
and makes it feel more integrated
into your game.


108
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,023 line:-1
When choosing the artwork to display here,


109
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,927 line:-2
please make sure that it comfortably
contrasts with the Game Center UI.


110
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,631 line:-2
Consider using transparency
to let the background show through.


111
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,901 line:-2
Make sure that the artwork
is simple, clear


112
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,136 line:-1
and reads well at a distance.


113
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,106 line:-2
The artwork you use here
shouldn't be your app icon.


114
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,674 line:-1
Instead, use something different.


115
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,577 line:-2
For example,
your game's logo or word mark.


116
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,679 line:-1
Dashboard artwork is not focusable.


117
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,682 line:-2
Here are the specifications
for uploading your dashboard artwork.


118
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:53,420 line:-2
It must be a TIFF or a PNG file
to support transparency.


119
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:58,859 line:-2
The image size should be
923 by 150 pixels at 1x...


120
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,863 line:-1
1846 by 300 pixels at 2x,


121
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:07,534 line:0
at least 72 DPI
and in the sRGB color space.


122
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,639 line:-2
The first section of the dashboard
provides access to the profile.


123
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,644 line:-2
Tapping on this shows players a holistic
overview of their Game Center profile--


124
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,113 line:-1
their friends, friend suggestions


125
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,949 line:-2
and the ability
to access their achievements


126
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,084 line:-1
across all of the games they have played.


127
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,788 line:-2
The profile is always accessible
from the dashboard.


128
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,858 line:-2
However, you can also optionally
provide a button inside your game


129
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,193 line:-2
to link players directly
to the profile page.


130
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,698 line:-2
This could be useful if you want to
encourage players to add more friends


131
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,869 line:-2
so that they can better enjoy your game's
leaderboard or multiplayer experience.


132
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,906 line:-2
If you want to provide a link
directly to the profile,


133
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,808 line:-1
please use this icon.


134
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,910 line:-1
You can style it to work with your game,


135
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,513 line:-1
but do not alter the shape in any way.


136
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,516 line:-2
To avoid confusion
with the design of the access point,


137
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,752 line:-2
please don't use the player's
Game Center avatar for this purpose.


138
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,956 line:-2
If pairing the link with text,
please use the correct language--


139
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,725 line:-1
Game Center Profile


140
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:09,029 line:-2
and not "profile" on its own,
"account" or anything else.


141
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,766 line:-2
And as mentioned before, the term
Game Center should not be localized.


142
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,036 line:-2
However,
you can localize the term "profile."


143
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,340 line:-2
The accompanying tech session
for Game Center will go into detail


144
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,242 line:-1
about how to link to the profile.


145
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,746 line:0
And that's the new dashboard and profile.


146
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,881 line:-1
Let's review what we just talked about.


147
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,953 line:-2
Remember to pause your game when
the Game Center user interface is open.


148
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,123 line:-2
You can optionally provide
dashboard artwork for tvOS.


149
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,894 line:-2
And if needed, you can link directly to
the Game Center profile from your game.


150
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,198 line:-1
Now over to Michael for the next section.


151
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:48,035 line:-2
And now on to my personal favorite update
to Game Center,


152
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,169 line:-1
achievements,


153
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,573 line:-2
which you'll find in the second section
of the dashboard.


154
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,077 line:-1
I used to love collecting trading cards.


155
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,645 line:-1
You just want to get them all,


156
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,115 line:-2
and there's nothing like getting the ones
that are hard to find.


157
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,251 line:-2
That's exactly why
we've redesigned achievements


158
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,320 line:-1
as a collectible card format.


159
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,423 line:-2
Here,
in the redesigned achievements section,


160
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,260 line:-2
players will see a lineup of these cards,
representing your game's achievements,


161
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,896 line:-2
which are now grouped
by "completed" and "locked."


162
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,031 line:-1
There are different kinds of achievements.


163
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,535 line:-2
Standard, which are earned straightaway
once the requirements are met.


164
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,672 line:-2
Progressive, which give players
a sense of how far away they are


165
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,008 line:-1
from unlocking an achievement.


166
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,677 line:-2
And hidden,
in which the details remain a mystery


167
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,613 line:-1
until the moment they're unlocked.


168
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,482 line:-2
Think about how to make the most
of these achievement types


169
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,784 line:-2
to improve the experience
of playing your game.


170
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,121 line:-2
And when a player completes
any achievement,


171
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,690 line:-2
an image appears
in the top portion of the card.


172
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,494 line:0
Make sure these images look awesome.


173
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:50,597 line:0
<i>The Coast</i> has all these great lighthouses
from around the world.


174
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:52,232 line:0
I got this one in Level 5.


175
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,836 line:0
The Passage Lighthouse is
in the Great Lakes near Mackinac Island.


176
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:59,506 line:0
This should be eye-catching,
complement your game's look and feel,


177
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:03,076 line:0
and make players feel rewarded
by getting something special.


178
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,513 line:0
It's a big step in keeping players
engaged in your game.


179
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,517 line:0
Stay away from using text
inside your artwork


180
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,220 line:0
and upload custom images
for each achievement.


181
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:17,291 line:0
Players love earning unique achievements
that remind them of each accomplishment.


182
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,328 line:-2
And provide an opaque image
for each achievement.


183
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,264 line:-2
The system automatically
crops the image into a circle,


184
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,733 line:-2
so make sure
any primary content is centered.


185
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:30,704 line:-2
Achievement images are for display only,
so they're not focusable.


186
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:35,175 line:-2
Order your achievements in a way that
reflects the progress of your game play.


187
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,911 line:-2
You're allowed up to 100 achievements
in a game.


188
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,214 line:-1
Be selective about how many you provide.


189
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,350 line:-2
It's good to only use what you need
to make your game challenging,


190
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,652 line:-1
so earning every one feels rewarding.


191
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:49,857 line:-2
And rather than offer all 100
in version one of your game,


192
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:54,127 line:-2
leave room to add more in later releases
to give players a reason to come back.


193
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:58,031 line:-2
There's just a few rules to consider
around achievement images.


194
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,902 line:-1
It must be a JPEG, TIFF or PNG file,


195
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,806 line:-1
512 by 512 pixels at 1x,


196
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:09,009 line:-1
1024 by 1024 pixels at 2x,


197
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,945 line:-1
at least 72 DPI


198
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,147 line:0
and in the sRGB color space.


199
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,584 line:-2
You'll also need to include a title
and description text


200
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,887 line:-1
for each of your achievements.


201
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,456 line:-2
Make sure they're
as clear and succinct as possible


202
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:25,592 line:-2
so players understand
how to earn an achievement at a glance.


203
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,596 line:-2
And since achievement cards show
two lines of your title and description


204
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,064 line:-1
before truncating,


205
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,100 line:-1
try to keep your text under 30 characters


206
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,903 line:-2
to guarantee it will work well
across devices.


207
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,840 line:-2
Keep your titles initial caps,
your description sentence case


208
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,575 line:-1
and avoid using all caps.


209
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,411 line:-1
And for those final touches to copy,


210
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:48,282 line:-2
include a second description
for when an achievement's been completed.


211
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,852 line:-2
And make sure all copy is localized
depending on the country or region.


212
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,690 line:-2
You can also choose to present
in-game achievement notifications


213
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,626 line:-2
that give your players
an immediate sense of accomplishment.


214
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,529 line:-2
We definitely recommend
you work these into your game.


215
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,532 line:-2
Time these to display right
at that moment of completion.


216
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,702 line:-2
Like here, in <i>The Coast</i>,
as soon as players clear the level.


217
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,772 line:-2
If you'd like to give players
more direct access,


218
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,276 line:-2
you can also provide a custom link into
the achievement section of Game Center.


219
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,246 line:-2
If you'd like to use iconography,
use this,


220
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:21,815 line:-1
which features the card representation.


221
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:24,318 line:-2
You can style it to work
with your game's UI,


222
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,520 line:-1
but don't alter the shape in any way.


223
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,290 line:-2
Also just be consistent
in how you refer to them,


224
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,194 line:-2
using the term "achievements"
and not "trophies" or "awards"


225
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,529 line:-1
or anything else.


226
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:37,764 line:-1
That's the new achievement experience.


227
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,333 line:-1
Let's recap.


228
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,903 line:-2
Use achievement types
to work with your game.


229
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,973 line:-1
Design unique, eye-catching images.


230
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,642 line:-2
Keep those descriptions
clear and succinct.


231
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:53,113 line:-2
And incorporate in-game notifications
for some of that immediate reward.


232
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,082 line:-1
Back over to you, Joe.


233
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,817 line:-1
Thanks, Michael.


234
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,987 line:-2
The next section of the dashboard
features your game's leaderboards.


235
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:05,559 line:-2
A great place to encourage a player
to compete with their friends


236
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,694 line:-1
and keep them coming back for more.


237
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,497 line:-2
Tapping into this section
provides an overview


238
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,733 line:-1
of all the leaderboards in your game.


239
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,036 line:-2
We recommend that you create leaderboards
that best represent the core mechanics


240
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,038 line:-1
of your game play.


241
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,741 line:-2
They could be tied
to a specific score in your game.


242
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,943 line:-1
For example, the longest distance traveled


243
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,379 line:-1
or the total number of coins collected,


244
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,614 line:-1
or alternatively, like in <i>The Coast</i>,


245
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:31,552 line:-2
each of the leaderboards are tied to
a specific geographic region in the game.


246
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,889 line:-2
Let's focus on the first leaderboard,
Crater Lake.


247
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,559 line:-1
When designing your leaderboard imagery,


248
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,627 line:-2
you should provide unique,
eye-catching artwork


249
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,696 line:-1
that is recognizable at a glance.


250
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,899 line:-2
Ensure that you use different artwork
for each leaderboard


251
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,235 line:-2
so that players
can differentiate between them.


252
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:52,472 line:-2
And also consider how your leaderboards
look alongside each other,


253
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,808 line:-1
so that they feel complementary as a set.


254
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,245 line:-1
For leaderboard image specifications,


255
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:02,216 line:-2
images must be a JPEG,
a TIFF or a PNG file,


256
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,186 line:-1
at 512 by 512 pixels at 1x,


257
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:09,289 line:-1
1024 by 1024 pixels at 2x,


258
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,625 line:-1
at least 72 DPI


259
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,727 line:0
and in the sRGB color space.


260
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:18,632 line:0
On tvOS, leaderboards
have a 16-by-9 aspect ratio.


261
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:22,402 line:0
They're also focusable and support
between one and three multilayer images


262
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,271 line:-1
to provide a parallax effect.


263
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:28,242 line:-2
During focus on parallax,
content around the edges of some layers


264
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,611 line:-1
may be cropped or difficult to see clearly


265
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,479 line:-1
as the image scales and moves.


266
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,449 line:-2
To ensure that your primary content
is always visible,


267
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:37,584 line:-1
please don't place it close to the edges.


268
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,422 line:-2
tvOS leaderboard images
have different upload specifications.


269
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,491 line:-1
Images must be a PNG file,


270
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:48,562 line:-1
at 659 by 371 pixels at 1x,


271
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:52,833 line:-1
1318 by 742 pixels at 2x,


272
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,768 line:-1
at least 72 DPI


273
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,904 line:0
and in the sRGB color space.


274
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,306 line:-1
You can find a more detailed overview


275
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,875 line:-2
of how to design focusable layered images
for tvOS


276
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,844 line:-1
in the Human Interface Guidelines.


277
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,649 line:0
Leaderboards can only show
a maximum of two lines before truncating.


278
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:12,019 line:0
We recommend keeping your
leaderboard titles under 30 characters


279
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,388 line:0
to guarantee that it will work well
across all devices


280
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,190 line:0
and accessibility settings.


281
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,660 line:0
Keep titles for your leaderboards
initial caps


282
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,728 line:0
and please avoid using all caps.


283
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:27,868 line:-2
Tapping into one of these reveals
the scores for the specific leaderboard.


284
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,904 line:-2
We have redesigned leaderboards
to be focused on friends,


285
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,440 line:-2
the players you care about
competing with the most.


286
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,542 line:-1
Speaking of which, Michael,


287
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,511 line:-1
you've got a bit of catching up to do.


288
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:41,715 line:-2
You can also embed the information from
your leaderboards directly into your game


289
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:44,351 line:-2
to give players visibility
when it matters the most.


290
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:48,355 line:-2
For example, you can give your players
a chance to see their position


291
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,123 line:-1
before they start a level,


292
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,659 line:-2
or at the end
after they beat their friends' top score.


293
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:55,762 line:0
The Game Center tech session
will go into detail


294
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,565 line:0
about how to embed leaderboard data
into your game.


295
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:03,704 line:-2
You can also choose to link directly into
the leaderboard section of Game Center,


296
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,807 line:-2
or even directly into
a specific leaderboard if you want to.


297
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,612 line:-2
If you'd like to do this,
please use the icon that we have provided.


298
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,181 line:-2
You can style it to work
with your game's UI,


299
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,517 line:-2
but please do not alter the shape
in any way.


300
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,622 line:-2
If accompanying the icon with text,
please use the correct language--


301
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:26,426 line:-2
"leaderboards," and not "rankings"
or "scores" or anything else.


302
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:29,129 line:-1
And that's leaderboards.


303
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,565 line:-1
As a summary of what we just covered,


304
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:35,669 line:-2
please design unique, eye-catching artwork
for each leaderboard.


305
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:39,940 line:-2
tvOS requires a custom
16-by-9 layered artwork.


306
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,943 line:-1
Keep your descriptions short and succinct.


307
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,779 line:-2
And you can optionally embed
leaderboard data into your game


308
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:49,349 line:0
and also provide direct links
to specific leaderboards.


309
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,918 line:-1
Now back to Michael.


310
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:53,353 line:-1
Let's touch on multiplayer.


311
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,859 line:-2
Game Center lets you easily take advantage
of its robust set of multiplayer features


312
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:01,094 line:-1
for real time and turn-based games.


313
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:06,433 line:-2
All you'll need is a button as a clear way
for players to open the multiplayer lobby.


314
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,970 line:-2
The new, redesigned lobby
makes it simple and easy


315
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,872 line:-1
to jump into a game.


316
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,140 line:-1
When the lobby opens,


317
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:16,176 line:-2
you may want to pause any distracting
animation in the background


318
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,812 line:-1
so players can focus on inviting friends.


319
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,148 line:-1
Tapping "add" reveals the player picker.


320
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:25,586 line:-2
From here, you can see
nearby players, friends,


321
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,855 line:-1
recent players and contacts.


322
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:30,724 line:-1
Tap a player to add them to the lobby.


323
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,828 line:-2
And when you're ready,
just tap "Invite and Start."


324
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:38,065 line:-2
And if you'd like, you can also
implement our multiplayer features


325
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,733 line:-1
without using our UI


326
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,702 line:-1
by building it directly into your game.


327
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,238 line:0
Check out the tech session
for more details.


328
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,473 line:-1
Back over to you, Joe.


329
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,242 line:-1
Thanks, Michael.


330
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,910 line:0
And now on to the final section.


331
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:53,981 line:0
Game Center is now closely integrated
into the App Store.


332
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,951 line:-2
Visitors to the store will now be able
to access their Game Center profile,


333
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,454 line:-1
see their achievements, add friends


334
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,789 line:-2
and browse the games
their friends are playing.


335
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,425 line:-2
Your friends' avatars
will now show up on app icons


336
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,829 line:-1
and feature prominently in the game's tab.


337
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,500 line:-2
Friends playing will also be highlighted
on your game's product page.


338
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,736 line:-2
You can see them here
at the top of the page


339
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,204 line:-1
and also in more detail further down.


340
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,808 line:-2
All of this will be enabled by simply
integrating your game with Game Center,


341
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,478 line:-2
giving your game a great chance
to be featured on the App Store.


342
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,246 line:-1
And that takes us to the end.


343
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:29,383 line:-2
Now back to Michael for a summary
of everything we've just talked about.


344
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,552 line:-1
Thanks, Joe.


345
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,987 line:-1
And that's the new Game Center experience.


346
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,724 line:-2
A new way to access Game Center
with in-game highlights,


347
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,927 line:-1
the fully redesigned dashboard,


348
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,062 line:-1
our beautiful collectible achievements,


349
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,964 line:-1
our engaging leaderboards


350
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,699 line:-1
and a whole lot more.


351
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:48,535 line:-2
Please remember that everything
we discussed can be found in more detail


352
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:50,470 line:-1
in the Human Interface Guidelines.


353
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,407 line:-2
We're looking forward to see
what you do with Game Center,


354
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:56,143 line:-2
and we can't wait to play
all the games you design.


355
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,277 line:-1
Thank you.


356
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,712 line:-1
Thanks a lot.
