00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,407 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:12,479 line:0
Hi. My name is Michael Rojas,
and I work on the Shortcuts team.


3
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:16,283 line:0
Today, we're going to talk about
how you can feature your app's shortcuts


4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,053 line:0
with Wind Down,
which is part of our new Sleep experience.


5
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:24,925 line:-2
First, we'll go over how the new Wind Down
experience works with shortcuts.


6
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:28,028 line:-2
Then we'll explain
how you can use some new APIs


7
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,898 line:-2
to integrate the actions from your app
with Wind Down.


8
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:35,369 line:-2
And finally, we'll go over
how to use some existing APIs


9
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,539 line:-2
to make sure it's super easy
for people to add your action


10
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,508 line:-2
when they set up and personalize
their Wind Down experience.


11
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,177 line:-1
So let's dive in.


12
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,146 line:-1
So, what is Wind Down?


13
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:50,250 line:-2
At its core, we built Wind Down
to help you meet your sleep goals.


14
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,454 line:-2
Sometimes that means focusing
on the things that will relax you


15
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,258 line:-2
or give you some space
and mindfulness after a long day.


16
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,727 line:-2
For some of you,
it might mean getting a heads-up


17
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,864 line:-2
on what is most important for tomorrow
before going to bed.


18
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,335 line:-2
We built a way to quickly get
to your favorite things in Wind Down mode,


19
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,470 line:-1
and it's called "Wind Down Shortcuts."


20
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,609 line:-2
Here are some Wind Down Shortcuts
that I can run with just a couple of taps.


21
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:19,046 line:-2
For example, I have a shortcut
from Ten Percent Happier


22
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,848 line:-1
that starts a sleep meditation.


23
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,885 line:-1
I also have a custom Sleepy Time shortcut


24
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,622 line:-2
that plays relaxing music
and adds an entry to my night journal.


25
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,460 line:-2
And I have a shortcut
to set my "Relax" home scene


26
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,262 line:-1
that dims all of my lights.


27
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,766 line:-2
You can create
your own Wind Down Shortcuts


28
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,503 line:-1
in the Health app's new sleep setup flow.


29
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,739 line:0
During this setup flow,
you'll be given the option


30
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:49,109 line:0
to add shortcuts you want to see
on the lock screen during Wind Down.


31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,412 line:0
Let's take a look
at how you can add a shortcut.


32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,115 line:0
After tapping on "Set Up Shortcuts,"


33
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,719 line:-2
you can choose from the list
of suggested shortcuts shown here.


34
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,389 line:-2
I'm getting a suggestion
to open Day One for journaling


35
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,858 line:-1
and some meditation apps for mindfulness.


36
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,628 line:-1
I'm going to select Ten Percent Happier.


37
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,865 line:-2
As you can see, this shortcut was added
to my list of Wind Down Shortcuts.


38
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,336 line:-2
You can edit these or add more
straight from the Health app.


39
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:20,774 line:-2
In addition, all of these shortcuts
can be accessed from the Shortcuts app


40
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,876 line:-1
in a new Sleep Mode collection


41
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,746 line:-2
that will appear once you've added
a Wind Down shortcut.


42
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:32,452 line:-2
You can get any existing or new shortcut
to show up in the Sleep Mode collection


43
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,023 line:-2
by simply flipping on
the "Show in Sleep Mode" switch


44
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,624 line:-1
in the shortcut's detail view.


45
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,694 line:-1
We've also built some new APIs


46
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:44,932 line:-2
that allow you to feature shortcuts
from your app in the Wind Down setup flow


47
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,368 line:-2
so they can be run
with just a few taps from the lock screen.


48
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,506 line:-2
The main way your app can expose
its actions is through intents.


49
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,842 line:-2
Your app can adopt
one of the built-in intents


50
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,077 line:-1
such as INCreateNoteIntent


51
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,546 line:-1
or define its own custom intents.


52
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,250 line:-2
We have a great video about
how to choose the right Siri technology.


53
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,319 line:-1
Make sure to check it out.


54
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,221 line:-1
Once you've built out your intent,


55
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:11,558 line:-2
you can take advantage of a new property
called shortcutAvailability.


56
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,961 line:-2
Let's take a deeper look
at this new property.


57
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,532 line:-2
We added a new property
called shortcutAvailability to INIntent,


58
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,668 line:-2
which you can use to tell us
which of your app's actions


59
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,670 line:-1
should appear in the Wind Down setup.


60
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,208 line:-2
We also added the same property
on NSUserActivity,


61
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,911 line:-2
if that's what you're using
to represent your action.


62
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,715 line:-2
Now let's take a look
at the different options that you can set.


63
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,152 line:-2
Here are the different
shortcut availability options.


64
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,990 line:-2
These options match the categories
in the Wind Down setup flow.


65
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,660 line:-1
For example, if you're a meditation app,


66
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,697 line:-2
you might want to mark your
start meditation intent or user activity


67
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,033 line:-1
with the mindfulness option.


68
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,069 line:-2
This will allow your app's meditation
to quickly be accessed


69
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,205 line:-1
from the lock screen when in Wind Down.


70
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:03,443 line:-2
If you're an app that helps people
get ready for tomorrow,


71
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,712 line:-1
such as a Notes app or Weather app,


72
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,148 line:-2
you should use
the Prepare for Tomorrow option.


73
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,919 line:-2
Here's what those categories
look like in code.


74
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,755 line:-1
Now, let's take a look at an example.


75
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:20,527 line:-2
This sample app,
which, naturally, we've named Bedtime,


76
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,764 line:-2
helps people fall asleep
by playing soundscape stations


77
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,435 line:-2
such as "Sleepy Dinosaur Sounds"
and soothing "Cooking White Noise."


78
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,537 line:-1
Maybe not for everyone, but for me,


79
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,473 line:-2
this sounds like a great candidate
for the "sleep music" option.


80
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,942 line:-1
So let's go for it.


81
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,478 line:-2
To get started,
I'm going to create my intent.


82
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,816 line:-2
In this case,
I'm using the system INPlayMediaIntent


83
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,419 line:-2
because that allows me
to start audio sessions.


84
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:51,091 line:-2
Then I'm going to set the shortcut
availability options to sleepMusic.


85
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,028 line:-2
Next, I'm going to wrap my intent
in an INShortcut.


86
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,800 line:-2
Grab the shared property
on INVoiceShortcutCenter.


87
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,636 line:-2
And finally,
I'm going to provide it to the system


88
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,372 line:-1
by calling setShortcutSuggestions.


89
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,941 line:-1
It's as easy as that.


90
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,811 line:-2
Now my bedtime action
will show up in the Music section


91
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:13,247 line:-2
when someone sets up
their Wind Down experience.


92
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,251 line:-2
It's important to keep in mind
that not every action from your app


93
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,020 line:-2
will actually help people
reach their sleep goals.


94
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:25,025 line:-2
For example, starting yoga for relaxation
would be perfect


95
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,561 line:-1
for the yoga and stretching category.


96
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,831 line:-2
But starting a warm-up run
probably wouldn't be the best way


97
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,499 line:-1
to get ready for bed.


98
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,401 line:-1
So not a good candidate.


99
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,872 line:-2
Likewise, it's easier to wind down
to a relaxing soundscape


100
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,807 line:-1
than it is to a wake-up mix.


101
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:45,779 line:-2
And clearly, starting a meditation
is better for getting a good night's sleep


102
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,748 line:-1
than starting a meeting.


103
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,018 line:-2
So you'll need to choose
only the right actions from your app,


104
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,720 line:-2
and ultimately,
you'll be the best judge of that.


105
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:57,558 line:-2
Just always keep
the user experience in mind.


106
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,793 line:-1
What helps people fall asleep?


107
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,597 line:-2
Now let's take a look
at what you need to do


108
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,466 line:-2
once you've chosen
the right actions from your app.


109
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,370 line:-2
There are two things you can do
to enable the system


110
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,340 line:-2
to suggest your app's actions
during Wind Down setup.


111
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,310 line:-1
First, as I mentioned earlier,


112
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,246 line:-2
you can suggest shortcuts to the system
that you want to feature


113
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:23,884 line:-2
by calling setShortcutSuggestions
on INVoiceShortcutCenter.


114
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,087 line:-2
If your app's actions
change at some point,


115
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:30,624 line:-2
make sure to set it again
so only the most relevant actions appear


116
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,726 line:-1
in Wind Down setup.


117
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:37,564 line:-2
Another thing you should do is donate
the intent or user activity to the system


118
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:41,668 line:-2
when someone performs the action
in their normal, everyday use of the app.


119
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,440 line:-2
This helps the system understand
what the most important actions are,


120
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:50,310 line:-2
so we can do our best to surface them
prominently in Wind Down setup


121
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:54,515 line:-2
and even in other places
like search and lock screen suggestions.


122
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:58,352 line:-2
Now let's talk about how to decide
between suggesting and donating.


123
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:02,289 line:-2
You should both suggest shortcuts
to the system and donate,


124
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,525 line:-1
as they each have benefits.


125
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:09,029 line:-2
One benefit of suggesting shortcuts
through INVoiceShortcutCenter


126
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,498 line:-2
is that it will ensure
that these actions from your app


127
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,300 line:-1
will be featured in Wind Down.


128
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,705 line:-2
For example, I have an action
to play the soundscape of the day


129
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,275 line:-1
that I always want to be easy to find,


130
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,610 line:-1
so I'm going to set that as suggested.


131
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,546 line:-1
Here's how to do that in code.


132
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,515 line:-1
First, initialize the INPlayMediaIntent.


133
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:33,587 line:-2
Next, make sure to set
the shortcut availability if it applies.


134
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,023 line:-1
In this case, I'll set it to sleepMusic.


135
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:40,060 line:-2
Don't forget to set
the suggested invocation phrase.


136
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,229 line:-2
This will be the phrase
someone can say to Siri


137
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,998 line:-1
to execute this action with their voice,


138
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,068 line:-2
and it's also the phrase displayed
on the Wind Down screen


139
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,636 line:-1
to describe the shortcut.


140
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,106 line:-1
Then create a shortcut from the intent.


141
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:58,478 line:-2
And finally, suggest the shortcut
on INVoiceShortcutCenter.


142
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,414 line:-1
Now let's take a look at donating.


143
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:05,485 line:-2
When an action is performed in your app,
such as playing a track,


144
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,821 line:-2
you should donate that action
to the system


145
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,791 line:-2
so it can learn
from the person's behavior.


146
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,860 line:-1
Let's take a look at this in code.


147
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,496 line:-2
To donate an intent
when actions are performed in your app,


148
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,999 line:-1
you first initialize the intent.


149
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,402 line:-2
Next, make sure to set
the shortcut availability.


150
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:27,274 line:-2
Again, I'm going to make sure
to set the suggested invocation phrase,


151
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,409 line:-1
this time to the name of the track.


152
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,546 line:-1
Wrap it in an INInteraction.


153
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,682 line:-2
And finally,
call donate on the interaction


154
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,985 line:-2
to tell the system
that a track was played.


155
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,922 line:-1
And to donate a user activity,


156
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,391 line:-1
first initialize the user activity.


157
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,062 line:-2
Make sure it's eligible for search
and also for prediction.


158
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,565 line:-1
Set a title.


159
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:56,370 line:-2
Set the suggested invocation phrase
and the shortcut availability.


160
00:08:56,937 --> 00:09:02,009 line:-2
And finally, set the view controller's
user activity property to donate it.


161
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,212 line:-1
As you saw in the code samples just now,


162
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,215 line:-2
you should be sure to set
the suggested invocation phrase


163
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,584 line:-1
on your intent or user activity,


164
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,654 line:-2
as this is what's used
for naming the shortcut from your app


165
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,357 line:-2
and also what's displayed
on the lock screen during Wind Down.


166
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:22,629 line:-2
A suggested invocation phrase
should be short and concise,


167
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,300 line:-2
since it has to fit in the small screen
real estate on the lock screen


168
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,171 line:-2
and should allow users to be able
to uniquely identify the shortcut


169
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,573 line:-1
based on the name.


170
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,876 line:-2
Let's take a look
at how to choose a good phrase.


171
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:41,281 line:-2
For example, if you're a white-noise app
such as Bedtime,


172
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:44,418 line:-2
a good phrase to use
would include the name of the track,


173
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,987 line:-1
such as "Play Counting Sleepy Dinosaurs."


174
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:51,959 line:-2
This name is descriptive enough to
stand out from your app's other actions,


175
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,561 line:-2
while being short enough
to fit on the lock screen.


176
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,265 line:-2
A phrase such as "Play sound"
is too generic


177
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,502 line:-2
and doesn't have any information
about the actual sound,


178
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,537 line:-1
making it hard to identify.


179
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,474 line:-2
Make sure to also limit
the length of the phrase


180
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,776 line:-1
by omitting unnecessary information


181
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,513 line:-2
to avoid truncation in places
with limited space.


182
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:17,117 line:-2
Now that you know how to choose
a great suggested invocation phrase,


183
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,585 line:-1
let's see how to do this in code.


184
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:24,558 line:-2
You can do this by simply setting the
suggested invocation phrase on the intent


185
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,160 line:-2
before donating
or suggesting the shortcut.


186
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:31,899 line:-2
As you can see, this phrase is displayed
on the lock screen during Wind Down


187
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,067 line:-1
and is used to name the shortcut,


188
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,236 line:-2
so it's important
to choose this carefully.


189
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,774 line:-2
To wrap up, we talked about
the new Wind Down experience


190
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,010 line:-1
and its integration with the Shortcuts app


191
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,280 line:-2
and how you can use new APIs
to make it super easy


192
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,349 line:-2
for actions from your app
to be a part of this experience.


193
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,118 line:-1
Thank you for watching, everyone.
