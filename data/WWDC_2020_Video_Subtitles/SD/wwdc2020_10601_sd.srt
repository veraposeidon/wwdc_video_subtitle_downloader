00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:07,074 line:-1
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,177 line:0
Hello, everyone.
My name is Philip Simmons,


3
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,478 line:0
a designer here at Apple.


4
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,981 line:0
Thank you so much for taking the time
to tune in for my talk


5
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,649 line:0
on the artist's AR toolkit.


6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,485 line:-2
So today my talk is gonna focus on
the artist's journey


7
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:22,122 line:-2
of creating compliant USDZs
for use in Reality Composer.


8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,893 line:-2
This will cover what file formats
you should export from your DCC,


9
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,462 line:-2
how to bring those assets
into Reality Converter,


10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,264 line:-1
and make them into USDZs.


11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,800 line:-2
Later, we'll look at using our assets
inside Reality Composer


12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,337 line:0
and setting up some complex behaviors
to create rich experiences.


13
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:42,442 line:0
Lastly we'll send all this data to device
and view our newly created AR project.


14
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:44,678 line:0
So what does all this look like?


15
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,881 line:0
So from a high level,
this is the journey we're gonna take.


16
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:52,019 line:0
It is a straight line from your DCC
of choice into Reality Converter,


17
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:56,123 line:0
then Reality Composer, and, lastly,
onto device for viewing and sharing.


18
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,260 line:0
So Reality Converter is a major step
in this process,


19
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:04,531 line:0
and we need to know a few things before
we can begin pushing data through it.


20
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,333 line:-1
So the primary things to note are gonna be


21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,137 line:-2
geometry types that can be imported
and the texture types that are supported.


22
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:16,176 line:0
So for geometry, we're gonna have
FBX, OBJ, USD and GLTF.


23
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,812 line:0
For textures, we have PNGs and JPEGs.


24
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,684 line:0
So these inputs combined allow
Reality Converter to output a valid USDZ.


25
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:27,254 line:-2
Since Reality Composer
only accepts USDZ files,


26
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:32,125 line:-2
Apple has provided the tools necessary for
developers to generate and inspect USDZs.


27
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,262 line:-2
So last year, Apple offered
a suite of Python-based tools


28
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,865 line:-2
so developers could get started
making their own content.


29
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,801 line:-2
This year, we're proud to be including
Reality Converter


30
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,903 line:-1
as a next generation in that tooling.


31
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,374 line:0
So both Reality Converter
and the USDZ tools are available today


32
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,643 line:0
through the developer.apple website.


33
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,313 line:-2
All right. So let's get started
generating some content.


34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,083 line:-2
We're going to look at a few examples
in different DCCs


35
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,719 line:-2
and send all that data over
to Reality Converter.


36
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:03,023 line:-2
So here, we're gonna begin by taking
a look at an asset inside Houdini


37
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,326 line:-2
and exporting it out as a USD for use
in Reality Converter.


38
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,663 line:-2
Now Houdini is known for
its powerful simulation tool set,


39
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,231 line:-1
and in this demonstration,


40
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,101 line:-2
I will be scratching the absolute surface
of that toolset


41
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:17,304 line:-2
to show you how we can take one asset,
instance it around,


42
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:21,642 line:-2
and export those instances out
as individuals in a hierarchy.


43
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,210 line:-1
Now this is an important distinction,


44
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,446 line:-2
because later I'm gonna show you
how to reach into that USDZ hierarchy


45
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,582 line:-2
and apply behaviors
directly to individuals


46
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,384 line:-1
instead of the asset as a whole.


47
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,021 line:-2
So let's take a look at
what I've set up here.


48
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,689 line:-1
Here I have the cloud geometry.


49
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,991 line:0
You can see it in the viewport
as we tumble around.


50
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,461 line:0
Now when we jump into the geometry node,
you can see what I've actually created.


51
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,330 line:0
Here I'm bringing the geometry
on the left,


52
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,332 line:0
and down the right-hand side
I've built a graph.


53
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,502 line:0
Now this graph is essentially
building a volume,


54
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,170 line:0
scattering particles throughout it,


55
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,240 line:0
and then instancing our cloud
at each one of those points.


56
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:56,243 line:0
So if we look further down the chain
what our combined result is,


57
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,146 line:0
I have clouds scattered
through this volume.


58
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,481 line:0
Now this is a live graph,
so I can jump back in


59
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,551 line:0
and update the scatter node
to have more or less points.


60
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,020 line:0
Here I'll drop the count
from ten to eight.


61
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,556 line:0
So, all together,
we can go ahead and start exporting.


62
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,226 line:0
So for export,
I'll jump over to the staging area.


63
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,328 line:0
Here I've set up a USD rot node.


64
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,664 line:0
This is being fed our instance geometry
and our particles.


65
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:21,401 line:0
Now I'm combining these in such a way
that keeps the instances in a hierarchy,


66
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,438 line:0
as opposed to merging it
as a solid piece of geometry.


67
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,875 line:0
So with my rot node set,
I can go ahead and save this to disk.


68
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,179 line:-1
So with our newly-exported asset,


69
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:36,216 line:-2
now is the perfect time to fire up
Reality Converter and get to know the app.


70
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,485 line:-2
We will go ahead
and begin with our cloud asset


71
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,888 line:-2
and get a feel
for how Converter's gonna work,


72
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,525 line:-2
and then we'll loop back and gather
the other asset types for conversion.


73
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,794 line:-1
So here we are with Converter loaded up.


74
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,864 line:-2
In Converter,
it starts with a blank scene,


75
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,499 line:-1
and it's asking you to drop the files.


76
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,567 line:-1
So let's do that.


77
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:57,538 line:-2
We'll navigate on disk
and find our cloud USD that we've created.


78
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,674 line:-2
Now we can simply drag and drop this
into the viewport


79
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,110 line:-1
and Converter will load up our asset.


80
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,178 line:-1
And here we are.


81
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,280 line:-1
With this asset loaded up,


82
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,615 line:-2
now is a great time
to take a tour through the software


83
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,884 line:-2
and get a feel for everything
it has to offer.


84
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,588 line:-2
So first and foremost,
we're in the 3D viewport.


85
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,423 line:-1
You can rotate, you can pan, you can zoom.


86
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,560 line:-2
Now down the left-hand side,
we're gonna have the Models tab.


87
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,398 line:-2
The Models tab will fill up
as you drag in more geometries.


88
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,034 line:-2
So once we fill this in
with our other geometries later on,


89
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,836 line:-1
you'll see how we can toggle between them.


90
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,040 line:-2
Now this is a 3D viewport, and sometimes
you can lose where you're at.


91
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,710 line:-2
So if you're playing around and you happen
to zoom away from where you want to be,


92
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,979 line:-2
we've given you a framing icon
to give it back.


93
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:43,250 line:-2
Now down the right-hand side is where
you're gonna do most of your work.


94
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:46,887 line:-2
Now the Environments tab is the tab
where we're giving you preloaded IBLs.


95
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,622 line:-1
That's image-based lighting.


96
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:52,426 line:-2
This is the lighting environments
that make your image look how they do.


97
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,997 line:-2
You can simply toggle between them,
and find ones that suit your needs.


98
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:58,732 line:-1
Now if they're too light or too dark,


99
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,934 line:-2
we're giving you exposure controls
down the bottom


100
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,669 line:-2
where you can
make adjustments accordingly.


101
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,640 line:-2
In addition, we're giving you
grid and environment views.


102
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,576 line:-2
Grid is perfect for knowing
how large your asset is


103
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,612 line:-1
in relation to a certain scale.


104
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,914 line:-2
So, example,
our grid units here are set to one meter.


105
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,984 line:-2
You can see that each checkbox
is going to be a meter large.


106
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,052 line:-1
You can also see the environment.


107
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,255 line:-1
This is representing what the IBL is.


108
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,023 line:-1
So the IBL looks like this,


109
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,059 line:-2
and in the 3D viewport,
it's gonna look like this.


110
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,028 line:-2
If you find that distracting,
you can simply turn it off


111
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,496 line:-1
and get back to a solid color.


112
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,434 line:-2
The Materials tab is where you're gonna
hook up all your materials and textures.


113
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,371 line:-2
Here you can see
we have two materials noted,


114
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,140 line:-2
but only one of them
I actually assigned to my DCC.


115
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,445 line:-2
Converter is giving you a default material
as a fallback nicety,


116
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,149 line:-2
so if you download something or you build
something and forget to assign a material,


117
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:53,020 line:-2
we've given you the fallback material
that will automatically assign on import.


118
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,890 line:-2
Now I've set up a material,
so I know I'm ready to go.


119
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,060 line:-2
We can simply add our textures
by dragging them from disk as well.


120
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,828 line:-1
So if we navigate the disk,


121
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,199 line:-2
we can find our base color
and drop it on our base color input.


122
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,401 line:-1
There we have it.


123
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,735 line:-2
We can go ahead
and fill in the rest of them.


124
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,538 line:-2
We have a normal map,
and we also have an ambient occlusion.


125
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,811 line:-2
And that's it. Our material is set up,
and our textures are added.


126
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,047 line:-2
So let's go ahead
and look at our last tab.


127
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,448 line:-1
Our Properties tab is important.


128
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,584 line:-2
This is where you're gonna add
your copyright information


129
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,419 line:-1
and also set up your base units.


130
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,653 line:-1
So for copyright information,


131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,223 line:-2
you want to let the world know
who made this asset.


132
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,291 line:-2
So we'll go ahead and tell them
Apple made it.


133
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,994 line:-1
Now base units is an important feature.


134
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,598 line:-2
I know because this asset came
from Houdini, it was built in meters.


135
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,834 line:-2
So I want Converter
to also export it in meters.


136
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,204 line:-2
Later on, we'll see assets
that were constructed in centimeters,


137
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,874 line:-2
and we'll go ahead and change it here
to be centimeters for export.


138
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,809 line:-1
So with that all set,


139
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:52,145 line:-2
we can jump back to our DCCs
and grab the rest of our assets.


140
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,383 line:-2
So now let's take a look at
an animated asset inside Maya


141
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,352 line:-1
and export it out as an FBX.


142
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:00,787 line:-1
So here we have a taxi.


143
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,893 line:-2
This asset has been modeled, textured
and animated inside Maya by an artist.


144
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,563 line:-2
So we accept both transform animation
as well as skinned animation.


145
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,967 line:-2
So this particular animation has been done
by keyframing directly on the geometry,


146
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,403 line:-1
so no rig or skin is actually needed.


147
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,505 line:-1
There we have it. We can hit play,


148
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,541 line:-2
and we can see it
bumbling around the viewport.


149
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,576 line:-2
Now let's take a moment
to talk about materials.


150
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:26,313 line:-2
Here in my viewport, you can see
I have assigned a shader with textures.


151
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,349 line:-2
We can look at the graph and see
where I've actually put that all together.


152
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,352 line:-2
Reality Converter doesn't care about
your texture inputs here.


153
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,355 line:-2
It cares about material names
and material assignments.


154
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:39,593 line:-2
So that I've hooked up textures here
is just a nicety for me in my own DCC.


155
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,430 line:-2
So long way of saying you don't need
to set up textures in your viewport


156
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,732 line:-1
to get a valid build in Converter.


157
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,302 line:-2
So with all this set
and we're happy with our asset,


158
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:51,371 line:-2
we can go ahead and export
as an FBX to disk.


159
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:55,642 line:-2
So on a quick technical note,
when using FBX you will need two things.


160
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,046 line:-2
So first you're gonna need
to have the FBX plug-ins enabled


161
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,048 line:-1
in your Maya plug-in preferences,


162
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,951 line:-2
and second, you're gonna have to have
the FBX Python bindings


163
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,619 line:-1
installed to your machine.


164
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:10,123 line:-2
Now those bindings are available for free
on the Autodesk website, seen here.


165
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:14,728 line:-2
So jumping back to our DCCs,
next we're gonna look at a static asset.


166
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,865 line:-2
Static assets are the most common
type of asset you will encounter,


167
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:22,603 line:-2
and OBJ is a very popular file format
to save static assets to.


168
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,806 line:-2
So nearly every DCC
is going to export to OBJ.


169
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:29,409 line:-2
And that's why you will often find this
as the available file type


170
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,512 line:-1
when downloading from online sources.


171
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,249 line:-2
So here inside Blender
we can take a look at a static asset.


172
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:39,586 line:-2
This school asset is comprised of
geometry, materials, and textures.


173
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,188 line:-2
So here in the viewport,
we can see the geometry.


174
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:46,026 line:0
Down below, we can see I have a material
hooked up with my texture inputs.


175
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:49,329 line:-2
And lastly, here are the UVs
that the textures are being powered by.


176
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,733 line:-2
So all that combined gives our final look
in the viewport.


177
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,168 line:-1
So, happy with our asset,


178
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,771 line:-2
we can go ahead and export this as an OBJ
and save it to disk.


179
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:01,475 line:-2
GLTF is our final geometry format
that we accept.


180
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:05,512 line:-2
More and more DCCs are starting
to pick it up as an export option,


181
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,181 line:-1
and KeyShot is one such app.


182
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,049 line:-1
So for our off-line render community,


183
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:14,755 line:-2
you can now easily move your data to
a real-time format through GLTF and USDZ.


184
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,359 line:-2
So here in KeyShot,
you can see the clock tower.


185
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,763 line:-2
Now like the OBJ example,
this is a static asset.


186
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:26,800 line:-2
So it'll have the same geometry,
materials and texture setup as before.


187
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,936 line:-2
Here we can select the geometry
in the hierarchy


188
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:32,005 line:-2
and see further down
I've assigned the material.


189
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,242 line:-2
So this material,
I have base colors and roughness assigned.


190
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,877 line:-1
Now if we inspect the material itself,


191
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,179 line:-2
you can see where
I've plugged in those textures,


192
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,249 line:-2
and all of this combined
is what's giving us our final render.


193
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,650 line:-1
So, happy with our asset again,


194
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:47,221 line:-2
we can go ahead and export this out
as a GLTF and save it to disk.


195
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,093 line:-2
So last topic before we go back
to Reality Converter


196
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,795 line:-1
is about downloaded content.


197
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:59,466 line:-2
As you can see, using DCCs is a complex
and specialized skill set.


198
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,236 line:-2
So for developers
that don't want to learn a DCC,


199
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:05,839 line:-2
or don't want to make their own art,
online resources are available.


200
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:10,143 line:-2
Some have even started offering USDZs
as a downloadable file type,


201
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,579 line:-2
which is perfect for use
in Reality Composer,


202
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,448 line:-1
Sketchfab being one such site.


203
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:16,917 line:-2
But for those times that you find
an asset online,


204
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:19,386 line:-1
and it's not offered in USDZ format,


205
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,222 line:-2
you now have the capability
to make it one yourself.


206
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:24,791 line:-1
So with our new content,


207
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,861 line:-2
let's get back into Reality Converter
and make some USDZs.


208
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,298 line:-2
So Converter's still up,
loaded and waiting for us.


209
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:34,535 line:-2
We can go ahead and navigate on disk
and find our assets.


210
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,236 line:-1
Now, the first time we did this,


211
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,239 line:-2
we dragged in the geometry
and in the texture separately.


212
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,307 line:-1
That was the long way.


213
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:41,775 line:-1
I'm gonna show you a faster way


214
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,644 line:-2
to get through this software
and get it done.


215
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,981 line:-2
So if you select at the folder level,
you can see I've exported out our geometry


216
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,683 line:-1
and our associated textures.


217
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:52,986 line:-2
Now if we just grab things
at the folder level,


218
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,422 line:-2
we can drag and drop that
directly into Converter,


219
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,224 line:-1
and it'll hook it all up for us.


220
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,292 line:-1
So let's do that.


221
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:07,668 line:-2
So here we can see, we have our taxi,
our clock tower and our schoolhouse.


222
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,303 line:-1
You can see down at the Models tab here


223
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,538 line:-2
that we've given affordance
for animated assets.


224
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,507 line:-2
So if you bring in an asset
that has animation,


225
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:15,442 line:-2
it's gonna get
this little running man icon.


226
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,478 line:-2
That's how you'll know at a glance
which one has animation.


227
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,681 line:-1
So to that end, in the viewport,


228
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:26,119 line:-2
we're gonna give you the ability to play,
pause and stop the animation.


229
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,156 line:-2
So if you hit play,
it'll simply loop endlessly.


230
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,826 line:-2
Now same as before, you can toggle through
your environment lightings


231
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,229 line:-2
if you want to view it
in different lighting setups.


232
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,064 line:-1
You can show the environment and grid.


233
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,299 line:-1
That also works. Same as before.


234
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,903 line:-2
So over to the important part,
we'll look at our properties.


235
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,805 line:-1
Properties, like we spoke about before,


236
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:48,075 line:-2
is where you add copyright information
and you set your base units.


237
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:52,980 line:-2
Now this important because we exported in
centimeters from our last DCC packages.


238
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,216 line:-2
Here in Converter,
we need to have that reflected.


239
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,252 line:-2
So we'll go ahead
and change him to centimeters,


240
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,154 line:-2
and we'll do the same
for the clock tower and the schoolhouse.


241
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,028 line:-1
Perfect.


242
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,864 line:-2
So there we go.
All our assets are in Converter,


243
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,367 line:-2
materials are hooked up,
textures are applied,


244
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,769 line:-2
all our units are set
and our copyrights are set.


245
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,704 line:-1
We can go ahead and export.


246
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,674 line:-2
Now you could export one at a time
and save it out to disk,


247
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,009 line:-1
but there's a faster way.


248
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,679 line:-2
We'll give you the affordance
to simply go file, export all,


249
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,948 line:-1
and you can do it all in one big push.


250
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:31,418 line:-2
So we'll find a nice place on disk
and hit export.


251
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:32,753 line:-1
Now once the export is complete,


252
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,522 line:-2
you'll get a little check mark
next to each one of the icons,


253
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,891 line:-2
and you'll know that
that process has been done.


254
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,093 line:-1
We can verify that by jumping to Finder,


255
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,963 line:-2
and we can now see our assets
here on disk.


256
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,633 line:-1
So with all our content in USDZ form,


257
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,635 line:-2
we're now good to go
with Reality Composer.


258
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:52,773 line:-2
We can simply spin up a project,
drag in our assets to be used.


259
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,074 line:-1
So let's start.


260
00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:56,443 line:-1
Jumping over to Reality Composer,


261
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,447 line:-2
we can bring up Finder and drag in
those assets that we just created.


262
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,149 line:-1
So here's where you would know immediately


263
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:05,185 line:-2
if your unit scales
were not set correctly in Converter.


264
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,688 line:-2
Everything is sitting nicely
with each other,


265
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,190 line:-2
and it's the right scale and proportion
to each other.


266
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,426 line:-1
If it wasn't exported at the right scale,


267
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:16,163 line:-2
some would be larger by 100X
or smaller by 100X.


268
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,866 line:-2
Here we can visually see
that everything is working fine.


269
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,271 line:-2
Now our schoolhouse and our clock tower
are static assets.


270
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:27,007 line:-2
So all we have to verify for them
is that they look nice.


271
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,178 line:-2
So we can go ahead and view them,
scroll around, and everything looks great.


272
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,850 line:-2
Now for our taxi, if we remember,
this is an animated asset.


273
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,086 line:-2
Now as we saw in Converter,
you can hit play,


274
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,456 line:-2
or in preview you can hit space bar,
and it'll automatically animate.


275
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,792 line:-2
In Composer,
we don't automatically animate for you.


276
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,928 line:-1
You tell it when you want it to animate.


277
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,630 line:-1
So let's take a look at how that works.


278
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,032 line:-1
We zoom in to our taxi.


279
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:53,934 line:-2
We'll make it a little bit larger
so we can see it.


280
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,172 line:0
With our taxi,
we're gonna need to use behaviors.


281
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,773 line:0
So let's make a new behavior.


282
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,213 line:0
So there's a plus sign, go to Custom.


283
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,281 line:0
We'll give it a trigger.


284
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,584 line:0
So I'm gonna tell it,
on Scene Start, do something.


285
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,085 line:0
So we'll select Scene Start,


286
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:16,056 line:0
and in our sequence,
we'll tell it to use a USDZ animation.


287
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,458 line:0
Now we need to target it.


288
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,428 line:0
Since I already had the taxi selected
when I built this behavior,


289
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:24,031 line:0
it automatically applied it
to the behavior.


290
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,600 line:0
So we don't even really need to target it.


291
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,802 line:0
Now we can hit space bar and simulate,


292
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,470 line:-1
and there we have our taxi moving.


293
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:34,074 line:-2
Now, by default, it goes one time
through the animation and stops.


294
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,243 line:0
I want this to loop endlessly.


295
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,512 line:0
So I'm gonna go ahead up here
at the action sequence,


296
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,013 line:0
and tell it to loop endlessly.


297
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,548 line:-1
Now, if we simulate again...


298
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,885 line:-1
our taxi's running, endlessly animating.


299
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:47,588 line:0
Perfect.


300
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,823 line:0
So let's take a look at our clouds.


301
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,359 line:-2
Our cloud asset, if we remember,
we set up specifically


302
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,394 line:-2
so we could get
at the individual entities.


303
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:56,496 line:-1
So let me show you how to do that.


304
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,266 line:0
If you select your clouds,
you can right-click


305
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,767 line:0
and get at Hierarchy Select.


306
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:04,471 line:0
Here's where you can expand the USD scene
that we've created.


307
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,608 line:0
And this is how you can get at
the individuals inside


308
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,243 line:0
and do individual things.


309
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,679 line:0
So with right-clicking
and doing Hierarchy Select,


310
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,249 line:0
I can move things around,
I can scale them,


311
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,318 line:0
and, more importantly,
I can apply behaviors to them.


312
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:23,724 line:0
Great.


313
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,392 line:-1
So with that understanding,


314
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,530 line:-2
let's take this all over and use it
in context of a real AR experience.


315
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,699 line:0
So if we go to our scenes,
I've already put one together.


316
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:37,738 line:-2
So here's a little town I put together
using our assets,


317
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,206 line:-1
in a more contextual way.


318
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,976 line:-2
If we hit simulate, you can see I've
already given it some ambient behaviors.


319
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,485 line:-2
So let's take a look at our taxi asset
to begin with.


320
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,054 line:-1
This particular taxi asset


321
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,657 line:-2
is slowly approaching,
driving down the street,


322
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:57,824 line:-1
and then disappearing.


323
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,893 line:-2
Now, what's really happening
under the hood


324
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,395 line:-1
is what this other one is doing.


325
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,364 line:-2
This other taxi is moving
from point A to point B,


326
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,433 line:-1
and then rewinding and doing it again.


327
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,669 line:-1
But that doesn't look so great.


328
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,138 line:-2
So let me show you
how to add those extra niceties


329
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:14,107 line:-2
to make this look
like a real smooth transition in,


330
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,845 line:-2
transition out, and a loop,
so as if it were ambient taxis


331
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,646 line:-1
coming and going through your scene.


332
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,883 line:0
So let's jump down to the Behaviors
and take a look.


333
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:29,523 line:0
In our sequence,
you can see I'm doing a move-to.


334
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,192 line:0
This is moving a taxi
from point A to point B.


335
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:35,462 line:0
Now, after that,
I'm simply giving it another move-to


336
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,564 line:0
to tell it to go back
to where it started from.


337
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,101 line:0
So we need to add a couple more cards here
to smooth out that transition.


338
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:44,638 line:0
So if we hit the plus sign,
we can pick a Show,


339
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,640 line:0
we can also pick a Hide.


340
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,944 line:-2
Now, behaviors are evaluated
left to right.


341
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:53,413 line:-2
So we're going to need to
move these cards into position


342
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,915 line:-1
so that they function correctly.


343
00:16:54,982 --> 00:16:57,484 line:0
So I'll select my Show card,
and move it to the beginning,


344
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:59,753 line:0
'cause that's the first thing
I want it to do.


345
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,457 line:0
Of course, we'll choose our asset
that we want it to be triggered at.


346
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,224 line:0
We're also going to want to hide it.


347
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:09,596 line:0
So our Hide is not the last thing we do.
It's actually the third to last thing.


348
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:11,198 line:0
So we're going to put it in place.


349
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,768 line:0
Then again, choose,
and assign it to the taxi.


350
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:17,171 line:-2
Now, let's take a look
at what that did for us.


351
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,839 line:-1
Fades in, it drives,


352
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,009 line:-2
and once it gets to the end
it's going to fade out,


353
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,277 line:-1
and rewind itself.


354
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,045 line:-2
But it doesn't quite
look like the other one.


355
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:30,250 line:0
That is because Show and Hide cards
have different ways of showing and hiding.


356
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,019 line:0
And that's an important distinction.


357
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,521 line:0
So let's scroll down a bit further
and check out their options.


358
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,156 line:0
If we give it a motion type,


359
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,926 line:0
we can tell at what direction
we want it to appear from.


360
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,361 line:0
So let's try Move from Front.


361
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:44,264 line:0
Now, I don't actually know
what direction that's going to go,


362
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,832 line:0
so that's why we have
these little play buttons.


363
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:49,369 line:0
And we can check and see
what this card does in context.


364
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,771 line:0
So I hit Play.


365
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:52,439 line:0
And it got lucky.


366
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,041 line:0
So let's take it.


367
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:57,144 line:0
So we can change the duration for how long
we want it to take to show up.


368
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:58,345 line:0
Let's say two seconds.


369
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:02,416 line:0
We can also tell it how far
we want it to go to show up.


370
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,885 line:0
So let's say something
like 25 centimeters.


371
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:10,591 line:0
And again, we can preview it
to see if that looks about right.


372
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:11,658 line:0
And perfect.


373
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,894 line:-1
So last note on the card,


374
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:15,662 line:-2
we're going to want to change
the animation type.


375
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:18,165 line:-2
We don't want to ease in
and come to a stop


376
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:19,833 line:-1
before the next card takes over.


377
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,971 line:-2
We want it to ease in and then continue on
into the next animated card.


378
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:27,207 line:0
So we're going to change its easing type
to simply be Ease In.


379
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,310 line:0
And then, we're going to let the next card
have no easing type.


380
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:33,447 line:0
So it just smoothly transitions
across the whole thing.


381
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:36,517 line:0
For the Hide Out,
we're going to do the exact same thing.


382
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,553 line:0
Whereas this one was Move to Front,
this one will be Move to Rear.


383
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:42,623 line:0
We'll change it to have the same time.


384
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:44,558 line:0
And the same distance.


385
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,831 line:0
There we go.


386
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,399 line:0
And on this easing type,
we'll do Ease Out,


387
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,334 line:0
since it's slowly leaving the scene.


388
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:57,604 line:0
Now if we hit Play, we should have
something a little more similar


389
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:59,840 line:-2
to what the other taxis are already
set up and doing.


390
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:03,177 line:-1
It gets to the end.


391
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:06,346 line:-1
It will smoothly drive off and disappear.


392
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,882 line:-2
It will then rewind itself,
and begin again.


393
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,751 line:-1
Perfect.


394
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,654 line:-2
So that's the basic concept
of making something show,


395
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:16,223 line:-1
move, hide, and repeat itself.


396
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,627 line:-2
We can build on these basic concepts to
make something a little bit more complex.


397
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,329 line:0
Let's take a look at this police car.


398
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,766 line:-1
This police car shows up, and moves.


399
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,634 line:-1
Exactly how we did our taxi.


400
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:31,271 line:-2
Now, when we get to the end of the street,
he's going to make a turn.


401
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:34,608 line:-2
This turn is a little bit more complex
to set up


402
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,476 line:-2
than just telling it to go
from point A to point B,


403
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:39,446 line:-2
because that would be a linear move,
and we want it to do an arc.


404
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:40,814 line:0
So let's check it out.


405
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,784 line:0
If we scroll down here
to the police car's sequence,


406
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:47,487 line:0
we can see I'm doing a show, a move,
just like we had before,


407
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,523 line:-2
now, I'm going to do an orbit
and another move.


408
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,757 line:-1
Now, what am I orbiting?


409
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:55,028 line:0
I'm orbiting a tiny piece of geometry
that I have hidden inside another area.


410
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,398 line:0
So an Orbit card is going to require you
to have an affected object,


411
00:19:58,465 --> 00:19:59,833 line:0
and a center object.


412
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,369 line:0
So if I move this building,
you can take a quick look,


413
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:04,571 line:0
I have a pill hidden inside this building.


414
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:07,541 line:0
That is what I'm using
as its area to orbit.


415
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,177 line:0
Let's go ahead and put our building back.


416
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:11,879 line:0
And you can see how that works.


417
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,916 line:-2
The car drives,
once it gets to the end of the street,


418
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:20,420 line:-2
he's going to then orbit that pill .25,
because I don't want to do a full circle,


419
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:21,755 line:-1
just a simple turn.


420
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:24,591 line:-2
And then, another Move To card
is going to take over.


421
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:28,328 line:-2
And we'll have a Hide card at the end
to make it disappear, same as the taxi.


422
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,865 line:-2
So that's an easy way
to take a simple behavior


423
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:34,001 line:-2
such as, like, showing,
and moving, and hiding,


424
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,236 line:-2
and giving a couple extra cards
in the middle


425
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:39,206 line:-2
to create a more rich
and convincing environment.


426
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,108 line:-1
So let's take a look at our clouds.


427
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,178 line:-2
Like we did before,
we can select individual clouds


428
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,646 line:-1
and make them do different things.


429
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,047 line:-1
This would look a little funny


430
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:49,616 line:-2
if all the clouds simply moved
on their own.


431
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,418 line:-1
So let's check out what I've built.


432
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,090 line:0
In this behavior, I'm using
the same gimmick of Show and Hide


433
00:20:57,157 --> 00:21:01,728 line:0
where I'm telling it to show a cloud,
come in on a slow transition,


434
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:03,597 line:-1
and then hide out on a slow transition.


435
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:07,601 line:0
And if we view this sequence,
we can see our clouds are doing just that.


436
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:12,439 line:0
Now, that's great
and looks very convincing.


437
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:13,974 line:0
But I want them all to do it.


438
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,443 line:0
So let's hit Stop,
and let's apply more behaviors.


439
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:18,679 line:0
Now, where I want them all to do it,


440
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,948 line:0
I want them all to do it
at different rates.


441
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:23,483 line:0
So instead of building a new behavior
over and over again,


442
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,519 line:0
we can simply duplicate a behavior...


443
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:30,757 line:0
and re-target the cards
to different clouds.


444
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:34,294 line:0
So let's go ahead and do a Choose,
and instead of targeting these again,


445
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,463 line:0
we'll pick this guy here in the back.


446
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,033 line:0
And of course,
we'll do it again for the Hide.


447
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,106 line:0
And we can change its timing
to be something a little bit longer.


448
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,242 line:0
Maybe 15, and 15.


449
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:53,013 line:0
And let's simulate and see what that did.


450
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:57,084 line:-2
So now you can see my groups of clouds
coming and going.


451
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,387 line:-2
I have three different cloud behaviors
targeting different groups of clouds,


452
00:22:00,454 --> 00:22:02,756 line:-2
and they're moving and going
at different rates.


453
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:05,993 line:-1
Perfect.


454
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:10,297 line:0
So with all that set up,
now's a good time to talk about context.


455
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:13,500 line:-1
Viewing AR is great in context.


456
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,335 line:-1
So we need to know how big are things?


457
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:18,605 line:-2
Are things moving quickly or slowly
in your actual world?


458
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,375 line:-1
So this is where we have the iOS Handoff.


459
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:25,112 line:-1
So here, on Mac OS, I can hit Edit on iOS


460
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,481 line:-1
and I can drop this project to my iPad.


461
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:32,419 line:-2
Then, on my iPad, make edits in context
and drop it back to my Mac OS.


462
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:33,720 line:-1
So let's give that a shot.


463
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,528 line:-2
So here on the Mac OS,
we can simply do Edit on iOS...


464
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:45,832 line:-2
and with Reality Composer launched,
you'll see our iPad show up.


465
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,634 line:-1
Now, we can do the Handoff.


466
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,937 line:-1
So we'll simply click ourselves,


467
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:51,738 line:-1
and Accept on the iPad.


468
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:53,574 line:-1
Now, it's transferring the project


469
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,143 line:-2
all the way over to my iPad
for me to make edits.


470
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,345 line:-2
So we'll simply wait for it to sync,
and we'll be good to go.


471
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:00,714 line:-1
So here we go.


472
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:02,482 line:-2
We've transferred our file
over to our iPad.


473
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,685 line:-2
Now, we can view
and edit things in context.


474
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:08,555 line:-2
So here on iPad, we can see
we have the Reality Composer app running,


475
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:09,690 line:-1
and our project loaded.


476
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:11,692 line:-1
We can simulate here in the View port,


477
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,727 line:-2
and we can see everything
that we had set up on the Mac


478
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:15,295 line:-1
is working here on the iOS.


479
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,600 line:-2
Now, the power of working on iOS
is that we can drop this into our world,


480
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,068 line:-1
and edit in real time.


481
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:23,537 line:-2
So let's go ahead and hit
the AR affordance here in the corner.


482
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:26,940 line:-2
And we can target our table
and drop our scene down.


483
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,910 line:-2
Now, with our scene placed
in the real world,


484
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:31,545 line:-1
we can hit Play again,


485
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:33,480 line:-1
and we can view things in context.


486
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:35,115 line:-1
There goes our little police car.


487
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,150 line:-1
And here are our clouds coming and going.


488
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:38,652 line:-1
And there's our taxis moving.


489
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:42,523 line:-2
Now, let's say I'm not happy
with the rate something is moving.


490
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:46,293 line:-2
I can simply hit Stop,
and I can jump over to the Behaviors tab.


491
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,061 line:-1
Let's grab our taxi here.


492
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:50,430 line:0
And we can change
the rate at which things show up.


493
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:52,399 line:0
And let's say on taxi number two,


494
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:55,035 line:0
I would like it to show up
a little bit slower.


495
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,704 line:-1
I can change that from two to five.


496
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:01,441 line:-1
And we're set. We can hit Play again.


497
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,278 line:-2
And we'll view that that takes now
five seconds for it to show up


498
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:05,779 line:-1
at a very slow pace.


499
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,415 line:-2
Now, happy with the changes
that we've made,


500
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,050 line:-1
we can stop simulating,


501
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,318 line:-1
drop out of AR mode,


502
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:13,420 line:-1
and simply hit Done in the top corner.


503
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:16,456 line:-2
That passes the project back
to your Mac OS.


504
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:20,427 line:-2
Once back in Mac OS,
we can view that our behavior is updated


505
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:23,030 line:-2
with the changes that we made
on our iOS project.


506
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:25,933 line:-2
So if we navigate here,
and see that that five-second change


507
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:28,101 line:-1
translated across for us smoothly.


508
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:31,004 line:-2
Once happy, you can save it
and export it all out.


509
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:34,007 line:-2
Let's hit one more topic
before we export all this.


510
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:36,310 line:-2
I want to teach you how
to make a splash page


511
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:37,678 line:-1
for your AR experience.


512
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:39,513 line:-1
Now, when using AR Quick Look,


513
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,049 line:-2
there is a load time
while it syncs and anchors.


514
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:45,485 line:-2
While that's happening,
you view a scene of your content.


515
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:47,988 line:-2
I'm going to teach you how to make
a nice scene there


516
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:50,457 line:-2
for people to see
while they wait for it to load.


517
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:53,293 line:-2
Now, the fastest way in Reality Composer
to do that


518
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,895 line:-1
is to duplicate everything,


519
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:56,763 line:0
and remove what you don't want seen.


520
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,498 line:0
Let me show you how that works.


521
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:00,367 line:0
Here, we can do a Select All.


522
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,002 line:0
And Copy.


523
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:05,138 line:0
Now, on our Scenes tab,
we'll go ahead and make a new scene.


524
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:07,341 line:-1
So we'll go ahead and remove this one.


525
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:09,176 line:-1
We'll build a new one.


526
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:15,949 line:-1
There we go.


527
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,418 line:-2
Now, with a clean scene,
we can just Paste,


528
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:21,688 line:-2
and all our geometry is coming
from our other scene into this one.


529
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:24,791 line:-2
Now, what did not come along
is the behaviors.


530
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,294 line:0
So if we look at the behaviors,
everything is gone.


531
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,029 line:0
We simply have a static scene.


532
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:31,798 line:0
And that's fine. That is what we want.


533
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:34,535 line:0
So here,
I'm going to give it one behavior.


534
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:36,537 line:0
So let's go ahead and do a Custom,


535
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:38,405 line:0
On Scene Start...


536
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:42,409 line:0
and we're going to give it a Change Scene.


537
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,113 line:0
We'll choose our completed scene,
and we're good to go.


538
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,950 line:-2
So what this is doing is,
when the scene is loading,


539
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:51,618 line:-1
this is what you view.


540
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:54,821 line:-2
But when it drops down on your table,
and the scene actually starts,


541
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:58,125 line:-2
it immediately jumps over to our scene
with the animated traffic,


542
00:25:58,192 --> 00:25:59,393 line:-1
and the moving clouds.


543
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,728 line:-2
So this, in a sense,
is making a splash page


544
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:04,331 line:-2
for people to look at
while your content is loading.


545
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,568 line:0
So while we're here,
if we don't want to view certain things,


546
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:10,871 line:0
like I don't want to view the taxi,
or I don't want to view the clouds,


547
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:14,308 line:0
you can simply remove them,
and that comes off the splash page.


548
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:17,678 line:-2
But when we simulate,
it immediately jumps to the page,


549
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,214 line:-2
that has all the actual behaviors
and animations.


550
00:26:21,982 --> 00:26:22,983 line:0
Perfect.


551
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:24,885 line:-1
So our project is essentially done.


552
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:27,554 line:-2
Now, let's talk about exporting
and sending to device.


553
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:30,490 line:-2
New to Reality Composer,
we're going to give you the option


554
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:32,559 line:-1
to export out as a USDZ.


555
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:35,429 line:-2
Now, where before we were only giving you
the Reality Export,


556
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:37,231 line:-1
this is a new option for you


557
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:39,666 line:-2
that you'll need to enable
in your preferences.


558
00:26:42,636 --> 00:26:43,904 line:-1
So if we open our Preferences tab,


559
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:47,074 line:-2
you can see Enable USDZ Export
as an option.


560
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:50,277 line:-2
Now, you're asking,
"What's the difference?"


561
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:51,912 line:-1
The difference is going to be contextual


562
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:54,314 line:-2
based on what you want to do
with your project.


563
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:56,583 line:-2
So if you're looking to embed it
in a website,


564
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,418 line:-1
or put it in a News article,


565
00:26:58,485 --> 00:27:00,454 line:-1
you're going to want to use a USD export.


566
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:03,690 line:-2
Now, if you want to use it
in an Xcode project,


567
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:05,192 line:-1
or you want to use it with AR Quick Look,


568
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,694 line:-2
you're going to want to
stick with the Reality export.


569
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,663 line:-1
Now, I want to view this in AR Quick Look,


570
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,099 line:-2
so I'm going to stick
with the Reality export.


571
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:14,034 line:-1
Let's do a File.


572
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:15,102 line:-1
Export,


573
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:17,571 line:-2
and we'll save this to disk
as a Reality File.


574
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:25,979 line:-2
So with our new exported file,
we can go ahead and AirDrop that


575
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:28,081 line:-1
onto our device for viewing and sharing.


576
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,249 line:-1
So let's do that.


577
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:32,986 line:-2
I can select my Reality export,
I can right-click and do Share,


578
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:34,488 line:-1
AirDrop.


579
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:40,360 line:-2
Now, once our device comes up,
we can send it to ourselves.


580
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,668 line:-2
Great.
So we see it pop up here on our iPad.


581
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:50,437 line:-2
We can go ahead and accept it,
and save it to our files.


582
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:52,239 line:-1
Now, with it saved in our files,


583
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:54,641 line:-2
it'll automatically launch
in AR Quick Look,


584
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,276 line:-1
and drop it onto our desk.


585
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:00,614 line:-2
And once it loads,
our town should be here.


586
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,019 line:-1
Perfect.


587
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:12,793 line:-2
So that's the overall workflow using
Reality Converter and Reality Composer.


588
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,630 line:0
We have seen how we can take geometries
from a variety of DCCs


589
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:20,133 line:0
and using Reality Converter
make them into USDZs.


590
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,737 line:0
We then took those USDZs into Composer
and created an AR experience


591
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,239 line:0
with simple behavior set ups.


592
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:27,774 line:0
From that, we sent it all over
to AR Quick Look


593
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:29,476 line:0
to view, enjoy, and share.


594
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:33,113 line:-2
Now, this is all in service
of building great AR experiences


595
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,015 line:-1
that are lightweight and easily shareable.


596
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:36,283 line:-1
So with these tools,


597
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,485 line:-2
you now can create
even more compelling content


598
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,287 line:-1
for your experience.


599
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:43,290 line:-2
Moving forward from this talk,
you might find yourself with questions,


600
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:45,726 line:-2
or wanting to know more
on topics that I touched on.


601
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,996 line:0
Here are some great resources
to help you dive deeper


602
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,531 line:0
on the topics we discussed.


603
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:52,432 line:0
If you are new to Reality Composer,


604
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:55,135 line:0
I encourage you to check out
the Apple YouTube video


605
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:57,137 line:0
that gives an overview of the software.


606
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:59,139 line:0
Now, for Reality Converter,
you can download the app


607
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:02,042 line:0
from the developer's site
and check out the documentation.


608
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:05,045 line:0
And for Xcode projects
that leverage Reality Composer


609
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:07,948 line:0
you can view the samples
under the RealityKit section.


610
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:11,718 line:-2
Thank you so much
for taking the time to view my talk today.


611
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:15,355 line:-2
I really hope you found it fun,
informative, and inspiring.


612
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,224 line:-2
So I look forward to seeing
all the great content


613
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,927 line:-2
and experiences Reality Converter
and Reality Composer


614
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:21,295 line:-1
will enable you to create.


615
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:22,362 line:-1
I am Philip Simmons,


616
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:24,765 line:-2
and this has been a look
at the Artist AR Toolkit.


617
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:26,266 line:-1
Thank you. Bye-bye.
