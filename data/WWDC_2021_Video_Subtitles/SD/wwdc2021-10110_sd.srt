3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,812 line:-2
[Katherine] Hello.
My name is Katherine Nepo.


4
00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.514 line:-1 align:center
I'm a program manager


5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,550 line:-2
with the App Store Trust
and Safety team.


6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,053 line:-2
In this video, my colleague
Jeremy Stober and I


7
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,322 line:-2
will show you
how to safeguard your


8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,392 line:-2
accounts,
promotions, and content.


9
00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.562 line:-2 align:center
Today, we will discuss
the importance of designing


10
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:32,132 line:-2
for trust and safety
and present a suite of tools


11
00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:34.601 line:-2 align:center
that you can use
to protect your apps


12
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,804 line:-2
and your
customers from attackers.


13
00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.073 line:-2 align:center
Jeremy will walk you
through account risks


14
00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.876 line:-1 align:center
and promotion abuse.


15
00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:46.980 line:-2 align:center
I will close by talking
about content risks.


16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,484 line:-2
The Apple platform is designed
to help your business


17
00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:55.122 line:-2 align:center
grow and thrive with experiences
that are trusted, safe,


18
00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:58.759 line:-2 align:center
and fair
for you and your customers.


19
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,628 line:-2
We're going to review
how Sign in with Apple


20
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,164 line:-2
brings the simplicity
and security


21
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,467 line:-2
of two-factor
authentication to your app.


22
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,571 line:-2
We will then learn how you
can protect promotions


23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,173 line:-2
and offers and defend
the integrity of your


24
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,009 line:-2
app with DeviceCheck
and App Attest.


25
00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.780 line:-2 align:center
Your features are exciting
to your customers


26
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,250 line:-2
and may be
attractive to attackers.


27
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.452 line:-2 align:center
If your app includes
the ability to create


28
00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:29.356 line:-2 align:center
and manage accounts,
supports user-generated content,


29
00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:33.927 line:-2 align:center
offers promotional pricing,
or includes premium content,


30
00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:37.598 line:-2 align:center
it may be a target
for fraud and abuse.


31
00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:40.100 line:-2 align:center
There are many types
of abuse that can happen


32
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.969 line:-1 align:center
after you publish your app.


33
00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.538 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a closer
look at three of them.


34
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,575 line:-1
In many app experiences,


35
00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:52.412 line:-2 align:center
accounts are used to protect
users' assets.


36
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,617 line:-2
Attackers, eager to gain access,
seek new ways to take


37
00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:59.620 line:-2 align:center
over customer accounts
and steal their data.


38
00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:04.858 line:-2 align:center
If your app offers promotions,
you may be targeted by


39
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,362 line:-2
attackers seeking to take
advantage of your discounts


40
00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:12.499 line:-2 align:center
or otherwise manipulate
your app or server.


41
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,369 line:-2
These attackers can be
opportunistic individuals


42
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:18,238 line:-1
or large-scale operations.


43
00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:22.910 line:-2 align:center
Attackers can scrape servers
for valuable content and steal


44
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.481 line:-2 align:center
legitimate apps to modify,
repackage, and resell them


45
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:32,152 line:-2
outside of the App Store,
which can impact your business.


46
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:35.222 line:-2 align:center
I will now turn it over
to Jeremy to talk about your


47
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,725 line:-2
account risks and how you
can protect your users.


48
00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.094 line:-1 align:center
[Jeremy] Thank you, Katherine.


49
00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.130 line:-2 align:center
I'll begin by talking
about account risks


50
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,333 line:-2
that you should be aware
of as an app developer.


51
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:51,839 line:-2
Many apps and services require
customers to create accounts.


52
00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.441 line:-2 align:center
However,
several problems can arise


53
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,910 line:-1
from managing customer accounts.


54
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.446 line:-2 align:center
For example,
there is an incentive


55
00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:02.516 line:-2 align:center
for others to compromise
the security of your


56
00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.651 line:-1 align:center
customers' valuable accounts.


57
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,921 line:-2
Accounts can be taken over
through no fault of yours.


58
00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.824 line:-2 align:center
Your users might be
vulnerable to sophisticated


59
00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:14.027 line:-2 align:center
phishing attacks,
have their passwords leaked


60
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,064 line:-1
from unaffiliated services,


61
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,534 line:-2
or be the victim
of misplaced trust.


62
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,203 line:-2
According to the Anti-phishing
Working Group,


63
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.439 line:-1 align:center
an international consortium,


64
00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.774 line:-2 align:center
the number of reported phishing
attacks


65
00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:33.146 line:-2 align:center
observed by its members
doubled over the course of 2020.


66
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,249 line:-2
Since user accounts are
valuable,


67
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,217 line:-1
attackers may target them.


68
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,189 line:-2
In addition to account
compromises, if you use customer


69
00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.959 line:-2 align:center
feedback in your app,
for example, to power a ratings


70
00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.095 line:-1 align:center
or recommendation system,


71
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,030 line:-1
you may be creating a situation


72
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.367 line:-2 align:center
where that feedback can be
used for illicit gain.


73
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,968 line:-1
This might incentivize


74
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,137 line:-1
the creation of high volumes


75
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,239 line:-1
of fake accounts that are used


76
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.175 line:-1 align:center
to manipulate these systems.


77
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:04,378 line:0
Fake account creations can
overload infrastructure,


78
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,482 line:0
disrupt user experience, and
impact the overall authenticity


79
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:12,419 align:center
of the app experience
you are working hard to craft.


80
00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:16.590 line:-2 align:center
There are other forms
of abuse that can arise


81
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,426 line:-2
from inauthentic account
creation.


82
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,729 line:-2
For example, if users
can communicate with each other,


83
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,433 line:-2
then there may be an incentive
to send unsolicited advertising


84
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:31,338 line:-2
over the platform you create
using fake accounts.


85
00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:34.041 line:-2 align:center
This can adversely impact
the customer experience


86
00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:36.109 line:-1 align:center
and your reputation.


87
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,080 align:center
Apple offers a few tools
that developers can use


88
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,583 align:center
to better
manage account risks.


89
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,285 line:0
One method to avoid a number
of issues with account


90
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,722 line:0
management is to adopt
Sign in with Apple.


91
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,624 line:0
Integrating with
Sign in with Apple will


92
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,993 align:center
allow you to benefit
from Apple's robust


93
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:56,563 line:0
and ongoing efforts to keep
customer accounts secure.


94
00:04:56.563 --> 00:04:59.066 line:-2 align:center
Sign in with Apple is
protected by Apple's


95
00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:00.968 line:-1 align:center
two-factor authentication.


96
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,770 line:-2
Customers on Apple devices
can sign in


97
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,008 line:-2
and re-authenticate with Face
ID or Touch ID any time.


98
00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:10.711 line:-2 align:center
The benefits to integrating
with Sign in with Apple


99
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:12.679 line:-1 align:center
are not limited to security.


100
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,750 line:-2
The credential return on first
authorization includes


101
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,953 line:-2
a flag that indicates with
a high degree confidence


102
00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:22.923 line:-2 align:center
that a user is real
and not a bot.


103
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,693 line:-2
This flag
can be checked on the client.


104
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,997 line:-2
If a flag indicates
a user is likely real,


105
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,367 line:-2
no additional challenge
is needed.


106
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,403 line:-2
However,
if the platform is unsupported,


107
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,540 line:-2
or the value returned
is unknown, a challenge


108
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,544 line:-2
to the user is recommended
to prevent scripted traffic.


109
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:47,481 line:-2
To provide this flag,
Apple uses a private, secure,


110
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:51,385 line:-2
on-device machine learning model
in combination with


111
00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:55.255 line:-2 align:center
service side inferences
based on account activity.


112
00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:57.824 line:-2 align:center
With Sign in with Apple,
you can take advantage


113
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,793 line:-1
of Apple's world-class security


114
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:03,697 line:-2
and industry-leading
antifraud protections.


115
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,300 line:-2
If you are not using
Sign in with Apple,


116
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,801 line:0
there are a number of tools


117
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,903 align:center
that you can use to improve


118
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,772 align:center
account security and prevent


119
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,675 align:center
inauthentic account creations.


120
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,110 line:0
There are several
videos describing ways


121
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,113 align:center
to encourage strong
and unique passwords


122
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,883 align:center
without
increasing user friction.


123
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,453 line:0
Watch "One tap account
security upgrades"


124
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,455 line:0
and "Autofill everywhere"


125
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:29,489 align:center
for more information.


126
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,228 align:center
For inauthentic account
creation, prevention means


127
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,264 line:0
making risk-based decisions
using the data


128
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:41,268 line:0
you are able to collect from
the account creation request


129
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,805 align:center
like email domain
and other account details


130
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,940 align:center
that may be part
of your sign-up flow.


131
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,778 line:0
As part of your strategy,
you may want to limit the number


132
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:56,183 line:0
of account creations that can
happen on a single Apple device.


133
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,652 align:center
Limiting account creation
on physical devices


134
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,554 line:0
will make it more difficult


135
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,857 align:center
to create large numbers
of fake accounts.


136
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,693 align:center
Apple offers an API
called DeviceCheck


137
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,896 align:center
that can help with this.


138
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,864 line:0
Using this API,
you can effectively


139
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:15,035 line:0
limit account creations
on authentic Apple devices.


140
00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:17.437 line:-2 align:center
You may be promoting
your business with free


141
00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.407 line:-1 align:center
or discounted items in your app.


142
00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:23.877 line:-2 align:center
Next, I'll talk about an example
of how this can be abused.


143
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,015 line:-2
Suppose you want to offer
an in-app promotion


144
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,083 line:-1
to grow your business.


145
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,653 line:-2
Depending on the type of app,
this could be anything


146
00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:35.589 line:-2 align:center
from a free sandwich
to a discounted trial.


147
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:39.359 line:-2 align:center
You may find, however, that
uptake of the special offer


148
00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:43.230 line:-2 align:center
comes at a cost, as some
people abuse the promotion


149
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,166 line:-2
by re-downloading the app
multiple times.


150
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.903 line:-2 align:center
Using the DeviceCheck API,
you can


151
00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:53.407 line:-2 align:center
limit the number of promotion
redemptions per device


152
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,909 line:-1
while protecting user privacy.


153
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,813 line:-2
The service allows you to set
two bits of information


154
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:03.016 line:-2 align:center
on each device in a way
that's strongly tied


155
00:08:03.016 --> 00:08:06.787 line:-2 align:center
to device authenticity
and that can be read back


156
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:09,890 line:-2
even after a complete
reset of the device.


157
00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:14.061 line:-2 align:center
At a high level, the use
of DeviceCheck will allow you


158
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:18.765 line:-2 align:center
to verify that the device is
real and allow you to query


159
00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:23.170 line:-2 align:center
previously set values
of the two permitted bits.


160
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.306 line:-2 align:center
You have the ability
to set and change the bits


161
00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:28.709 line:-1 align:center
as you please.


162
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,979 line:-2
In the case of a free promotion,
you can use the value


163
00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:34.915 line:-2 align:center
of the return bits
to determine if the device


164
00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:38.452 line:-2 align:center
has been used to redeem
the promotion in the past.


165
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:41,255 line:-2
You can also choose to set
the bits per device


166
00:08:41.255 --> 00:08:43.857 line:-1 align:center
on account creation instead,


167
00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.527 line:-2 align:center
which would offer
a robust new signal


168
00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:49.863 line:-2 align:center
tied to verified hardware
that you can use


169
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:53.066 line:-2 align:center
in rate limiting account
creation in your app.


170
00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:58.705 line:-2 align:center
After a period of time, you can
choose to reset the bits.


171
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,108 line:-2
This will facilitate
reuse of the promotion


172
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:04,611 line:-2
on a time period that you
control and could help


173
00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:07.581 line:-2 align:center
manage situations
where devices change hands.

Katherine will now talk about


179
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,030 line:0
ways to protect your content


180
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,999 line:0
and APIs from
inauthentic clients.

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:27.935 line:-1 align:center
[Katherine] Thank you, Jeremy.


182
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,703 line:-2
Let's walk
through some of the risks


183
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,005 line:-2
potentially posed
to your content.


184
00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:35.843 line:-1 align:center
Your content is valuable


185
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:39,046 line:-2
and may be an attractive
target for attackers.


186
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,748 line:-2
An attacker
can develop and distribute


187
00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:45.786 line:-2 align:center
unauthorized software
that allows unpermitted access


188
00:09:45.786 --> 00:09:48.789 line:-1 align:center
to your app's premium content.


189
00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:52.459 line:-2 align:center
This illicit access may
negatively impact your earnings


190
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:57,564 line:-2
and create opportunities
for cheating and deception.


191
00:09:57.564 --> 00:10:01.268 line:-2 align:center
Such abuses may undermine
the trust of your users


192
00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:03.770 line:-2 align:center
and ultimately harm
your business.


193
00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:06.940 line:-2 align:center
To help
you protect the integrity


194
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.644 line:-2 align:center
of your app experiences,
we created App Attest,


195
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,980 line:-1
which provides app protection


196
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.885 line:-2 align:center
starting with iOS 14
and tvOS 15.


197
00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:20.721 line:-1 align:center
App Attest enables you to verify


198
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:23.290 line:-2 align:center
that the apps connecting
to your servers


199
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.493 line:-2 align:center
are the apps that you
published on the App Store,


200
00:10:26.493 --> 00:10:30.664 line:-2 align:center
unmodified and running
on genuine Apple devices.


201
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,169 line:-2
Leveraging Apple's secure
enclave processor,


202
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:40,274 line:-2
iOS and tvOS generate
a cryptographic attestation


203
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:44,144 line:-2
of your app's identity which you
can send to your server


204
00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:48.415 line:-2 align:center
for verification before making
your critical assets available.


205
00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:50.951 line:-1 align:center
App Attest is easy to use.


206
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:54,721 line:-2
With only a few exchanges
between your app and your server


207
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,857 align:center
you can verify the identity


208
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,893 line:0
of the app requesting
your content.


209
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,196 align:center
For more information
on App Attest,


210
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:03,730 line:0
including how your server


211
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,465 line:0
can perform verification,


212
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,967 line:0

215
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,375 line:-2
The tools we discussed
today will enable you


216
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,313 line:-2
to guard your apps,
your users, and your content.


217
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:22,850 line:-2
Implement Sign in with Apple
to secure your accounts from


218
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.753 line:-2 align:center
attackers and prevent access
to your valuable data.


219
00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:31.692 line:-2 align:center
Use DeviceCheck to prevent abuse
of your promotional offerings.


220
00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:33.126 line:-1 align:center
And protect your content


221
00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:35.629 line:-1 align:center
with App Attest by validating


222
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:37.564 line:-1 align:center
the authenticity of the apps


223
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,399 line:-1
connecting to your server


224
00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:41.835 line:-1 align:center
before serving their requests.


225
00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:43.370 line:-1 align:center
Thank you for watching.


226
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,873 line:-2
We look forward to seeing
your businesses grow


227
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:50,277 line:-2
