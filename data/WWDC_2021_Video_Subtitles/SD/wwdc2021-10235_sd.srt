00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.078 line:-1 align:center
[Will] Hi, my name is Will,


4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,146 line:-2
and I'm a design manager
at Apple.


5
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.648 line:-2 align:center
Today, with my colleague
Hannah,


6
00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.517 line:-2 align:center
I'll show you
how you can use DocC


7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,785 line:-2
to write interactive
developer tutorials.


8
00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:21.788 line:-2 align:center
Tutorials are a great way
to teach developers the details


9
00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:23.991 line:-2 align:center
of how your swift framework
or package works,


10
00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.726 line:-1 align:center
with step-by-step instructions


11
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,495 line:-2
to build real apps
using your API.


12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,631 line:-2
You may be familiar with some
tutorials


13
00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:31.665 line:-1 align:center
we've written at Apple.


14
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,700 line:-2
We created tutorials
to introduce you


15
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:36,270 line:-1
to SwiftUI and Mac Catalyst.


16
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,705 line:-2
In these introductory tutorials,
you learn the basics


17
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,874 line:-2
of those frameworks
and build your skills


18
00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:43.076 line:-2 align:center
by following
step-by-step code examples.


19
00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.479 line:-2 align:center
We've found that framework
adopters love how quickly


20
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:48,415 line:-2
they can get started with new
ideas presented in tutorials.


21
00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.618 line:-2 align:center
To make writing these tutorials
possible,


22
00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:54.755 line:-2 align:center
we built a documentation
compiler called DocC.


23
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,057 line:-1
DocC leverages markdown


24
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.194 line:-2 align:center
to convert plain text
into a rich, interactive system,


25
00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:03.163 line:-2 align:center
and this year,
we've introduced DocC to Xcode,


26
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,432 line:-2
so you can write tutorials
for your Swift package


27
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:06,667 line:-1
or Swift framework, too.


28
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,403 line:-2
DocC isn't only for developer
tutorials.


29
00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:11.538 line:-2 align:center
DocC can also build
documentation


30
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,173 line:-2
for the Swift frameworks
and packages


31
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:15,175 line:-2
in your project
from source comments,


32
00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.677 line:-1 align:center
which means for app developers,


33
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.979 line:-2 align:center
your dependencies
can have documentation


34
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,315 line:-2
right alongside platform
libraries


35
00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:23.250 line:-2 align:center
in the developer documentation
window.


36
00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:26.653 line:-2 align:center
And if you create Swift
frameworks or Swift packages,


37
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,589 line:-2
you can write documentation
for your adopters


38
00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:31.892 line:-2 align:center
right in your source,
so it's easy to keep up-to-date


39
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,161 line:-1
as you create and modify API.


40
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,763 line:-2
You write documentation comments
with markdown


41
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,333 line:-2
to preserve readability
in source, while providing


42
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,102 line:-2
a rich formatting experience
for the documentation window.


43
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,405 line:-2
You can also write articles
and organize all the API


44
00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.107 line:-1 align:center
in your framework or package


45
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,042 line:-2
by adding a Documentation
Catalog.


46
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,379 line:-2
You can learn more about
using DocC


47
00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:53.814 line:-2 align:center
and configuring Documentation
Catalogs


48
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,883 line:0
in the sessions listed here.


49
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,888 line:-2
In this session,
I'll focus on writing tutorials.


50
00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:04.191 line:-2 align:center
Tutorials are a
highly-interactive form


51
00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.425 line:-1 align:center
of documentation,


52
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.728 line:-2 align:center
and in order to make
authoring them easy,


53
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,631 line:-2
we've extended markdown
to have directives.


54
00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:14.034 line:-2 align:center
Directives provide structure to
author content-like tutorials


55
00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.669 line:-2 align:center
so you can focus on
writing content


56
00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.204 line:-1 align:center
with existing markdown syntax


57
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,939 line:-2
you might already be
familiar with.


58
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,877 line:-2
Developer tutorials are centered
around building real projects,


59
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:25.312 line:-1 align:center
ideally apps.


60
00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:28.182 line:-2 align:center
Tutorial apps should use the API
in your framework


61
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,583 line:-1
in a realistic way.


62
00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:33.887 line:-2 align:center
For example,
in the SwiftUI tutorials,


63
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:36.557 line:-2 align:center
we show you how to build
an app called Landmarks


64
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.693 line:-2 align:center
that explores the core features
beginners need to understand


65
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,528 line:-1
to get started with SwiftUI.


66
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:46,166 line:-2
With Mac Catalyst, we teach you
to build a Recipes app


67
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.734 line:-1 align:center
that explores the differences


68
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,504 line:-2
between iPad
and Mac navigation idioms.


69
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,340 line:-1
And now, my colleagues and I


70
00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:54.641 line:-2 align:center
have been working on
a new framework


71
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,777 line:-2
for creating, cataloging,
and caring


72
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.713 line:-2 align:center
for cute little digital sloths
right on your iPhone.


73
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,583 line:-2
My colleagues
have already written


74
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,052 line:-2
some great reference
documentation and articles,


75
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,554 line:-2
but I think adopters
of this framework will benefit


76
00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:10.424 line:-2 align:center
from learning to build a real
app so they can quickly see


77
00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:13.026 line:-2 align:center
how the different aspects
of the framework interact.


78
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,596 line:-2
In this session,
my colleague Hannah and I


79
00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.432 line:-2 align:center
will build tutorials to teach
adopters of this framework


80
00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:20.701 line:-2 align:center
the basics they need
to get started with it.


81
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,669 line:-2
I'll start by giving you
an overview


82
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,738 line:-2
of the main components
of tutorials.


83
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,608 line:-2
Then I'll explain how I
approach ideation and planning.


84
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,877 line:-2
And finally,
I'll hand it off to Hannah,


85
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.679 line:-2 align:center
who will demo creating
a collection of tutorials.


86
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,448 line:-2
All right.
Let's get started.


87
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,984 line:-2
As I mentioned earlier,
tutorials are


88
00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:39.052 line:-2 align:center
a highly-interactive
way to learn.


89
00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:41.655 line:-2 align:center
And like article
and reference documentation,


90
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,424 line:-2
the text of tutorials
is authored in markdown,


91
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,627 line:-2
but tutorials use
a special syntax


92
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,462 line:-2
to wrap this markdown
in a directive


93
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,897 line:-1
that provides structure


94
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.065 line:-2 align:center
so DocC
can build the complex layout


95
00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.034 line:-2 align:center
and interactions
featured in the tutorial.


96
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,205 line:-2
This is a basic directive
that tells DocC


97
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,208 line:-2
this text is a single step
of a tutorial.


98
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,011 line:-2
Along with the instructive text,
this example includes a link


99
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:07,047 line:-2
to a Swift file that DocC
will display to show readers


100
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.716 line:-2 align:center
exactly what code to write
to accomplish the step.


101
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:13.120 line:-2 align:center
And DocC directives
can be nested.


102
00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:16.456 line:-2 align:center
In this case, the code directive
contains an image directive


103
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,760 line:-2
that provides the reader
more context for the step.


104
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.931 line:-2 align:center
Tutorial pages have lots of
individual steps,


105
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,199 line:-1
like the one we just looked at.


106
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,935 line:-2
The table of contents
provides organization


107
00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:30.137 line:-2 align:center
and links to the individual
tutorials.


108
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,805 line:-2
Let's take a look at
the directives


109
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,440 line:-1
of a table of contents.


110
00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.344 line:-1 align:center
The table of contents file


111
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,213 line:-2
starts with
a Tutorials directive,


112
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,348 line:-2
which contains all the elements
of the page.


113
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,485 line:-2
Inside the Tutorials directive,
there is an Intro directive,


114
00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:48.422 line:-2 align:center
which includes a title
and a brief description


115
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,257 line:-2
of what the framework adopter
will build


116
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,725 line:-1
throughout the tutorials.


117
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,596 line:-2
DocC generates some elements
of the introduction,


118
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,064 line:-1
such as the "Get Started" button


119
00:04:57.097 --> 00:04:59.166 line:-2 align:center
and timing calculation
automatically


120
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,801 line:-2
when you provide links
to the tutorials


121
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,703 line:-1
in the Table of Contents page.


122
00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:06.840 line:-2 align:center
The introduction also contains
an image directive.


123
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,242 line:-1
You can store images


124
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:11,445 line:-2
in your documentation catalog
resources folder.


125
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,414 line:-2
Down the page,
you'll find a Chapter directive.


126
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,583 line:-2
You use chapters to organize
tutorials


127
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,252 line:-2
into groups that make sense
together.


128
00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:21.688 line:-2 align:center
Chapters give framework adopters
a clear sense of progress


129
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,491 line:-2
as they follow your tutorials,
as well as provide context


130
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,093 line:-2
for what a framework
is all about.


131
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:28,962 line:-1
Inside the Chapter,


132
00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:31.265 line:-2 align:center
there are individual links
to tutorials.


133
00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:33.400 line:-2 align:center
With all the context set
by this page,


134
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,702 line:-2
framework adopters should
have a good understanding


135
00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:38.105 line:-2 align:center
for what the framework is
and what they'll build with it


136
00:05:38.138 --> 00:05:40.274 line:-2 align:center
before navigating
to a Tutorial page.


137
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,378 line:-2
Much like the table of contents,
the Tutorial page starts


138
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,612 line:-1
with a single directive


139
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,347 line:-2
that contains
the contents of the page.


140
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:51.084 line:-2 align:center
In this case, it's
a single Tutorial directive.


141
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,556 line:-2
DocC uses some information
from the Table of Contents page


142
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,525 line:-2
in the tutorial introduction,
letting folks know


143
00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:00.460 line:-2 align:center
what the overall theme
of this tutorial is


144
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,563 line:-2
by referencing the chapter
it belongs to.


145
00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:07.134 line:-2 align:center
The introduction to the tutorial
includes a title and description


146
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,569 line:-1
that tell the framework adopter


147
00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:09.937 line:-2 align:center
which part the framework
they'll use


148
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,405 line:-1
and what they'll build with it.


149
00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:14.174 line:-2 align:center
To provide clarity
along the path of building,


150
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,510 line:-2
tutorials
are broken up into sections.


151
00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.612 line:-2 align:center
Section introductions
are very similar


152
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,113 line:-1
to tutorial introductions,


153
00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:22.816 line:-2 align:center
but are specific to progress
the framework adopter will make


154
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,785 line:-2
before moving on
to the next section.


155
00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:28.055 line:-1 align:center
Sections contain steps,


156
00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:31.291 line:-2 align:center
which instruct the adopter
on what exactly they need to do


157
00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:33.493 line:-1 align:center
to move on to the next step.


158
00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:35.863 line:-2 align:center
Steps should be short,
easy to understand,


159
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,564 line:-1
and easy to follow.


160
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,235 line:-2
Framework adopters rely on
consistent


161
00:06:41.268 --> 00:06:43.937 line:-2 align:center
and clear tutorial steps
to help them get up-to-speed


162
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:46.039 line:-2 align:center
on the framework
they're learning about quickly.


163
00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:48.709 line:-2 align:center
It's easier to create
a cohesive set of steps


164
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,344 line:-2
throughout a collection
of tutorials


165
00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:52.479 line:-1 align:center
if you start with a clear plan.


166
00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:54.515 line:-2 align:center
Let me show you
how I make this plan


167
00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:56.950 line:-2 align:center
by outlining a collection
of developer tutorials


168
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,453 line:-1
for our new Sloth framework.


169
00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:02.122 line:-2 align:center
In order to understand
how to outline a framework,


170
00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:04.491 line:-2 align:center
it's best to think
about how the framework works


171
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,426 line:-2
and what the real-world uses
are for it.


172
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.162 line:-2 align:center
Now, the framework my colleagues
and I have been working on


173
00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:11.365 line:-2 align:center
is all about sloths,
and it provides quite a bit


174
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:14,034 line:-2
of cool functionality
I'm excited to see people use.


175
00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:16.270 line:-1 align:center
Here's a high-level view


176
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,205 line:-2
of the main functionality
in the framework.


177
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,274 line:-2
In order to outline my
tutorials,


178
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,409 line:-2
I'm going to list the most
important API


179
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,744 line:-1
so I can get a good idea


180
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,646 line:-2
of how to explain them
through tutorials.


181
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,183 line:-2
You can see there's API
like the Sloth type itself,


182
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,885 line:-2
as well as a Food Generator
and PowerPicker.


183
00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.221 line:-2 align:center
If I try to think about these
all at once,


184
00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:35.856 line:-2 align:center
it's going to be tricky
to decide


185
00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.724 line:-2 align:center
how I should teach them
in a clear order.


186
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:40,594 line:-2
So let me group them
by general functional area.


187
00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:44.164 line:-2 align:center
I know understanding the
Sloth type is really important


188
00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:45.732 line:-2 align:center
for the adopters of this
framework,


189
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,768 line:-2
so I'll group everything related
to creating


190
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.403 line:-1 align:center
and editing the Sloth type.


191
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,338 line:-1
APIs used for generating sloths,


192
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:53.407 line:-2 align:center
giving them names,
editing their powers:


193
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.577 line:-2 align:center
these are the core API used
for creating sloths.


194
00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.881 line:-2 align:center
And it turns out, the remaining
API, like food generator,


195
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,851 line:-2
care schedule, and habitat,
are all related, as well.


196
00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:06.653 line:-2 align:center
These API
about taking care of sloths.


197
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.657 line:-2 align:center
So, it looks like I have two
main API groupings


198
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,792 line:-1
that make up the framework:


199
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,394 line:-2
the group of API
that are about creating sloths


200
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:16,897 line:-2
and the group of API that
are about caring for sloths.


201
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,565 line:-1
This is a great start.


202
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,301 line:-2
I know that adopters will need
to understand these API


203
00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:23.270 line:-2 align:center
to successfully use our
framework.


204
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,874 line:-2
And grouping them in this way
will make it easy for me


205
00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:29.209 line:-2 align:center
to show them how they function
together.


206
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,512 line:-2
But I also know that adopters
of this framework are likely


207
00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:34.281 line:-2 align:center
to want to do more complicated
things in their own apps.


208
00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:37.050 line:-1 align:center
So, I'll add another group.


209
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:40,053 line:-2
Our new framework is all about
creating and caring for sloths,


210
00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:42.289 line:-2 align:center
but I want to prepare folks
to use it in ways


211
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,291 line:-2
that go beyond the API
it includes,


212
00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:46.159 line:-2 align:center
so I should include
some information


213
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,228 line:-1
about interoperability.


214
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:51,164 line:-2
I think adopters are likely to
use the framework to help sloths


215
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,168 line:-2
interact with other animals,
move around different locations,


216
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.136 line:-1 align:center
or hang out in groups of sloths.


217
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.405 line:-2 align:center
I'm not trying to imagine
every use case.


218
00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:00.874 line:-2 align:center
I just want enough variety
to introduce folks


219
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,744 line:-2
to ways they might use
the framework in their own apps.


220
00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:06.580 line:-1 align:center
With these three groups,


221
00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:09.149 line:-2 align:center
I have a great start
organizing my tutorials.


222
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:11,852 line:-2
For now, I'll turn these groups
into chapters,


223
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,021 line:-2
and I'll use them
to brainstorm app ideas


224
00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.923 line:-2 align:center
to let me teach the adopters
of my framework


225
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,125 line:-1
how to use my API in a real app.


226
00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:20.861 line:-2 align:center
For the tutorials,
I've designed an app


227
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.430 line:-2 align:center
that has features
for each of these three areas.


228
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,666 line:-2
For creating,
I'll make a simple view


229
00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:27.734 line:-2 align:center
that lets users generate
a new sloth


230
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,770 line:-1
and assign it a color and power.


231
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:32,840 line:-2
For caring, I'll give users
the ability to see


232
00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:36.009 line:-2 align:center
the sloth's general activity
level, appetite, and mood.


233
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,678 line:-1
And for the interaction section,


234
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,613 line:-2
I'll make a feature
that lets users


235
00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:41.915 line:-2 align:center
find their sloths
as they move around the world


236
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,584 line:-1
and interact with other animals.


237
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.320 line:-1 align:center
With my app idea sketched out,


238
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,455 line:-2
I'm ready to plan
how I'll build it


239
00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:50.190 line:-2 align:center
and how I'll teach people
to build it, too.


240
00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:52.693 line:-2 align:center
I'll write a list of tutorials
for each chapter


241
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,596 line:-2
that roughly follows how I'd go
about building the app.


242
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,532 line:-2
First, I'd make the view
for creating sloths.


243
00:09:58.565 --> 00:09:59.833 line:-1 align:center
Then I'd work on


244
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,269 line:-2
the more complicated
caring-for-sloths features.


245
00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:04.771 line:-2 align:center
Finally,
I'd build the parts of the app


246
00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:06.240 line:-1 align:center
that use other frameworks.


247
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,244 line:-2
After all this planning,
I have a list of tutorials


248
00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:12.479 line:-2 align:center
that I'm confident will help
adopters of our framework


249
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,047 line:-1
create and care for sloths.


250
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,683 line:-2
This plan might change
as I write, but for now,


251
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,452 line:-2
it'll help me
organize my thoughts


252
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,587 line:-2
and make sure I've covered
all the important API


253
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,789 line:-2
in a clear
but not redundant way.


254
00:10:23.323 --> 00:10:25.792 line:-2 align:center
So far, we've explored
the directive syntax


255
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,728 line:-2
and the components
that make up tutorials.


256
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,329 line:-2
We've also walked through
the basics


257
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,465 line:-2
of outlining
a collection of tutorials.


258
00:10:31.498 --> 00:10:33.934 line:-2 align:center
At this point,
we're ready to start writing,


259
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,903 line:-2
so I'll hand it off to
my colleague Hannah


260
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:39,806 line:-2
who will show you how to write
tutorials with DocC in Xcode 13.


261
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.976 line:-2 align:center
[Hannah] Thanks, Will.
My name is Hannah.


262
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,113 line:-2
I'm a Human Interface designer
here at Apple.


263
00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:49.716 line:-2 align:center
Now that I have an outline
of the SlothCreator Tutorials,


264
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,520 line:-2
with the all-new DocC feature
in Xcode 13,


265
00:10:53.554 --> 00:10:56.657 line:-2 align:center
let's walk through how
to write a tutorial together.


266
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,962 line:-2
My colleague, Bea and Jack,
covered how to create


267
00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:05.365 line:-2 align:center
a Documentation Catalog
to organize documentation files


268
00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:09.703 line:-2 align:center
in the session "Elevate Your
DocC Documentation in Xcode."


269
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,605 line:-1
I'm going to add my tutorials


270
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,640 line:-2
in the same Documentation
Catalog


271
00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:15.676 line:-1 align:center
they created for SlothCreator.


272
00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:18.879 line:-2 align:center
As Will mentioned,
we need a table of contents file


273
00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:21.415 line:-2 align:center
in order to compile
the tutorials.


274
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:24,852 line:-2
So I've already created
a Tutorials folder


275
00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:26.787 line:-1 align:center
and a Table of Contents file


276
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,822 line:-1
for my SlothCreator Tutorials.


277
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,493 line:-2
Now, let's start creating
my first tutorial!


278
00:11:35.462 --> 00:11:38.799 line:-2 align:center
First, I'll right click
on the Tutorials folder,


279
00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:42.302 line:-2 align:center
select New File to bring up
the template selector,


280
00:11:42.336 --> 00:11:45.639 line:-2 align:center
then select Tutorial file,
click Next.


281
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:51,845 line:-2
I'll name this tutorial
"Creating Custom Sloths."


282
00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:58.085 line:-2 align:center
DocC provides a template
for me to start with.


283
00:11:58.118 --> 00:11:59.920 line:-1 align:center
In the tutorial file template,


284
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,289 line:-1
there's an intro, a section,


285
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,791 line:-2
and a set of steps
in the section.


286
00:12:06.093 --> 00:12:07.461 line:-1 align:center
If I want, I can show


287
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,731 line:-2
the estimated time of completion
for my tutorial.


288
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:14,101 line:-2
I'll say it takes about
20 minutes.


289
00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:19.373 line:-2 align:center
Let's continue with the title
of this tutorial.


290
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,508 line:-1
Here, I'll put in


291
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:23,644 line:-1
"Creating Custom Sloths."


292
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,948 line:-2
Then add my overview of
this tutorial.


293
00:12:29.483 --> 00:12:32.686 line:-2 align:center
I want to make my tutorial
look more engaging,


294
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,621 line:-1
so I prepared some art files


295
00:12:34.655 --> 00:12:38.492 line:-2 align:center
for the tutorial intro,
section intro, and steps.


296
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,295 line:-1
Let me open my Art File folder,


297
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,865 line:-2
select all the images
I prepared,


298
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,901 line:-2
drag and drop them
into the Resources folder


299
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,536 line:-1
in the Documentation Catalog.


300
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:53,540 line:-2
Let me show you
the intro image I designed.


301
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:56,543 line:-2
It visually describes
what our framework adopters


302
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:59,279 line:-2
are going to build in this
tutorial.


303
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:02,649 line:-1
To add the intro image,


304
00:13:02.683 --> 00:13:05.652 line:-2 align:center
I'll put in the image file name
after "source."


305
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,556 line:-1
I'm also going to add


306
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.359 line:-2 align:center
an accessible description
for the image.


307
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:17,497 line:-2
I want my tutorials
to be accessible to everyone


308
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,033 line:-2
so that every SlothCreator
adopter


309
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,469 line:-2
can have a great learning
experience


310
00:13:22.503 --> 00:13:26.006 line:-2 align:center
through both reading
and listening to the tutorials.


311
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,408 line:-1
An accessible description


312
00:13:28.442 --> 00:13:30.644 line:-2 align:center
describes
what's self-explanatory


313
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,280 line:-2
to someone
who's looking at the image.


314
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,516 line:-1
For example,


315
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,918 line:-1
I'll describe the intro image as


316
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,654 line:-1
"A wireframe of an app interface


317
00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:43.624 line:-1 align:center
that has an outline of a sloth


318
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,894 line:-2
and four buttons
below the sloth.


319
00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:50.097 line:-2 align:center
The buttons display
the following symbols,


320
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.032 line:-1 align:center
from left to right:


321
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,901 line:-1
ice, fire,


322
00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:56.136 line:-1 align:center
wind, and lightning."


323
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.472 line:-2 align:center
Let's add the description
in the code.


324
00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:05.812 line:-2 align:center
Now that I've completed
the intro of this tutorial,


325
00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:08.849 line:-2 align:center
let's move on to
the first section.


326
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,020 line:-2
This is going to be
a beginner-friendly tutorial.


327
00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:14.488 line:-1 align:center
So in the first section,


328
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,657 line:-2
our framework adopters
will start with


329
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,826 line:-2
setting up the basics
for the Slothy app.


330
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:23,597 line:-1
I'll put in the section title


331
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,633 line:-2
and add a description
of the section.


332
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,973 line:-2
I'm also going to add
the section image I prepared,


333
00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:34.908 line:-1 align:center
which visually represents


334
00:14:34.942 --> 00:14:37.311 line:-1 align:center
the task flow of this section.


335
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,547 line:-2
Similar to how I added
the intro image,


336
00:14:40.581 --> 00:14:43.750 line:-1 align:center
I'll put in the image file name


337
00:14:43.784 --> 00:14:46.320 line:-1 align:center
and an accessible description.


338
00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:50.757 line:-1 align:center
Next, let's move on to steps.


339
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.629 line:-2 align:center
In the first step
in this section,


340
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,865 line:-2
our framework adopters
will create


341
00:14:57.898 --> 00:15:01.602 line:-2 align:center
a new Xcode project
using the iOS app template.


342
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:04,204 line:-2
I'll put that
in the instruction.


343
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,076 line:-1
The media of this step


344
00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:11.478 line:-2 align:center
should give adopters
more context


345
00:15:11.512 --> 00:15:14.982 line:-2 align:center
on how to do it,
so I took a screenshot


346
00:15:15.015 --> 00:15:17.851 line:-1 align:center
of Xcode's template selector


347
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:21,421 line:-2
and highlighted the areas
they need to interact with.


348
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:24,725 line:-1
One thing to keep in mind,


349
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,694 line:-2
when our framework adopters
are viewing this tutorial,


350
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:30,230 line:-2
the background for Sections
and Steps


351
00:15:30.264 --> 00:15:32.432 line:-1 align:center
could be either light or dark


352
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:35,002 line:-1
based on their Xcode settings.


353
00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:38.872 line:-2 align:center
So I can either create an image
that is dark-mode compatible


354
00:15:38.906 --> 00:15:41.175 line:-1 align:center
or provide a separate image


355
00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:43.143 line:-1 align:center
for each appearance.


356
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,047 line:-1
I'll add this image to the step.


357
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:51,285 line:-1
Now I have added the first step,


358
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:54,922 line:-2
I'll go ahead and add the rest
of the steps in section 1.


359
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:02,896 line:-1
Okay.


360
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,732 line:-2
I've completed the steps
in the first section.


361
00:16:05.766 --> 00:16:09.436 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a look how this
tutorial is coming along.


362
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,372 line:-2
In Xcode 13,
I can preview my tutorials


363
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:15,275 line:-2
in the Developer Documentation
window by navigating


364
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:19.079 line:-1 align:center
to Product Build documentation,


365
00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:21.315 line:-1 align:center
or use the shortcut by pressing


366
00:16:21.348 --> 00:16:24.184 line:-2 align:center
control+shift+command+D
on the keyboard.


367
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,958 line:-2
Great! The tutorials
compiled successfully.


368
00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:33.493 line:-2 align:center
And now,
I can preview what I wrote


369
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,563 line:-2
in the Documentation Window
that just popped up.


370
00:16:36.597 --> 00:16:39.766 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a look
at the Table of Contents page.


371
00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:42.402 line:-1 align:center
On the navigator on the left,


372
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,571 line:-2
I can see my tutorials
are organized


373
00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:46.740 line:-1 align:center
under the SlothCreator project,


374
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,809 line:-1
along with other documentation


375
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,445 line:-2
my colleagues wrote
for SlothCreator.


376
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:55,215 line:-2
On the right side, I can see
the Table of Contents page.


377
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:58,118 line:-2
There is an overview
for the tutorial collection


378
00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:01.922 line:-2 align:center
and an eye-catching image
in the intro section.


379
00:17:03.123 --> 00:17:06.360 line:-2 align:center
Below the intro,
there's my first chapter


380
00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:08.962 line:-2 align:center
and a link to the tutorial
I just wrote.


381
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,831 line:-1
Let's take a look.


382
00:17:13.901 --> 00:17:16.036 line:-2 align:center
From the top of
the Tutorial page,


383
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.938 line:-1 align:center
there's the tutorial intro,


384
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,840 line:-2
which tells our framework
adopters


385
00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:23.076 line:-2 align:center
that they will build
a SlothCreation view,


386
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,812 line:-2
and it'll take them about
20 minutes.


387
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,550 line:-1
Below that is the first section.


388
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:33,086 line:-2
In this section,
adopters will go through


389
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.456 line:-2 align:center
four simple steps
to set up their project.


390
00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:39.660 line:-1 align:center
We can see the image updates


391
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:42,529 line:-1
as we scroll down the steps.


392
00:17:42.563 --> 00:17:45.299 line:-1 align:center
So far, everything looks good.


393
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,768 line:-2
In the second section,
our framework adopters


394
00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:51.371 line:-2 align:center
will start coding
with SlothCreator.


395
00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:54.975 line:-2 align:center
Let's move on to see how
to guide them with code steps.


396
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:59,313 line:-1
I've already completed the intro


397
00:17:59.346 --> 00:18:01.982 line:-1 align:center
of section 2 and the first step.


398
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,618 line:-2
Let's take a look at
the second step,


399
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:07.554 line:-2 align:center
where our framework adopters
are importing


400
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:10,190 line:-2
the SlothCreator package
in the Swift file


401
00:18:10.224 --> 00:18:12.860 line:-2 align:center
they created
in the previous step.


402
00:18:12.893 --> 00:18:14.461 line:-1 align:center
Before we dive into it,


403
00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:17.097 line:-2 align:center
I want to point out
a couple of things.


404
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.400 line:-2 align:center
A code step shows
the display name on top,


405
00:18:20.434 --> 00:18:23.837 line:-2 align:center
telling adopters which file
they should be working on.


406
00:18:25.172 --> 00:18:27.741 line:-1 align:center
DocC will display the Swift file


407
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,276 line:-1
I'm adding for this step


408
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,846 line:-2
on the right side of the screen,
below the display name.


409
00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:38.185 line:-2 align:center
DocC can also automatically
compare


410
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:41,488 line:-2
the current code file
with the one from previous step


411
00:18:41.522 --> 00:18:44.791 line:-2 align:center
and highlight the new portion
of the code.


412
00:18:46.593 --> 00:18:49.796 line:-2 align:center
This code file generates
a preview.


413
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.799 line:-2 align:center
I can add a screenshot
of the preview to this step


414
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,735 line:-1
so that adopters can check


415
00:18:54.768 --> 00:18:58.071 line:-2 align:center
if they have followed
the instruction successfully.


416
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:02,876 line:-2
Let's go back to Xcode
and finish this step.


417
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,647 line:-1
First, add the display name,


418
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.650 line:-1 align:center
then the code file name,


419
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:12,819 line:-1
and lastly, the preview image.


420
00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:18.992 line:-2 align:center
Now we've gone over how
to add a code step,


421
00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:21.628 line:-2 align:center
I'll go ahead and add
the rest of the steps


422
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,197 line:-1
in section 2.


423
00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:37.778 line:-2 align:center
So far, we've walked through
how to write a tutorial intro,


424
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:41,081 line:-2
a section,
and different types of steps.


425
00:19:41.114 --> 00:19:43.584 line:-2 align:center
Now, I'm going to
add all the tutorials


426
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,953 line:-1
I've written for SlothCreator.


427
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:49,189 line:-1
Let me open Finder,


428
00:19:49.223 --> 00:19:53.160 line:-2 align:center
select all the tutorial files
I prepared,


429
00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:54.761 line:-1 align:center
drag and drop them


430
00:19:54.795 --> 00:19:57.030 line:-1 align:center
into the Tutorials folder.


431
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:01,335 line:-2
Next, I'll open
the Table of Contents file,


432
00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:03.403 line:-1 align:center
link the other two tutorials


433
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:06,206 line:-1
in the first chapter,


434
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,077 line:-2
then add the second
and the third chapter.


435
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,320 line:-2
Okay, now I have completed
SlothCreator Tutorials.


436
00:20:20.354 --> 00:20:22.256 line:-1 align:center
Let's take a look together.


437
00:20:22.289 --> 00:20:24.124 line:-1 align:center
From the Table of Contents page,


438
00:20:24.157 --> 00:20:27.361 line:-2 align:center
we can see this tutorial
collection includes


439
00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:29.196 line:-1 align:center
eight tutorials organized


440
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,098 line:-1
into three chapters.


441
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,834 line:-1
I can also see this structure


442
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:35,969 line:-1
from the navigator on the left.


443
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,807 line:-2
This page is a great way to
provide our framework adopters


444
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:44,278 line:-2
a summarized view
of this tutorial collection.


445
00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:47.581 line:-2 align:center
Let's also take a look at
the Tutorial page I just wrote.


446
00:20:47.614 --> 00:20:51.718 line:-2 align:center
We have seen the intro
and the first section,


447
00:20:51.752 --> 00:20:53.487 line:-2 align:center
which guides our framework
adopters


448
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.356 line:-2 align:center
through
how to set up their project.


449
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,894 line:-1
Below that is the second section


450
00:21:00.928 --> 00:21:04.064 line:-2 align:center
that provides adopters
clear coding instructions


451
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,801 line:-2
on how to build
a sloth customization view.


452
00:21:09.403 --> 00:21:10.537 line:-1 align:center
Awesome!


453
00:21:10.571 --> 00:21:12.873 line:-1 align:center
The tutorials look really good!


454
00:21:12.906 --> 00:21:16.076 line:-2 align:center
I'm sure our framework adopters
will be excited


455
00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:19.646 line:-2 align:center
to learn about SlothCreator
when they see my tutorials.


456
00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:24.284 line:-2 align:center
In this session,
we went over what tutorials are,


457
00:21:24.318 --> 00:21:26.286 line:-1 align:center
what makes a good tutorial,


458
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,623 line:-2
how to outline tutorials,
and how to use DocC


459
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,025 line:-1
to write and preview tutorials.


460
00:21:33.193 --> 00:21:35.329 line:-1 align:center
DocC is a powerful new


461
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,931 line:-2
documentation feature
in Xcode 13.


462
00:21:37.965 --> 00:21:39.499 line:-1 align:center
With it, you can write


463
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:42,202 line:-2
comprehensive documentation
for your framework,


464
00:21:42.236 --> 00:21:46.106 line:-2 align:center
including reference, articles,
and tutorials.


465
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:50,811 align:center
To learn more about how to
write, build,


466
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:53,614 line:0
and organize your documentation
with DocC,


467
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:56,350 align:center
I recommend you check out
other DocC sessions


468
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,452 align:center
from WWDC this year.


469
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,755 line:-1
Thank you for learning with us,


470
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,257 line:-1
and we are thrilled to see


471
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,561 line:-2
what you are going to create
with DocC in Xcode 13.


472
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,596 line:-1
[upbeat music]
