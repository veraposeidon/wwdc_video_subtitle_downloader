Prabha Bashyam:
Hello, my name is Prabha,


7
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,915 line:-1
and I'm on the Apple Media
Products Engineering team.


8
00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.116 line:-1 position:50%
In this session,


9
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,785 line:-1
I'm going to tell you about
some exciting new features


10
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:23,657 line:-1
to optimize your App Store
product page on iPhone and iPad.


11
00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:26.727 line:-1 position:50%
Today the product page
is the home for your app.


12
00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:29.162 line:-1 position:50%
It's where users learn
all about your app,


13
00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.365 line:-1 position:50%
before they decide
to download it.


14
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,501 line:-1
You use the app icon,
name, and subtitle


15
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,837 line:-1
to make a great
first impression.


16
00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:39.973 line:-1 position:50%
And you share even more
details with app preview videos,


17
00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:43.911 line:-1 position:50%
screenshots, promotional text,
and the description.


18
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:47,581 line:-1
Later this year, you'll be able
to use custom product pages


19
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,784 line:-1
and product page optimization
to make your product page


20
00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:54.354 line:-1 position:50%
even more relevant and effective
for your audience.


21
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,223 line:-1
For each of these
new capabilities,


22
00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:59.159 line:-1 position:50%
I'll provide details
on how the feature works


23
00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.763 line:-1 position:50%
and share more about what you
can do to get ready for them.


24
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,531 line:-1
With custom product pages,


25
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:08.535 line:-1 position:50%
the product page
becomes even more flexible.


26
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,571 line:-1
Custom product pages let you
showcase different features


27
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,975 line:-1
and content for different users.


28
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:18,111 line:0
Each one can have a different
set of app preview videos,


29
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,380 position:50%
screenshots,
and promotional text.


30
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,816 line:0
Each page is fully localizable,


31
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:27,788 position:50%
and each is shareable
using its own unique URL.


32
00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:31.024 line:-1 position:50%
You'll also be able to view
metrics for each page,


33
00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:34.328 line:-1 position:50%
including impressions,
downloads, and conversion rate


34
00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:35.829 line:-1 position:50%
in App Analytics.


35
00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.099 line:-1 position:50%
This information lets you know
how effective each page is


36
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,136 line:-1
at driving users
to download your app.


37
00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:46.707 line:-1 position:50%
You will also be able to monitor
what happens after the download.


38
00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:49.443 line:-1 position:50%
App Analytics will provide
retention data


39
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,611 line:-1
and average proceeds
per paying user


40
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.480 line:-1 position:50%
for each custom product page,


41
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.517 line:-1 position:50%
so you can see how certain pages
are converting users.


42
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:01,088 line:-1
You can create up to 35
different custom product pages


43
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,489 line:-1
for your app.


44
00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.391 line:-1 position:50%
So to prepare for this feature,


45
00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:07.194 line:-1 position:50%
think carefully about
how you want to use them.


46
00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:09.930 line:-1 position:50%
Consider the rich content
and engaging features


47
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.701 line:-1 position:50%
your app has to offer
and how you can highlight them.


48
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,470 line:-1
For an app
like Mountain Climber,


49
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.673 line:-1 position:50%
we could choose to showcase
the live streaming functionality


50
00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:20.974 line:-1 position:50%
to appeal to people


51
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.443 line:-1 position:50%
interested in following climbers
in real time


52
00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:27.247 line:-1 position:50%
or streaming their own journeys
up to the summit.


53
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,017 line:-1
And we could create
another custom product page


54
00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:32.419 line:-1 position:50%
highlighting
the GPS tracking feature


55
00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.921 line:-1 position:50%
to appeal to people
interested in planning a climb


56
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.591 line:-1 position:50%
with a group of friends.


57
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,394 line:-1
If you develop a game,
you may want to create one


58
00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:42.963 line:-1 position:50%
to highlight your most
engaging characters


59
00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:44.931 line:-1 position:50%
or popular gameplay modes.


60
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:47.300 line:-1 position:50%
If your app features
video content,


61
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.137 line:-1 position:50%
you can consider creating
custom product pages


62
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:53,440 line:-1
for specific shows or channels.


63
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.343 line:-1 position:50%
No matter how you want to use
custom product pages,


64
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,912 line:-1
here's how you can get ready
for this feature.


65
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,580 line:-1
First, plan your goals.


66
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.051 line:-1 position:50%
Have a clear objective in mind
before you set up your page.


67
00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:07.721 line:-1 position:50%
Remember you can create
up to 35 custom product pages,


68
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,725 line:-1
so carefully plan
how you want to use them.


69
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,828 line:-1
Next, consider the features
and content in your app


70
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:19,199 line:-1
and the ones you want
to highlight on these pages.


71
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.802 line:-1 position:50%
Lastly, begin preparing
your metadata.


72
00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:23.403 line:-1 position:50%
Remember each page
can have


73
00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:26.273 line:-1 position:50%
a different set of app preview
videos, screenshots,


74
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,641 line:-1
and promotional text,


75
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:31.011 line:-1 position:50%
so you can get started now
on creating new visual assets


76
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,081 line:-1
and text for your pages.


77
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,450 line:-1
Then, when the feature launches
later this year,


78
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.218 line:-1 position:50%
you'll be ready
to create your pages


79
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,921 line:-1
and submit the metadata
in App Store Connect.


80
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,355 line:-1
And you'll be able to do this


81
00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:45.859 line:-1 position:50%
without having to submit
a new version of your app.


82
00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.196 line:-1 position:50%
Once approved, you'll be able to
share your custom product pages,


83
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,865 line:-1
using their own unique URL.


84
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:55,068 line:-1
Of course, the users who arrive
on your default product page


85
00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.304 line:-1 position:50%
through searching
or browsing the App Store


86
00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:59.473 line:-1 position:50%
are also incredibly important.


87
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:03,577 line:-1
That's why we're introducing
product page optimization.


88
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,913 line:-1
With this feature, you can set
up and test different treatments


89
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,315 line:-1
of your default page


90
00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:12.919 line:-1 position:50%
to determine which one best
resonates with your users.


91
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,323 line:0
For example, given the original
page with the blue icon


92
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,625 line:0
and the treatment page
with the red icon,


93
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,361 position:50%
by splitting the traffic
going to each page


94
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,997 line:0
and measuring download
conversion on each,


95
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,534 position:50%
you may learn that the treatment
page actually performs better,


96
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,570 line:0
suggesting you may want to apply
the treatment metadata


97
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,509 line:0
to your default product page
to improve overall conversion.


98
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,843 position:50%
For your treatment page,


99
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,313 line:0
you have the flexibility
to try a different app icon,


100
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:44,484 position:50%
or you can try different app
preview videos or screenshots.


101
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,287 position:50%
And each test can have
up to three treatments,


102
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:52,459 position:50%
like in this example
with three icon color styles.


103
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,628 position:50%
You can choose the percentage
of your audience


104
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,630 position:50%
that will see
one of the treatments.


105
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,065 position:50%
For example, if you choose 30%,


106
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,068 line:0
then each of the three
treatments would get 10%


107
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,104 line:0
of the total traffic.


108
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,907 line:-1
When running a test
that involves the app icon,


109
00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:10.110 line:-1 position:50%
we've made sure that all users
who download your app


110
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,078 line:-1
will have
a consistent experience.


111
00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:14.781 line:-1 position:50%
After all, your app icon
is an important way


112
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,650 line:-1
to appeal to App Store users


113
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,752 line:-1
and stand out
on their home screens.


114
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,121 line:-1
So for anyone
that sees your test icon


115
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,990 line:-1
on the product page,
they'll see that same icon


116
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,394 line:-1
when they download
your app on their device.


117
00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:30.764 line:-1 position:50%
To allow for this, you'll
include the variant icon assets


118
00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:33.333 line:-1 position:50%
in your app binary
for the version of your app


119
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,634 line:-1
that you want to test,


120
00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:37.537 line:-1 position:50%
including all sizes
for the applicable devices


121
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:42,676 line:-1
and the 1024x1024 version
for the App Store.


122
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,045 line:-1
You'll also have
the ability to run tests


123
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,447 line:-1
in only specific localizations.


124
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,282 line:-1
For example,
if your product page


125
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:53,853 line:-1
is currently localized in
English, Japanese, and Korean,


126
00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:56.723 line:-1 position:50%
you can choose to run your tests
in Japanese only.


127
00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.892 line:-1 position:50%
This means that
any users that see


128
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:02,395 line:-1
the English or Korean localized
versions of your product page


129
00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:04.631 line:-1 position:50%
will not be included
in the test.


130
00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:07.167 line:-1 position:50%
This gives you the flexibility
to focus your test


131
00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.902 line:-1 position:50%
if your treatment
is only relevant


132
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:12,138 line:-1
for a subset
of your localizations.


133
00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:15.208 line:-1 position:50%
As the test runs, you'll be able
to monitor the results,


134
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,210 line:-1
including metrics
for impressions,


135
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.679 line:-1 position:50%
downloads, conversion,
and the improvement


136
00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:23.717 line:-1 position:50%
that each treatment gets
against the baseline.


137
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,620 line:0
For more details on what's
coming in App Analytics,


138
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,889 position:50%
check out
"What's New in App Analytics".


139
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,691 line:-1
After reviewing the results,


140
00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.994 line:-1 position:50%
you'll be able to apply
one of the treatments


141
00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:37.063 line:-1 position:50%
to your app's default page
to let all users see


142
00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.766 line:-1 position:50%
the most effective version
of your page.


143
00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:42.068 line:-1 position:50%
Note that if the treatment
you want to apply


144
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,538 line:-1
features a different app icon,
you'll apply that icon


145
00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:48.174 line:-1 position:50%
by updating the default icon
in the binary


146
00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:51.278 line:-1 position:50%
of the next version of your app.


147
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,680 line:-1
With that overview,


148
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.716 line:-1 position:50%
let's recap what you need to get ready to


149
00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:58.084 line:-1 position:50%
enhance your App Store product page.


150
00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.353 line:-1 position:50%
Before running a test, make


151
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,723 line:-1
sure to form a strong hypothesis. For example, you may predict


152
00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:05.959 line:-1 position:50%
that changing your app icon to a different


153
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,927 line:-1
style will drive better conversion


154
00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.030 line:-1 position:50%
in certain locales. Make sure to have


155
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.300 line:-1 position:50%
all the necessary videos and screenshots ready to go


156
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.101 line:-1 position:50%
when setting up your test.


157
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,604 line:-1
They will be reviewed by App Review before your test can

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:23.977 line:-1 position:50%
And remember, to test
a variation

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:25.979 line:-1 position:50%
of your app icon, you'll need to


161
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,082 line:-1
include the icon assets in the binary of your


162
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,752 line:-1

your

app releases accordingly.


164
00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:37.257 line:-1 position:50%
So these are the new ways you can optimize
your

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:39.693 line:-1 position:50%
App Store product page.


166
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:43,496 line:-1
Custom product pages gives you the flexibility to highlight specific content and


167
00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:47.167 line:-1 position:50%
features in your app. Product page optimization helps

you determine the visual assets that your users
find most appealing.


169
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,507 line:-1
Lastly, all the functionality

we just discussed for both features will be supported

published


172

173
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:08,822 line:-1
to launching these features later this year and seeing how you use them
to optimize


174

your product pages.  Thank you for watching
