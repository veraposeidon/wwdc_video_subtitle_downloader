00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,077 line:-1
[Cindy] Hello.


4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,512 line:-1
I'm Cindy Clarissa.


5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:14,147 line:-2
I'm a software engineer
with Core Location.


6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,549 line:-1
Today, I'll be talking about


7
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,552 line:-2
some cool new things
for Core Location this year.


8
00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.687 line:-2 align:center
We are introducing
two new features


9
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.223 line:-2 align:center
that may let you power
location-based functionality


10
00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:25.659 line:-2 align:center
in your apps
without confronting people


11
00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.362 line:-2 align:center
with the need to grant them
as much authorization.


12
00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:31.632 line:-1 align:center
Starting with the first feature,


13
00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:35.302 line:-2 align:center
we are bringing Region-based
user notifications to watchOS 8.


14
00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:37.571 line:-1 align:center
Now your Apple Watch app


15
00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.273 line:-2 align:center
can remind people
to start a workout


16
00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:41.041 line:-1 align:center
when they arrive at the gym


17
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,377 line:-2
or feed the dog
when they get home.


18
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,378 line:-1
For example,


19
00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:47.514 line:-2 align:center
here we have App in the Air
using this new feature


20
00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.149 line:-2 align:center
to notify people
about their flights


21
00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:51.385 line:-1 align:center
when they arrive at the airport.


22
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,720 line:-2
With Region-based
user notifications,


23
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,890 line:-2
the system can present
spatially relevant information


24
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,425 line:-1
on behalf of your app


25
00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:01.328 line:-2 align:center
without it having
"always" authorization.


26
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,196 line:-1
To learn more


27
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,865 line:-2
about how you can adopt
Region-based user notifications


28
00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.099 line:-1 align:center
for watchOS,


29
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,203 line:-2
check out the session
"What's New in watchOS."


30
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,706 line:-2
Now let's talk about
the main topic of this session.


31
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.742 line:-2 align:center
We're introducing
a new way to request location


32
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,111 line:-2
that gives people more
control over their data


33
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:22,216 line:-2
but, at the same time, gives more
functionalities to your app.


34
00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:23.383 line:-1 align:center
I'll begin by talking


35
00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.953 line:-2 align:center
about today's state
of location authorization


36
00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:28.288 line:-2 align:center
and the motivation
behind our new feature.


37
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,090 line:-1
In iOS 14,


38
00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.926 line:-2 align:center
when an app requests
for location authorization,


39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,728 line:-1
an initial prompt shows up


40
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:38.899 line:-2 align:center
and people have the ability
to choose from Allow Once,


41
00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.803 line:-2 align:center
While in Use,
or Don't Allow authorization.


42
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,605 line:-2
And with last year's
new feature,


43
00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:46.974 line:-2 align:center
people have the ability
to control their precision


44
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.376 line:-2 align:center
of the location
being sent to your app.


45
00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:51.445 line:-1 align:center
Some of you may have noticed


46
00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:54.081 line:-2 align:center
that people select Allow Once
on your app,


47
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,015 line:-1
and it could be


48
00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.417 line:-2 align:center
that they don't think giving
when-in-use authorization


49
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,453 line:-1
is necessary to your app.


50
00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:00.420 line:-1 align:center
For example,


51
00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.223 line:-2 align:center
a pet store app might request
location authorization


52
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:06,059 line:-2
to determine
the closest pet store near them,


53
00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:08.061 line:-2 align:center
but it doesn't require
their location


54
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,931 line:-2
when they are just browsing
for different cat food options.


55
00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:11.899 line:-1 align:center
In this case,


56
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,969 line:-2
people using this app might be
more likely to select Allow Once


57
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:19,039 line:-1
or Don't Allow authorization.


58
00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.108 line:-1 align:center
If people select Allow Once,


59
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,210 line:-2
we would grant
location authorization


60
00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:26.079 line:-2 align:center
for the duration
that they are using your app.


61
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,549 line:-2
But your app
will lose authorization


62
00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:30.384 line:-1 align:center
when it enters the background.


63
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:34,054 line:-2
This could lead to multiple
location authorization requests,


64
00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:37.124 line:-2 align:center
which may negatively
impact the user experience.


65
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.625 line:-1 align:center
In another case,


66
00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.428 line:-2 align:center
you might notice that someone
who is tired of the prompts


67
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.096 line:-1 align:center
might select Don't Allow


68
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,599 line:-2
to prevent the prompts
from being shown again.


69
00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:48.268 line:-2 align:center
This could result
in having to send people


70
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,471 line:-2
to Settings to authorize
for locations later.


71
00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:55.409 line:-2 align:center
As privacy continues to be
an important priority for Apple,


72
00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:56.510 line:-1 align:center
we thought,


73
00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.245 line:-1 align:center
"How can we give more controls


74
00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.681 line:-2 align:center
without
hindering user-experience?”


75
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,116 line:-2
Can we provide
an easy and friendly way


76
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.585 line:-1 align:center
to authorize location


77
00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:06.854 line:-2 align:center
only at the moment
when its needed?


78
00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.156 line:-1 align:center
Starting in iOS 15,


79
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,292 line:-2
we're introducing
CLLocationButton for UIKit


80
00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:14.461 line:-1 align:center
and LocationButton for SwiftUI


81
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,897 line:-2
to tackle the pain points
I've mentioned.


82
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,932 line:-1
Here, we have a Park Finder app


83
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,435 line:-2
that finds
the closest park nearby.


84
00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:22.302 line:-1 align:center
At the bottom,


85
00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:23.871 line:-2 align:center
we have a blue
Location Button


86
00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:25.973 line:-2 align:center
with the title
"Current Location"


87
00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:27.808 line:-1 align:center
next to the arrow glyph.


88
00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:29.309 line:-1 align:center
When I press on the button,


89
00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:32.012 line:-2 align:center
Park Finder is able
to get my current location


90
00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.616 line:-2 align:center
and show a map view
of all the parks nearby.


91
00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.818 line:-2 align:center
A location arrow at
the top left


92
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,654 line:-2
will turn blue
to call to the user's attention


93
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,190 line:-2
to the authorization
they just have granted.


94
00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:44.758 line:-1 align:center
One thing to note


95
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:47.361 line:-2 align:center
is that Location Button
is actually giving your app


96
00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.429 line:-1 align:center
Allow-Once authorization


97
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,866 line:-2
without making people go
through the prompt each time.


98
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,602 line:-2
Later, I will go over
about how this would affect


99
00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:58.038 line:-2 align:center
your existing
authorization status.


100
00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:01.875 line:-2 align:center
We'll be bringing
Location Button to watchOS, iOS,


101
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,279 line:-2
macOS with Catalyst,
and iPad apps on Mac.


102
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,980 line:-1
Now, let's dive into the API


103
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,816 line:-2
and how you can add
CLLocationButton to your app.


104
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,921 line:-2
CLLocationButton is part of
the CoreLocationUI framework.


105
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,556 line:-1
Similar to the UIButton,


106
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:18.592 line:-2 align:center
CLLocationButton
is derived from UIControls.


107
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,563 line:-2
So, you're able to use UIControl
functionalities with the button.


108
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.698 line:-2 align:center
In addition,
we have four properties


109
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,834 line:-1
that are specific to our button.


110
00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:31.905 line:-2 align:center
We have CLLocationButtonIcon
to set the type of the arrow,


111
00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:36.310 line:-2 align:center
CLLocationLabel to set
the label of the button,


112
00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:40.247 line:-2 align:center
a cornerRadius to set
the roundness of the button,


113
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.351 line:-2 align:center
and lastly, we have fontSize
to set the size of the label.


114
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:48,555 line:-2
Now that I went through a brief
overview, you might wonder,


115
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,725 line:-2
"How can I receive location
with CLLocationButton?"


116
00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:55.996 line:-2 align:center
Well, it's similar to requesting
location with a UIButton.


117
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.466 line:-2 align:center
I think it's easier
to understand with an example.


118
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,468 line:-2
Let me demonstrate
how you can replace


119
00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:04.238 line:-2 align:center
your UIButton
with CLLocationButton.


120
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:06.373 line:-1 align:center
In this UIButton example,


121
00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.643 line:-2 align:center
I will create a simple button
that requests for location


122
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:14,181 line:-2
by first requesting when-in-use
authorization upon button tap.


123
00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:16.750 line:-2 align:center
I'll begin by instantiating
a UIButton


124
00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:19.453 line:-2 align:center
and setting it's title
to "Current Location”.


125
00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:22.456 line:-2 align:center
I wanna add a target-action
that calls a function


126
00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.558 line:-2 align:center
and do the necessary action
we want


127
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,860 line:-1
every time a button is tapped.


128
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,497 line:-2
In this case, I wanna display
all the parks nearby.


129
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,600 line:-2
So let's call this function
"showNearByParks”.


130
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,337 line:-2
In this showNearByParks
function,


131
00:05:37.371 --> 00:05:39.339 line:-1 align:center
I will use locationManager


132
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,909 line:-2
to call
requestWhenInUseAuthorization


133
00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:44.111 line:-1 align:center
and startUpdatingLocation.


134
00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:45.479 line:-1 align:center
Within this function,


135
00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.314 line:-1 align:center
I will also add additional logic


136
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.416 line:-2 align:center
to render
the map view accordingly.


137
00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.119 line:-2 align:center
But, for simplicity,
let's omit that.


138
00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:54.755 line:-2 align:center
Let's begin
by replacing UIButton


139
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:57,124 line:-1
by removing the first two lines


140
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,393 line:-2
and replacing it
with an instantiation


141
00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:00.861 line:-1 align:center
of CLLocationButton


142
00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:03.830 line:-2 align:center
and then setting the label
to ".currentLocation”.


143
00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.133 line:-2 align:center
Lastly,
we can comment out the call


144
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,836 line:-2
to
requestWhenInUseAuthorization,


145
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,871 line:-2
and that's because
the Location Button


146
00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:13.173 line:-2 align:center
will grant
a one-time authorization


147
00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:16.777 line:-2 align:center
on your behalf every time
a button is successfully tapped.


148
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,447 line:-2
So if you have
an existing UIButton,


149
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.517 line:-2 align:center
replacing it will be
as simple as shown here.


150
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.552 line:-2 align:center
But we wanna make it
even easier,


151
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,121 line:-2
so you can see an example
of the Park Finder app


152
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,489 line:-1
attached to this talk.


153
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,725 line:-1
For those with SwiftUI apps,


154
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,595 line:-2
the Location Button
is also in SwiftUI.


155
00:06:34.628 --> 00:06:37.965 line:-2 align:center
You can use LocationButton
as shown in the example here.


156
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,199 line:-1
I'd like to point out


157
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:42.202 line:-2 align:center
that I am using SwiftUI's
new "symbolVariant"


158
00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:43.537 line:-1 align:center
to set the arrow type,


159
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.505 line:-1 align:center
and "tint"


160
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,573 line:-2
to set the background color
of the button.


161
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,078 line:-1
Let's go through some examples


162
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,614 line:-2
on how you can customize
Location Button.


163
00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:55.015 line:-1 align:center
With our Location Button,


164
00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:57.317 line:-2 align:center
you are able to customize
the background color,


165
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,785 line:-1
the text and glyph color,


166
00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.288 line:-2 align:center
the rounded corners,
and so forth.


167
00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:03.056 line:-2 align:center
Here are
just some example styles


168
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,992 line:-2
that you can
create with our button.


169
00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:07.127 line:-2 align:center
Let's go through
step-by-step examples


170
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,396 line:-1
of customizing Location Button.


171
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.398 line:-2 align:center
Let's start
with our default button.


172
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,300 line:-2
The default look has
"Current Location" title


173
00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:14.601 line:-1 align:center
in white


174
00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:17.504 line:-2 align:center
and a systemBlue
background color, as shown here.


175
00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:22.376 line:-2 align:center
We can set the button icon
to arrowFilled.


176
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.513 line:-2 align:center
Next, we can change
the foreground color of the icon


177
00:07:26.547 --> 00:07:30.250 line:-2 align:center
by setting tintColor
from white to black...


178
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:34,121 line:-2
and then setting
the backgroundColor to white.


179
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,256 line:-2
And lastly,
I can set the corner radius


180
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.860 line:-2 align:center
to have rounded corners
by setting it to 25.0.


181
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,630 line:-2
And depending on how
you set the constraints


182
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,632 line:-1
and the sizing for the button,


183
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,135 line:-2
if the button's width
is equal to the height,


184
00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:49.937 line:-1 align:center
you can create a perfect circle


185
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.073 line:-2 align:center
when the corner radius
is half of the width.


186
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,876 line:-2
Now, we turned
our default location button


187
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,346 line:-2
into a white circular button
with just simple adjustments.


188
00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:01.448 line:-2 align:center
We've just gone through
some stylistic changes


189
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,884 line:-2
that you can add
to Location Button.


190
00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.319 line:-1 align:center
You can customize the button


191
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,255 line:-2
to create the perfect look
that fits your app.


192
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,758 line:-2
However, with great power
comes great responsibility.


193
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,961 line:-2
When customizing
your Location Button,


194
00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:16.330 line:-2 align:center
there are some restrictions
that you might encounter


195
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,332 line:-2
to ensure
that your Location Button


196
00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:20.634 line:-1 align:center
is clear and visible.


197
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,603 line:-2
I wanna talk
about some examples


198
00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:24.037 line:-1 align:center
that you can expect


199
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:26,974 line:-2
if your button does not
seem to be drawn correctly


200
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,042 line:-1
or receive any location.


201
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,511 line:-1
If that's the case,


202
00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:32.613 line:-2 align:center
while your target-action
will be called,


203
00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:34.781 line:-1 align:center
you won't get authorization.


204
00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:36.350 line:-1 align:center
But don't worry.


205
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,852 line:-2
We'll give plenty of feedback
with log messages


206
00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:40.020 line:-1 align:center
to help you figure out


207
00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:42.022 line:-2 align:center
what restrictions
you're encountering.


208
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,223 line:-1
For example,


209
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:45,259 line:-2
these are just different
log messages


210
00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:48.495 line:-2 align:center
that refer to the insufficiency
of the button sizing,


211
00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:50.564 line:-1 align:center
alpha value, and color contrast


212
00:08:50.597 --> 00:08:53.267 line:-2 align:center
between tintColor
and backgroundColor.


213
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.235 line:-2 align:center
Now
let's go through some examples


214
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:56.870 line:-1 align:center
of what feedback you can expect


215
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:59,806 line:-2
if you're using Interface
Builder in Xcode.


216
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,576 line:-2
Continuing with the button
I have created earlier,


217
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,444 line:-2
if I was to change
the existing button


218
00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:06.446 line:-1 align:center
to have a white tintColor,


219
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,148 line:-2
people will not
be able to see this


220
00:09:08.182 --> 00:09:11.318 line:-2 align:center
because the button's background
color is already white.


221
00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:12.786 line:-1 align:center
So if you do this,


222
00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:15.489 line:-2 align:center
you will see this issue
shown in the navigation pane


223
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,724 line:-1
under the Issue tab in Xcode.


224
00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:19.993 line:-2 align:center
Instead, let's revert
our original button


225
00:09:20.027 --> 00:09:24.231 line:-2 align:center
and try to change the opacity,
or alpha, of this button.


226
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,766 line:-1
Maybe you can see this,


227
00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:28.435 line:-2 align:center
but to others,
it's a little too transparent,


228
00:09:28.468 --> 00:09:31.905 line:-2 align:center
and so it fails
our accessibility guidelines.


229
00:09:31.939 --> 00:09:34.942 line:-2 align:center
A similar issue statement
is produced in Xcode,


230
00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:37.511 line:-2 align:center
recommending you
to increase the alpha value.


231
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,646 line:-2
Another issue
you might encounter


232
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,783 line:-1
is insufficient button sizing.


233
00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:44.818 line:-2 align:center
This is when
the content of the button


234
00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:48.622 line:-2 align:center
is too small or too large
for the button size.


235
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,525 line:-2
Depending on the user's
localization setting,


236
00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:54.761 line:-2 align:center
the button's text length
can change.


237
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:58,599 line:-2
Now let's increase the text size
by changing the language.


238
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:03,170 line:-2
Depending on whether
your implementation


239
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,205 line:-1
is Auto-layout friendly,


240
00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:06.640 line:-1 align:center
if we change the language,


241
00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:09.576 line:-2 align:center
the size of the text
could outgrow the button.


242
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.846 line:-2 align:center
Notice that the text does
not fit the button in German.


243
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,147 line:-1
If this happens,


244
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,583 line:-2
look at the log messages
for feedback.


245
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,253 line:-2
Don't forget to test
your Location Button


246
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,055 line:-2
with really small
or really large text sizes,


247
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,825 line:-2
as well as testing it
in different languages


248
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:28,095 line:-2
to ensure that your button
is working in all cases.


249
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.597 line:-1 align:center
So, when customizing your button,


250
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:34.601 line:-2 align:center
remember that it's imperative
that it's clear and visible.


251
00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:37.104 line:-2 align:center
If your button does not
seem to be drawn correctly


252
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,672 line:-1
or receive location,


253
00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:41.308 line:-2 align:center
it could be that
it's no longer legible.


254
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.609 line:-1 align:center
If that's the case,


255
00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:44.611 line:-2 align:center
we provide log messages
for guidance


256
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,447 line:-2
to help you determine
what could be wrong.


257
00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.651 line:-2 align:center
Now that you know how
to implement Location Button,


258
00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:52.786 line:-2 align:center
you might wonder
how it will affect


259
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.355 line:-2 align:center
your existing
authorization status.


260
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,157 line:-1
As I mentioned before,


261
00:10:57.191 --> 00:10:59.560 line:-2 align:center
Location Button
is essentially giving you


262
00:10:59.593 --> 00:11:01.595 line:-1 align:center
Allow-Once authorization.


263
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,665 line:-2
If your app does not have
any authorization status


264
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:05,899 line:-1
of any kind,


265
00:11:05.933 --> 00:11:08.468 line:-2 align:center
it will have
"NotDetermined" authorization


266
00:11:08.502 --> 00:11:11.905 line:-2 align:center
with "When I Share" selected
in Privacy Settings.


267
00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:14.808 line:-2 align:center
If this is
your app's current state,


268
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,210 line:-1
then the very first time


269
00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:19.079 line:-2 align:center
each user presses
a Location Button,


270
00:11:19.112 --> 00:11:22.182 line:-2 align:center
this prompt will ask them to
confirm that they're on board.


271
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:25,953 line:-2
However, if your app is
already authorized for location,


272
00:11:25.986 --> 00:11:28.822 line:-2 align:center
such as "While Using
the App" state,


273
00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:30.991 line:-2 align:center
then using Location Button
will not change


274
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,292 line:-1
your existing state


275
00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:34.895 line:-2 align:center
and will behave
like any other UIButton.


276
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,163 line:-1
Where it works,


277
00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:39.433 line:-2 align:center
Location Button can feel
magical and also reassuring,


278
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,335 line:-2
because you're letting
people decide


279
00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:44.838 line:-2 align:center
when and whether their location
will be used each time.


280
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,608 line:-2
Since Location Button
is much more comfortable,


281
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:51,211 line:-2
we think people will be more
likely to give your app location


282
00:11:51.245 --> 00:11:54.414 line:-2 align:center
via Location Button
than they were previously.


283
00:11:54.448 --> 00:11:57.084 line:-2 align:center
So we wanna give users
and your app


284
00:11:57.117 --> 00:11:59.419 line:-2 align:center
another chance
to get off on the right foot.


285
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,156 line:-2
If someone, who has chosen
"Don't Allow" authorization


286
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,825 line:-1
on your app in the past


287
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,261 line:-1
taps our new Location Button,


288
00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:09.496 line:-2 align:center
they will see this button
introduction prompt


289
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,998 line:-1
and have the opportunity


290
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,333 line:-2
to move your app back
to NotDetermined


291
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,936 line:-2
and use Location Button
going on forward.


292
00:12:15.969 --> 00:12:17.704 line:-1 align:center
So in this session,


293
00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:20.140 line:-2 align:center
I talked about bringing
more dynamic abilities


294
00:12:20.174 --> 00:12:21.408 line:-1 align:center
to your watchOS apps


295
00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:24.044 line:-2 align:center
with Region-based
user notifications.


296
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,846 line:-2
If you're interested
in learning more,


297
00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:28.782 line:-2 align:center
don't forget to view
the resources with the session.


298
00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:30.951 line:-2 align:center
We've also covered
some cool new features


299
00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:34.288 line:-2 align:center
that can change the game
of how you can ask for location.


300
00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:37.257 line:-2 align:center
Giving people more control
over their data privacy


301
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:39.259 line:-1 align:center
is important to Apple.


302
00:12:39.293 --> 00:12:41.028 line:-2 align:center
People are increasingly
more aware


303
00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:43.597 line:-2 align:center
of how their data
is being shared.


304
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.032 line:-1 align:center
When designing your app


305
00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:47.768 line:-2 align:center
to provide the most amazing
user experience,


306
00:12:47.801 --> 00:12:50.604 line:-2 align:center
but also build trust
with your customers,


307
00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:52.573 line:-1 align:center
you might want to ask yourself:


308
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:56,076 line:-2
"Does my app require
traditional authorization,


309
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,846 line:-2
or would a one-time
location authorization


310
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,115 line:-2
with Location Button
be more suitable?"


311
00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:07.087 line:-2 align:center
And the answer, in some cases,
might be that once is enough.


312
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,422 line:-1
With Location Button,


313
00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.257 line:-1 align:center
you can gain trust with people


314
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,892 line:-1
by giving more control


315
00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:14.494 line:-2 align:center
about when they want
to share their location.


316
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:15,596 line:-1
Thank you.


317
