00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:12,846 line:-1
on the CloudKit team.


8
00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:16.583 line:-1 position:50%
Today, I’m excited to introduce
you to CloudKit Console.


9
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,986 line:-1
iCloud is an incredibly
powerful service


10
00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:21.488 line:-1 position:50%
for expanding the capability
of your users’ devices


11
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,789 line:-1
to the cloud.


12
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,324 line:-1
Millions of people use iCloud


13
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,895 line:-1
to store their photos,
files, and data securely.


14
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,464 line:-1
CloudKit, the database
behind iCloud,


15
00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.966 line:-1 position:50%
can efficiently and seamlessly
synchronize content


16
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.570 line:-1 position:50%
across devices
for a magical experience.


17

And being cloud-based,


18
00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:39.907 line:-1 position:50%
CloudKit services

20
00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:46.213 line:-1 position:50%
Today, I’m excited to show you
CloudKit Console,


21
00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:47.881 line:-1 position:50%
a redesigned set
of dashboard tools


22
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,650 line:-1
that help you manage
how your applications


23
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.486 line:-1 position:50%
interact with CloudKit services.


24
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,155 line:-1
In the Console, you can access
and manage CloudKit database


25
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,724 line:-1
and view telemetry and logs
in a fresh new interface


26
00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:01.261 line:-1 position:50%
that makes it easier than ever
to get things done.


27
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,629 line:-1
Throughout the Console,


28
00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.665 line:-1 position:50%
the content follows the same
familiar structure


29
00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.334 line:-1 position:50%
that you're used to
with other Apple applications:


30
00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:09.970 line:-1 position:50%
context and account information
on the top,


31
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.139 line:-1 position:50%
navigation and properties
on the left,


32
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,207 line:-1
and details in the middle.


33
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,843 line:-1
From this new layout,
you can easily select a feature,


34
00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.846 line:-1 position:50%
then dive deeper
into the details.


35
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,748 line:-1
Let’s start by looking
at a few features


36
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.551 line:-1 position:50%
in the new Database app.


37
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,420 line:0
In case you're new
to CloudKit database,


38
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,288 line:0
the short story
is that CloudKit databases


39
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,058 line:0
exist within a container
defined for your use case,


40
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:33,360 line:0
and developers use
two database environments:


41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,796 line:0
development and production.


42
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,532 position:50%
Database schemas are promoted
from development to production


43
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,968 line:0
once the app developer
is comfortable with the changes


44
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:43,136 position:50%
they made during development.


45
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,471 line:0
As you’re getting started,


46
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,007 line:0
you can iterate quickly
on development databases


47
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,076 line:0
using just-in-time
schema creation


48
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:53,080 position:50%
or by defining your
data model in the Console.


49
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,183 line:0
When you're ready, you can
deploy the schema to production


50
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,652 line:0
and CloudKit will verify
the integrity of the updates


51
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,989 line:0
to avoid breaking older clients
of your database.


52
00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.423 line:-1 position:50%
As I launch the Database app,


53
00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:08.128 line:-1 position:50%
I can see a list of containers
owned by my developer team.


54
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.930 line:-1 position:50%
The next time
I launch the Console,


55
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.700 line:-1 position:50%
it will bring me straight
to the last container I visited.


56
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.303 line:-1 position:50%
I’ve selected the Development
environment in the dropdown,


57
00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:17.971 line:-1 position:50%
and now let’s look
at the Schema section


58
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.308 line:-1 position:50%
to explore how
record types are defined.


59
00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:23.410 line:-1 position:50%
Record types are used
to define data structures


60
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,978 line:-1
in CloudKit database.


61
00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.849 line:-1 position:50%
I can quickly view the list
of existing record types,


62
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:32,886 line:-1
and then click to see details
on the fields and indexes.


63
00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.654 line:-1 position:50%
Adding a field is simple.


64
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,392 line:-1
I just provide a name
for my new field,


65
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:41,595 line:-1
and choose
its corresponding type.


66
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:51.838 line:-1 position:50%
Managing indexes in the Console
is also straightforward.


67
00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:55.142 line:-1 position:50%
From this page, I can easily
view the existing indexes,


68
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:58,145 line:-1
or click to create a new index
by selecting a field


69
00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:00.847 line:-1 position:50%
and choosing one of the three
index types.


70
00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.682 line:-1 position:50%
Here, I’m adding
a sortable index


71
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,752 line:-1
to alphabetically
sort the author field.


72
00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.254 line:-1 position:50%
And while I’m managing
the schema,


73
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,623 line:-1
let's take a quick look at
how security roles are managed


74
00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:11.758 line:-1 position:50%
for the public database.


75
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,093 line:-1
If you've used CloudKit before,


76
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,895 line:-1
you may already
be using security roles


77
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,231 line:-1
to manage access to records
in your public database.


78
00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.468 line:-1 position:50%
And now there's a new UI
that makes them easier than ever


79
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,737 line:-1
to define and manage.


80
00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:31.311 line:-1 position:50%
Now that I have a schema
defined for my app,


81
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.380 line:-1 position:50%
let’s use the Console
to explore some data


82
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.148 line:-1 position:50%
that I’ve stored
during development.


83
00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:38.318 line:-1 position:50%
From this view, I can either
create or view records.


84
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,954 line:-1
The new UI presents
a left-to-right flow


85
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,190 line:-1
for selecting context
of how I want to retrieve


86
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,159 line:-1
records for display,
starting with the database,


87
00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.629 line:-1 position:50%
then the zone,
and finally the record type.


88
00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:56.436 line:-1 position:50%
Once I set the context, I can
see records in the list view


89
00:03:56.436 --> 00:04:02.209 line:-1 position:50%
and see their details
in the detail view.


90
00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.977 line:-1 position:50%
If I need to refine the request,


91
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,446 line:-1
I can use the new query builder
to apply filters


92
00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:11.918 line:-1 position:50%
so I can get to
the exact records I want.


93
00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.087 line:-1 position:50%
So let’s say that I’m building
a feature for my app


94
00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.590 line:-1 position:50%
that writes a new record type
into CloudKit,


95
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,859 line:-1
and I want to verify
what CloudKit actually receives


96
00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.027 line:-1 position:50%
in the development environment.


97
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,262 line:-1
With the new UI,


98
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:26.466 line:-1 position:50%
I can simply set up
the query once, save it...


99
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:31,204 line:-1
[KEYSTROKES]


100
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,606 line:-1
...and then come back
to it again


101
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:36.109 line:-1 position:50%
as my development
moves forward.


102
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.982 line:-1 position:50%
The URLs used
throughout the Console


103
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:45,452 line:-1
are also structured to point
directly to specific features.


104
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,419 line:-1
So for example,


105
00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.122 line:-1 position:50%
if I want to have
fast access to the record view,


106
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,059 line:-1
I can just add that direct link
to my Safari bookmarks.


107
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,294 line:-1
With the new Console,


108
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,863 line:-1
managing your data and schema
is quick and intuitive,


109
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:01,001 line:-1
with a familiar user experience
across each feature.


110
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,769 line:-1
Now that I’ve created a schema
and confirmed


111
00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:05.138 line:-1 position:50%
that I have the right data
stored in development,


112
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,775 line:-1
I’m ready to deploy the schema
to the production environment.


113
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,010 line:-1
Earlier, I mentioned
the difference


114
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,478 line:-1
between development
and production,


115
00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:13.713 line:-1 position:50%
so let me show you how
the Console makes it easier


116
00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:17.117 line:-1 position:50%
and safer to deploy
a schema to production.


117
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,753 line:-1
Clicking "Deploy Schema Changes"
brings me to a clean,


118
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,588 line:-1
actionable view of the changes
that will be applied


119
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,024 line:-1
to my production deployment.


120
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,959 line:-1
Here, I can see everything
that’s changed


121
00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:28.962 line:-1 position:50%
between my previous production
schema and the changes


122
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:33,567 line:-1
that would be applied from
the development environment.


123
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,802 line:-1
Since production changes
cannot be reversed,


124
00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:38.171 line:-1 position:50%
this diff view gives me
a quick way to confirm


125
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.639 line:-1 position:50%
that only my intended changes


126
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,908 line:-1
end up in the production
environment.


127
00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:44.077 line:-1 position:50%
That’s it for the features
in the new Database app,


128
00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:46.479 line:-1 position:50%
so now let’s take a look
at Telemetry.


129
00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.814 line:-1 position:50%
After setting up the database


130
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,683 line:-1
and promoting my schema
to production,


131
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,018 line:-1
I’m moving to the next part
of the developer lifecycle


132
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,520 line:-1
where I can observe
and investigate


133
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,189 line:-1
how my app is
interacting with CloudKit.


134
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.857 line:-1 position:50%
The Telemetry app
within the Console


135
00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.227 line:-1 position:50%
gives me a number of charts
that show key metrics


136
00:06:00.227 --> 00:06:03.263 line:-1 position:50%
about how my app is interacting
with the database.


137
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,032 line:-1
Request rate, server latency,
error count,


138
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,134 line:-1
and average request size
are all shown


139
00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:11.638 line:-1 position:50%
in filterable charts that
help me find the data I need.


140
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:12,973 line:-1
These charts
can help me identify


141
00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:15.141 line:-1 position:50%
when my app behavior
changes over time


142
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,011 line:-1
and give me a signal about
whether a new version of my app


143
00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:20.647 line:-1 position:50%
is behaving in unexpected ways.


144
00:06:20.647 --> 00:06:23.883 line:-1 position:50%
Now let’s take a look
at the Logs app.


145
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,387 line:-1
The Logs app within the Console
lets me dive even deeper.


146
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.889 line:-1 position:50%
It shows detailed logging output
from CloudKit Database


147
00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.426 line:-1 position:50%
so I can see how my app requests
have actually been processed.


148
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,763 line:-1
This app is a great tool for
debugging and investigations,


149
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,533 line:-1
both during development
and in production.


150
00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.569 line:-1 position:50%
We think you’re going to love
using CloudKit Console


151
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,272 line:-1
as you’re developing
and shipping your apps.


152
00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:47.707 line:-1 position:50%
I hope you’ll spend some time
trying the new schema management


153
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,577 line:-1
and querying capabilities
in the Database app


154
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.245 line:-1 position:50%
and review
the new instrumentation


155
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,447 line:-1
in the Logs and Telemetry apps
that give you


156
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,984 line:-1
actionable information
about how you’re using CloudKit.


157
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,520 line:-1
We’re also excited to have
brand-new documentation


158
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.289 line:-1 position:50%
