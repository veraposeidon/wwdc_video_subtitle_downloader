00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:12,045 line:-2
[Arun] Hi, my name is Arun,
and I'm a system engineer


4
00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.547 line:-1 align:center
in the Wireless team.


5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.282 line:-2 align:center
Today, I'm gonna take you
on a journey


6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,784 line:-1
to explore UWB-based car keys.


7
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,656 line:-2
Last year, we launched car keys
with the ability


8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,659 line:-2
to use your iPhone
or Apple Watch to unlock, lock,


9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,928 line:-2
and start your car,
share your keys


10
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,631 line:-2
with family and friends,
and even manage them remotely.


11
00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.000 line:-2 align:center
And you can do all
of that knowing that the system


12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,802 line:-2
has been designed to be
secure and private.


13
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,605 line:-2
This year, we are excited
to extend the capabilities


14
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,640 line:-1
of car keys.


15
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,842 line:-2
In this session,
we will look at the new features


16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,277 line:-1
and how to integrate them.


17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,013 line:-2
If you want to learn
the basics of the car keys,


18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,982 line:-2
including provisioning,
key management, and NFC,


19
00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:52.719 line:-2 align:center
check out last year's talk,
"Introducing car keys."


20
00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:53.854 line:-1 align:center
One of the key features


21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,923 line:-2
we are enabling this year
is passive entry.


22
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:59,159 line:-2
Using UWB technology,
you can now lock, unlock,


23
00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:01.195 line:-2 align:center
and start your car
while leaving iPhone


24
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:05,399 line:-2
in your bag or pocket,
or Apple Watch on your wrist.


25
00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.268 line:-2 align:center
RKE, or remote keyless
entry controls,


26
00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:11.104 line:-2 align:center
allow you to use your iPhone
or Watch to lock,


27
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,840 line:-2
unlock,
and perform other actions


28
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,876 line:-2
when you're in Bluetooth range
of your car.


29
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,812 line:-2
And cars can now personalize
settings by identifying


30
00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:22.416 line:-2 align:center
which digital key is entering
the car through which door.


31
00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.618 line:-2 align:center
There are other features
that we will not be able


32
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:25.786 line:-1 align:center
to cover in this session,


33
00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.188 line:-2 align:center
such as pairing your device
as Car Key


34
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,591 line:-2
and Friend First Approach,
but experiences


35
00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:33.327 line:-2 align:center
for these features
have also been upgraded.


36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,596 line:-2
Now, let's take a look
at the technologies


37
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,631 line:-1
that enable these features.


38
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,801 line:-2
The U1 chip
with UWB technology allows cars


39
00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.505 line:-2 align:center
to determine the precise
location of nearby car key.


40
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:47,541 line:-2
UWB is also the basis
of a secure-ranging protocol


41
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,311 line:-2
for stronger protection against
replay and relay attacks.


42
00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.881 line:-2 align:center
The Secure Element is
a protected hardware unit


43
00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:55.983 line:-1 align:center
integrated into Apple devices.


44
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:59,853 line:-2
In addition to storing car keys
and authenticating credentials,


45
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,022 line:-2
we have expanded the use
of Secure Element


46
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,993 line:-2
to derive session-specific
UWB ranging keys.


47
00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:10.130 line:-2 align:center
Bluetooth LE, or BLE,
is used as communication channel


48
00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.833 line:-2 align:center
between the car
and the Apple device,


49
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,102 line:-2
to exchange data
during authentication


50
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,704 line:-2
and to manage
secure-ranging sessions.


51
00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:20.707 line:-2 align:center
BLE's also used
as the anchor point


52
00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:24.144 line:-2 align:center
to initialize
a secure-ranging time grid.


53
00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:27.014 line:-2 align:center
And finally,
to ensure a common solution


54
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,383 line:-2
with cross-platform support,
Apple,


55
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,218 line:-2
along with other industry
partners,


56
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.320 line:-2 align:center
has been leading efforts
to create


57
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:38,392 line:-2
a standard specification at
the Car Connectivity Consortium.


58
00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:43.497 line:-2 align:center
At Apple, security and privacy
are part of our core values.


59
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,968 line:-2
This UWB passive entry solution
was designed with both in mind.


60
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,070 line:-1
Keys are unique to each session


61
00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.472 line:-2 align:center
and are derived
upon each connection.


62
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,475 line:-2
Some of these session keys
are used to encrypt messages


63
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.412 line:-2 align:center
at the link layer,
while others to ensure


64
00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:02.516 line:-2 align:center
that your devices can't be
tracked using UWB or BLE.


65
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,186 line:-2
We use random identifiers,
derived from these session keys.


66
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,489 line:-2
These identifiers are then
periodically rotated.


67
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,426 line:-2
And most importantly,
we strengthened the security


68
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,161 line:-1
of UWB-based localization


69
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:17.831 line:-2 align:center
by building
a secure-ranging protocol.


70
00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:21.001 line:-2 align:center
This secure-ranging protocol
is a two-way ranging protocol


71
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,437 line:-1
with a three-packet exchange.


72
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,472 line:-1
Think of it as "ping-pong-ping"


73
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,407 line:-2
where iPhone sends
a poll message,


74
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,344 line:-2
and the car answers
with a respond message,


75
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,915 line:-2
and iPhone sends another
poll message for added accuracy.


76
00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:39.486 line:-2 align:center
Each of these messages carry
a scrambled time stamp, or STS,


77
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.555 line:-2 align:center
which is
a cryptographically-generated


78
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,323 line:-1
and time-bounded packet,


79
00:03:43.357 --> 00:03:46.460 line:-2 align:center
meaning that even a verified
packet can only be accepted


80
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:50,330 line:-2
for the time slot slot which was
used to generate this STS,


81
00:03:50.364 --> 00:03:54.835 line:-2 align:center
providing extra security against
replay and relay attacks.


82
00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:57.437 line:-2 align:center
So, how do we bring all
of this together?


83
00:03:57.471 --> 00:04:01.141 line:-2 align:center
Well, each car defines a series
of virtual zones.


84
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:04,745 line:-2
These zones have associated
features that can be triggered


85
00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:07.447 line:-2 align:center
when a device
with a valid and active key


86
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:12.152 line:-2 align:center
is localized entering
or exiting these zones.


87
00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:14.888 line:-2 align:center
The wider zone activates
welcome features,


88
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,691 line:-2
such as turning on lights
or pre-warming the cabin


89
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,195 line:-1
when you approach the car.


90
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,497 line:-2
The zone
closest to the car typically


91
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.134 line:-2 align:center
unlocks the door
when you approach.


92
00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:31.205 line:-2 align:center
And the lock zone secures
the cars when you walk away.


93
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,876 line:-2
So, how does a car detect
you in these zones?


94
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,145 line:-2
Well, to localize
the paired device


95
00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:41.849 line:-2 align:center
inside these virtual zones,
cars are equipped


96
00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:44.484 line:-2 align:center
with multiple UWB
and BLE transceivers


97
00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:46.987 line:-1 align:center
to ensure 360-degree coverage.


98
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.456 line:-2 align:center
When the user first
approaches the car,


99
00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:53.260 line:-2 align:center
your iPhone or Apple Watch
is detected using BLE.


100
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,396 line:-2
Upon proximity detection,
a communication channel


101
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.665 line:-1 align:center
with the car is established.


102
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,702 line:-2
Upon connection,
car authenticates the device,


103
00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:05.105 line:-2 align:center
and a shared ranging key
is derived on both sides.


104
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,408 line:-2
This operation takes place
inside the Secure Element,


105
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:13,113 line:-2
and generates a key
that is unique to each session.


106
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,950 line:-2
The derived key is used to start
a secure-ranging session


107
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:20,554 line:-2
with UWB transceivers,
which allows the car


108
00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:23.657 line:-2 align:center
to localize the device
and map its trajectory.


109
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.126 line:-2 align:center
This is computed
by the localization algorithm


110
00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.128 line:-1 align:center
that runs inside the car.


111
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.130 line:-1 align:center
We'll come back to it later.


112
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.533 line:-2 align:center
The car continues
to map the trajectory


113
00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:35.869 line:-2 align:center
of the device
as the user approaches the car.


114
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,839 line:-2
Based on the location
and trajectory of the device,


115
00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:41.508 line:-2 align:center
the car can decide
to trigger welcome features,


116
00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:45.078 line:-2 align:center
such as turning on lights
or adjusting seats.


117
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:48,348 line:-2
And when the device is localized
inside the unlock zone,


118
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,684 line:-2
the car can
initiate unlock operations


119
00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:53.720 line:-2 align:center
before the user
touches the door handle.


120
00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:56.990 line:-2 align:center
With precise knowledge
of whether the user's device is


121
00:05:57.024 --> 00:06:00.827 line:-2 align:center
inside or outside the car,
the engine only starts


122
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,566 line:-2
when a device with a valid key
is detected inside the car.


123
00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.568 line:-1 align:center
And one of my favorite features,


124
00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:10.470 line:-2 align:center
now you get to enjoy
this UWB-based experience


125
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,806 line:-2
even when your phone
is in power reserve mode.


126
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,376 line:-2
So, after a long day of hiking
or backpacking, if you find


127
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.446 line:-2 align:center
that your phone needs to be
charged, there may still be


128
00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.784 line:-2 align:center
enough power in the battery
to get you back on the road.


129
00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:26.620 line:-2 align:center
Now that you've seen how
passive entry works,


130
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:30,324 line:-2
let's take a look at the remote
keyless entry controls.


131
00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:32.025 line:-1 align:center
Remote actions are useful


132
00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:33.727 line:-2 align:center
when you're farther
from the car.


133
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,697 line:-2
You can use them by preheating
the cabin in the winter,


134
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.066 line:-2 align:center
or find your car
by honking the horn.


135
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,835 line:-2
And many actions can
be triggered directly


136
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,704 line:-1
from within Wallet.


137
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,940 line:-2
You can also use device to view
information about the car,


138
00:06:46.974 --> 00:06:49.443 line:-2 align:center
such as lock state,
its fuel level,


139
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,445 line:-1
or battery-charging state.


140
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,448 line:-2
Remote actions are sent
over Bluetooth LE.


141
00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:56.850 line:-2 align:center
Since they are independent
of UWB,


142
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,386 line:-2
they work even outside
of UWB range.


143
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,222 line:-2
And finally, remote actions
are standardized


144
00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:04.358 line:-2 align:center
at
the Car Connectivity Consortium,


145
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,059 line:-2
so there's
a common implementation


146
00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:07.995 line:-1 align:center
for all the cars and devices.


147
00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:10.163 line:-2 align:center
For the best experience,
we recommend


148
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:14,134 line:-2
that automakers implement all
the applicable remote actions,


149
00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:17.371 line:-2 align:center
and not just remote lock
and unlock.


150
00:07:17.404 --> 00:07:20.340 line:-2 align:center
Let's look at how does Remote
Keyless entry control works.


151
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:24,444 line:-2
To trigger a remote command,
the device requests a challenge


152
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,915 line:-2
for the associated action,
which is used as an input


153
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,317 line:-2
to generate
the device signature.


154
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,420 line:-2
The car verifies the device
signature against the challenge,


155
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,957 line:-2
the associated action,
and other information.


156
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.692 line:-1 align:center
If verification succeeds,


157
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:42,429 line:-2
the car performs the action
and notifies the device.


158
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,966 line:-2
With digital car keys,
cars can now automatically


159
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,535 line:-2
personalize settings,
like cabin temperature,


160
00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:52.673 line:-2 align:center
seat position, seat heating,
and more, by observing


161
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:56,109 line:-2
which digital key is
approaching the driver's door.


162
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,912 line:-2
Today's car keys can
support personalization, too,


163
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,481 line:-2
but they rely
on drivers always knowing


164
00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:04.885 line:-2 align:center
which key fob has
which user setting.


165
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,021 line:-2
Now, with your car key
on iPhone or Apple Watch,


166
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,857 line:-2
you don't have to worry
about that.


167
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,458 line:-2
With precise trajectory
and the knowledge


168
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,560 line:-2
and the knowledge
that the personal devices


169
00:08:13.594 --> 00:08:16.263 line:-2 align:center
are strongly tied
to individual users,


170
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,232 line:-2
cars can personalize
experiences


171
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:21,235 line:-2
with greater confidence
than ever before.


172
00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:22.803 line:-1 align:center
And this works seamlessly,


173
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,806 line:-2
even when multiple users
are approaching the car.


174
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.742 line:-2 align:center
To sum it up, we are excited
about these new features


175
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:32,579 line:-2
and look forward to automakers
launching UWB-based cars,


176
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,549 line:-2
so our users can start
enjoying these features


177
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:39,920 line:-2
on iPhones and Apple Watches
equipped with U1 chip.


178
00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:42.689 line:-2 align:center
Now, let's shift gears and talk
about how automakers


179
00:08:42.723 --> 00:08:45.292 line:-2 align:center
can get on-boarded
on the Apple platform,


180
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,895 line:-2
and some of the areas
you will want to focus on


181
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,464 line:-2
when designing
a car key solution.


182
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,834 line:-2
As part of this discussion,
we'll cover system architecture,


183
00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:57.137 line:-2 align:center
time synchronization,
transceiver synchronization,


184
00:08:57,171 --> 00:09:00,240 line:-2
and about building a good
localization algorithm.


185
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,543 line:-2
Let's start
with system architecture.


186
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:05,445 line:-2
Since the passive entry
solution relies on reliable


187
00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:09.082 line:-2 align:center
and accurate localization,
it's essential that your system


188
00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:11.752 line:-2 align:center
has good performance
and low latency.


189
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,688 line:-2
As we saw earlier,
each car is equipped


190
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:18,158 line:-2
with multiple transceivers,
and one of your first decisions


191
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:21,762 line:-2
will be to select
a suitable transceiver.


192
00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:24.731 line:-2 align:center
First, you need to ensure
that the transceivers


193
00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:26.767 line:-2 align:center
can provide
sufficient link budget.


194
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.670 line:-2 align:center
Since the car key protocol
is bi-directional,


195
00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:33.307 line:-2 align:center
this means evaluating both
the Tx-radiated power


196
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,178 line:-2
and Rx sensitivity for good
uplink and downlink performance.


197
00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:43.350 line:-2 align:center
By fine-tuning the antenna
directivity, you can ensure


198
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,086 line:-2
that transceiver's antenna
supports the entire field


199
00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:48.889 line:-2 align:center
of view
for the required coverage.


200
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:53,160 line:-2
Antenna diversity is critical
to achieve good operating range.


201
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,296 line:-2
For example,
the use of two or more antennas


202
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.733 line:-2 align:center
with different polarization
or separation can help


203
00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.503 line:-2 align:center
improve
received signal strength.


204
00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:05.172 line:-2 align:center
Finally,
you need to ensure that the 3D


205
00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:07.908 line:-2 align:center
time-of-flight measurements
are highly accurate.


206
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,744 line:-2
Passive entry
and localization features rely


207
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,247 line:-2
on time-of-flight
in their calculations.


208
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.783 line:-2 align:center
Therefore, the accuracy must
be within defined bounds,


209
00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:19.486 line:-2 align:center
regardless
of the approach angle.


210
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.623 line:-2 align:center
Since even well-designed
individual transceivers can


211
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:25,359 line:-2
result in insufficient
coverage around the car,


212
00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:28.695 line:-2 align:center
or coverage in unwanted areas
if they are poorly installed,


213
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,598 line:-2
you will need to identify
the best possible positions


214
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,901 line:-2
to place transceivers
around the car


215
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,303 line:-2
to provide
necessary coverage and,


216
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,705 line:-2
at the same time, you will want
to limit the number


217
00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:43.076 line:-2 align:center
of transceivers to a minimum
to keep costs down.


218
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,380 line:-2
Be sure to consider
height and orientation.


219
00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:48.749 line:-2 align:center
In general, the greater
the installation height,


220
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,518 line:-2
the farther the fading point,
and better the range.


221
00:10:51.552 --> 00:10:52.953 line:-1 align:center
This obviously has to be done


222
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,322 line:-2
within the design constraints
of the car.


223
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:59,326 line:-2
Similarly, poor orientation can
result in gaps in coverage


224
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:04,097 line:-2
or coverage in unwanted areas,
such as above the car.


225
00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:06.166 line:-2 align:center
Once you have
the suitable transceivers


226
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,768 line:-1
and potential positions,


227
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:11,705 line:-2
the next step is to verify
the system RF performance.


228
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,607 line:-1
Examine the radiation pattern


229
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.310 line:-2 align:center
of the transceivers
installed around the car


230
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:20,414 line:-2
to ensure a symmetrical
coverage on all sides.


231
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,183 line:-2
You also want to pay attention
to the maximum range


232
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:24,618 line:-1
covered by the system.


233
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:26.920 line:-2 align:center
This is important
for long distance features,


234
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:30,858 line:-2
such as welcome lights
or preconditioning the cabin.


235
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:33.594 line:-2 align:center
And most importantly,
you will want to ensure


236
00:11:33.627 --> 00:11:36.296 line:-2 align:center
that the system has
sufficient link margin buffer,


237
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.799 line:-2 align:center
to ensure an unlock operation
can take place,


238
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,401 line:-2
regardless of damping caused
by the human body,


239
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:45,806 line:-2
channel shadowing, fading,
or other variables.


240
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,809 line:-2
Another area you need
to consider is system latency.


241
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,178 line:-2
When you approach the car,
a complex sequence


242
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,314 line:-2
of events begins, starting with
the setup of a BLE connection,


243
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,984 line:-2
authentication,
and key derivation,


244
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,286 line:-2
followed by a secure-ranging
session setup,


245
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,989 line:-2
where each
UWB transceiver starts scanning,


246
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:05,926 line:-2
so the car can determine
the location of the device.


247
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,028 line:-2
All these tasks must be
completed


248
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,831 line:-2
before the user attempts
to open the door.


249
00:12:10.864 --> 00:12:14.334 line:-2 align:center
To keep the system latency
within the required bounds,


250
00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:17.104 line:-2 align:center
you will need a high-performance
crypto processor


251
00:12:17.137 --> 00:12:20.574 line:-2 align:center
for authentication
and key management.


252
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,976 line:-2
The bus system that connects
your ECU


253
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,712 line:-2
to each transceiver
must be of low latency;


254
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,383 line:-2
a slow bus can really impact
system op performance.


255
00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:32.853 line:-2 align:center
Finally, you will need
a flexible software architecture


256
00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:35.389 line:-2 align:center
that allows you to support
optimization techniques,


257
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,157 line:-2
be it multi-threaded
applications


258
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:40,594 line:-2
or incorporation
of time synchronization.


259
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:44,064 line:-2
Now, let's quickly talk
about time synchronization.


260
00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.800 line:-2 align:center
UWB transceivers needs
to be actively scanning


261
00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:48.702 line:-1 align:center
to detect ranging packets.


262
00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:50.804 line:-2 align:center
Without good time
synchronization,


263
00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:52.472 line:-1 align:center
long-scanning windows are needed


264
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:55,108 line:-2
to reliably capture
incoming packets.


265
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,912 line:-2
This consumes power
and processing time.


266
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,548 line:-2
By implementing
a precise time synchronization


267
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:04,384 line:-2
across your system,
each transceiver can know


268
00:13:04.418 --> 00:13:06.820 line:-2 align:center
when incoming packets are
expected


269
00:13:06.854 --> 00:13:09.857 line:-2 align:center
to an accuracy
of tens of microsecond.


270
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.259 line:-2 align:center
By only scanning
during these time windows,


271
00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:15.395 line:-2 align:center
not only can you conserve power,
and improve performance


272
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,798 line:-2
in multi-session
and congested environments,


273
00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:20.634 line:-2 align:center
but it also helps you
localize the device faster.


274
00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:23.737 line:-2 align:center
It does that by ensuring
successful ranging


275
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,706 line:-2
from the very first
detected cycle


276
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:30,177 line:-2
by keeping the transceivers
tightly synchronized.


277
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:34.681 line:-2 align:center
Another important technique is
transceiver synchronization.


278
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:37,518 line:-2
Sometimes,
some transceivers may fail


279
00:13:37.551 --> 00:13:40.354 line:-2 align:center
to connect or become out
of sync.


280
00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:42.890 line:-2 align:center
By implementing transceiver
synchronization,


281
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,158 line:-2
transceivers that are
successfully synchronized


282
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:48,262 line:-2
with the device can share
timing information


283
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,198 line:-2
with other transceivers
in the car,


284
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,000 line:-1
and help them quickly connect,


285
00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:56.403 line:-2 align:center
or even compute time-of-flight,
even when they have failed


286
00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:59.039 line:-2 align:center
to finish
the full-ranging cycle.


287
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:02,576 line:-2
Last but not least,
localization algorithm.


288
00:14:02.609 --> 00:14:05.012 line:-2 align:center
One of the most important
task when designing


289
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,314 line:-2
a passive-entry solution
is the development


290
00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:10.484 line:-2 align:center
of a localization algorithm
that can pinpoint the location


291
00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:14.121 line:-2 align:center
of approaching devices
relative to the car.


292
00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:16.223 line:-2 align:center
A localization algorithm
is a piece


293
00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:18.625 line:-2 align:center
of code
running on your car's ECU.


294
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,294 line:-1
It collects device's distance


295
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,797 line:-2
from each connected UWB
transceivers and process them


296
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,634 line:-2
to locate the iPhone
or Apple Watch in space.


297
00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:29.570 line:-1 align:center
There are many ways to do this.


298
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:33,073 line:-2
One simple example of this is
true-range multi-lateration.


299
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:36,243 line:-2
The localization algorithm is
one of the most crucial pieces


300
00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:39.313 line:-2 align:center
of the solution
that you need to develop.


301
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,115 line:-2
So, you will need to ensure
that your localization algorithm


302
00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:45.385 line:-2 align:center
is fast and accurate,
whether it wants to follow


303
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,988 line:-2
the trajectory of the user
as they approach the car,


304
00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:52.059 line:-2 align:center
or determine whether the device
is inside or outside the cabin.


305
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:55,562 line:-2
Speed, accuracy,
and precision are the key


306
00:14:55.596 --> 00:14:58.899 line:-2 align:center
to a good localization solution,
even when you are adding support


307
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,969 line:-2
for a single
transceiver-based unlock system.


308
00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:04.571 line:-2 align:center
You may also need to adjust
your localization algorithm


309
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:07,374 line:-2
for different cabin types
and physical characteristics


310
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,876 line:-1
of the car.


311
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,612 line:-2
Now, you've seen how
the car key feature works.


312
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,413 line:-2
If you're interested
in development,


313
00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:15.182 line:-2 align:center
we recommend
the following workflow


314
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,750 line:-1
for an organic progression


315
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,419 line:-2
of software development
and qualification.


316
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,955 line:-2
First, focus
on UWB interoperability


317
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:24,725 line:-2
and ensure that it follows
the specification.


318

We have created a tool
that helps you test this.


319
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:30.797 line:-2 align:center
It also lets you progressively
enable cryptographic operations,


320
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:34.701 line:-2 align:center
so you can develop your system
in a step-by-step manner.


321
00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:38.305 line:-2 align:center
Next, integrate the BLE layer
for connection management


322
00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:40.073 line:-1 align:center
and owner pairing.


323
00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:42.309 line:-2 align:center
Then, focus on secure-ranging
management,


324
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,578 line:-2
which is
crucial for passive entry.


325
00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:47.481 line:-2 align:center
Last but not least,
support remote actions


326
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:50,951 line:-1
for control at a distance.


327
00:15:50.984 --> 00:15:52.786 line:-2 align:center
If you're interested
in learning more,


328
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,421 line:-1
we encourage you to participate


329
00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.256 line:-2 align:center
in
the Car Connectivity Consortium,


330
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,092 line:-2
and enroll in the MFi Program
for specific details


331
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,395 line:-2
on working
with iPhone and Apple Watch.


332
00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:04.565 line:-2 align:center
The MFi Program is where you can
obtain additional documents


333
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:07,434 line:-2
and tools to assist
in your development.


334
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,736 line:-1
Thank you, and have a great day!
