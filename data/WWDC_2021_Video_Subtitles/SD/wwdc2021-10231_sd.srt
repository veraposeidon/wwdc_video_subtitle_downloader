Ryan Chapman: Hello
and welcome to WWDC.


7
00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.314 line:-1 position:50%
Hi, I'm Ryan Chapman,


8
00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.217 line:-1 position:50%
and I work on
the Proactive Intelligence team.


9
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,286 line:-1
Today I'll be talking to you
about how you can expand


10
00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:22.890 line:-1 position:50%
your app's presence
with intent donations.


11
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.591 line:-1 position:50%
Our device's operating systems
have become


12
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.862 line:-1 position:50%
increasingly integrated with
the apps people use day to day.


13
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,531 line:-1
This collaboration between
the system and apps


14
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.501 line:-1 position:50%
is at the heart of an
intelligent system experience


15
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.104 line:-1 position:50%
that gives our users
superpowers.


16
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,573 line:-1
One of the primary ways
your apps can participate


17
00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:42.709 line:-1 position:50%
in this collaboration
and expand your app's presence


18
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,012 line:-1
and capabilities
throughout the system


19
00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:47.514 line:-1 position:50%
is by donating intents.


20
00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.918 line:-1 position:50%
In this session, I'll define
what intent donations are,


21
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,620 line:-1
walk you through
the life of an intent donation,


22
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.255 line:-1 position:50%
and then talk to you
about how you can


23
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,691 line:-1
structure your donations
for success


24
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:02.195 line:-1 position:50%
and ultimately expand your app's
presence across the system.


25
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,864 line:-1
Let's go ahead and start out
with understanding


26
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:06,066 line:-1
what intent donations are.


27
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:10.037 line:-1 position:50%
Three years ago in iOS 12,
we introduced Shortcuts.


28
00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:12.406 line:-1 position:50%
Shortcuts let you expose
the capabilities of your app


29
00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.241 line:-1 position:50%
as actions.


30
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.576 line:-1 position:50%
They enable people
to use your app's features


31
00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:21.181 line:-1 position:50%
in new ways and places
across the operating system.


32
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.417 line:-1 position:50%
It's a really powerful way
to engage your users


33
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:27,621 line:-1
and expand your presence
beyond the confines of your app.


34
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,691 line:-1
Every action that you expose
should be accelerative,


35
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,794 line:-1
by performing a key function
of your app.


36
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:34,895 line:-1
That means it should
take something


37
00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:37.230 line:-1 position:50%
that the user already
wanted to do with your app


38
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.167 line:-1 position:50%
and help them do it
even faster.


39
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,869 line:-1
And next, every action
that you expose


40
00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.040 line:-1 position:50%
should be repeatable and of
persistent interest to the user.


41
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.108 line:-1 position:50%
That means it should
be something


42
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,978 line:-1
that the user
might want to do multiple times.


43
00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:52.646 line:-1 position:50%
It's not a good idea
to expose an action


44
00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:54.815 line:-1 position:50%
for something that someone
might only want to do


45
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,750 line:-1
once or twice.


46
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,252 line:-1
And you should also
only expose actions


47
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,789 line:-1
that are stateless
and executable at any time,


48
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,524 line:-1
because you can't
rely on someone


49
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,159 line:-1
being in a particular state


50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,796 line:-1
before your action
will be ready for use.


51
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,332 line:0
To learn more about
what makes a great action,


52
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,634 line:0
be sure to check out
the session called,


53
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,770 position:50%
"Design great actions
for Shortcuts,


54
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,509 position:50%
Siri, and Suggestions"
from WWDC 2021.


55
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,812 line:-1
So once you've decided
what actions to expose,


56
00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:29.416 line:-1 position:50%
you're ready to check out
the Shortcuts APIs.


57
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,418 line:-1
There are two APIS
that you can use


58
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,286 line:-1
to adopt shortcuts for your app.


59
00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:36.189 line:-1 position:50%
The first is NSUserActivity.


60
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,458 line:-1
NSUserActivity
is a lightweight way


61
00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.360 line:-1 position:50%
to represent
the state of your app,


62
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,496 line:-1
and it integrates with
other Apple features


63
00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:44.931 line:-1 position:50%
like Spotlight and Handoff.


64
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,534 line:-1
And the second is intents.


65
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,370 line:-1
Intents are a way
of representing, in detail,


66
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.140 line:-1 position:50%
a type of action that your app
can perform,


67
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.043 line:-1 position:50%
and Siri includes a bunch
of great built-in intents


68
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,677 line:-1
that support
a range of capabilities


69
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,414 line:-1
that you can use
to integrate with the system.


70
00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:03.550 line:-1 position:50%
Intents also supports
the ability for you to define


71
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.154 line:-1 position:50%
your own custom intents
for use with Shortcuts.


72
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,423 line:0
To learn more about both APIs


73
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,591 line:0
and how to adopt shortcuts
for your app,


74
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,461 line:0
be sure to watch the
"Introduction to Siri Shortcuts"


75
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:18,532 position:50%
session at WWDC 2018.


76
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,568 line:-1
For this session,
I'll be focusing on Intents,


77
00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:24.671 line:-1 position:50%
going over new and existing
opportunities for you


78
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,742 line:-1
to offer your app's capabilities
throughout the system.


79
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,445 line:-1
The first step toward
making an intent donation


80
00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:35.182 line:-1 position:50%
is to decide what type
of intent you'd like to adopt.


81
00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:37.918 line:-1 position:50%
Siri includes many great
built-in intents,


82
00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:44.424 line:-1 position:50%
like for messaging,
reservations, media, and more.


83
00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:47.360 line:-1 position:50%
There is also the ability
to define custom intents


84
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.130 line:-1 position:50%
in Xcode for Shortcuts.


85
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,499 line:-1
So if the action that you want
to build corresponds


86
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,802 line:-1
to one of the default
built-in SiriKit intents,


87
00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:57.637 line:-1 position:50%
then you should adopt that.


88
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,773 line:-1
But, otherwise,
you can define your own


89
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:04,744 line:-1
using an intent
definition file in Xcode.


90
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,647 line:-1
Once you've decided which
intent you'd like to adopt


91
00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:09.516 line:-1 position:50%
and defined it in your app,


92
00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:12.419 line:-1 position:50%
you can start
making intent donations.


93
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.388 line:-1 position:50%
An intent donation
is the act of telling the system


94
00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:18.758 line:-1 position:50%
when a person performs
an action in your app.


95
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,660 line:-1
The system will store
these donations


96
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.396 line:-1 position:50%
and use them to expand
your app's capabilities


97
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,533 line:-1
and presence
throughout the system.


98
00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.369 line:-1 position:50%
Apps that donate intents
show up in places


99
00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:33.507 line:-1 position:50%
throughout the system
like Suggestions, Shortcuts,


100
00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:37.244 line:-1 position:50%
Focus, Smart Stack,
and Siri.


101
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,346 line:-1
Now that you understand
at a high level


102
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:43,016 line:-1
what an intent donation is,
let's make this more concrete


103
00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:45.585 line:-1 position:50%
by going through the life
of an intent donation


104
00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.687 line:-1 position:50%
using an example.


105
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,756 line:-1
Let's use the example
of checking the weather


106
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,591 line:-1
in the Weather app.


107
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,895 line:-1
For this app, checking the
weather at a particular location


108
00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:57.264 line:-1 position:50%
is the key capability of the app


109
00:04:57.264 --> 00:05:00.133 line:-1 position:50%
that I'd like to expose
an action for.


110
00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.602 line:-1 position:50%
This app already
has an existing widget


111
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,172 line:-1
that I'd like to make
configurable using my intent,


112
00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:07.007 line:-1 position:50%
so someone can select the city


113
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:10,243 line:-1
they'd like to see
the weather for in the widget.


114
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,813 line:-1
Let's go ahead and learn how to
define a check weather intent,


115
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,682 line:-1
how to donate it to the system,


116
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,686 line:-1
and how the system
uses the donation.


117
00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:22.822 line:-1 position:50%
The first step to defining
an intent in Xcode


118
00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.358 line:-1 position:50%
is to create
an intent definition file.


119
00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:28.328 line:-1 position:50%
To do this,
I'll add a new file...


120
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:39,940 line:-1
...and select the SiriKit
Intent Definition File.


121
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.741 line:-1 position:50%
Then I'll select any targets


122
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,044 line:-1
that I want to use
the custom intent in,


123
00:05:44.044 --> 00:05:46.046 line:-1 position:50%
and confirm that
I'd like to create


124
00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:49.316 line:-1 position:50%
the intent definition file.


125
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,585 position:50%
Once the intent
definition file is created,


126
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:55,689 position:50%
I can define the intent.


127
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,924 position:50%
There wasn't an existing
built-in system intent


128
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,392 position:50%
to check the weather,


129
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:03,230 line:0
so I can go ahead
and add a new intent.


130
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.765 line:-1 position:50%
I'll call the intent
"Check Weather."


131
00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.372 line:-1 position:50%
From here, I can begin
defining the intent.


132
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.440 line:-1 position:50%
I'll start by checking


133
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,276 line:-1
the "Intent is eligible
for widgets" option


134
00:06:16.276 --> 00:06:18.011 line:-1 position:50%
because I'd like
to allow this intent


135
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,848 line:-1
to work as a configuration
for my app's existing widget.


136
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,651 line:-1
The system will also be able
to use my intent donations


137
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:29,889 line:-1
to power Smart Stack
widget intelligence.


138
00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.059 line:-1 position:50%
If you want your intent to also
support the Shortcuts app,


139
00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.495 line:-1 position:50%
check the "Intent is
user-configurable


140
00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:38.398 line:-1 position:50%
in the Shortcuts app
and Add to Siri" option.


141
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,533 line:-1
I'll uncheck this option
for this demo


142
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,770 line:-1
and just focus on
widgets and Suggestions.


143
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.704 line:-1 position:50%
I'll also leave the


144
00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:48.041 line:-1 position:50%
"Intent is eligible for Siri
Suggestions" option checked


145
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,677 line:-1
because I'd like the system
to use my donations


146
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,913 line:-1
to surface Siri Suggestions
for my intent.


147
00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:57.684 line:-1 position:50%
Next I need to define
the parameters of my intent.


148
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,686 line:-1
I can define just one parameter


149
00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:06.559 line:-1 position:50%
for the location
to check the weather in.


150
00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:09.562 line:-1 position:50%
Next I need to select
the parameter's type.


151
00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:11.865 line:-1 position:50%
This location represents
an object in my app


152
00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:15.435 line:-1 position:50%
corresponding to the city
the app has the weather for,


153
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.770 line:-1 position:50%
so I'm going to use
a custom type


154
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,573 line:-1
to represent this parameter.


155
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,076 line:0
I can go ahead and create
a custom type for a city


156
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,446 line:0
that has an identifier
and displayString.


157
00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:30.550 line:-1 position:50%
Let's go back
to our location parameter.


158
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,419 line:-1
You can see that
the type of the location


159
00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.155 line:-1 position:50%
is the new custom City type.


160
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,123 line:-1
I'll keep the option
for allowing users


161
00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.893 line:-1 position:50%
to edit the value in widgets,
because I'd like this intent


162
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:44,197 line:-1
to be used for widget
configuration.


163
00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:48.034 line:-1 position:50%
Since this intent won't support
running in Siri for this demo,


164
00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:52.806 line:-1 position:50%
I'll uncheck the "Siri can ask
for value when run" option.


165
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,607 line:-1
When people configure
the widget,


166
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,176 line:-1
the list of weather locations


167
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:59,045 line:-1
will need to be provided
by the app and will change


168
00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:01.748 line:-1 position:50%
depending on which cities
that person has saved


169
00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:06.052 line:-1 position:50%
so I will check the "Options are
provided dynamically" checkbox.


170
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,454 line:-1
Finally, I just need to define


171
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:11,124 line:-1
the supported parameter
combinations for Suggestions.


172
00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:13.426 line:-1 position:50%
The system reads
the intent definition file


173
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,363 line:-1
to determine the intent
and parameter combinations


174
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,832 line:-1
that an app supports
for prediction.


175
00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:21.868 line:-1 position:50%
In this case,
the app supports an intent


176
00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:24.437 line:-1 position:50%
with a location parameter set.


177
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,272 position:50%
I'll go ahead
and add that parameter


178
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:33,913 position:50%
as a supported combination.


179
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:41,588 position:50%
Then I'll define the summary
that is shown in Suggestions.


180
00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:42.522 line:-1 position:50%
And that's it.


181
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,225 line:-1
I've defined the custom intent
to check the weather


182
00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:48.728 line:-1 position:50%
that can be used
by widgets and Suggestions.


183
00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:51.364 line:-1 position:50%
With the intent defined,
I just need to donate the intent


184
00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.767 line:-1 position:50%
to the system whenever someone
checks the weather


185
00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:56.636 line:-1 position:50%
for a specific location
in the app.


186
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,739 line:-1
To donate the intent,
I create an instance


187
00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:03.476 line:-1 position:50%
of the intent class
and set its parameter values.


188
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,479 line:-1
After creating the intent,
I create an instance


189
00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:10.049 line:-1 position:50%
of an INInteraction object,
passing in the intent,


190
00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.585 line:-1 position:50%
then call the interaction
object's donate method


191
00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:15.588 line:-1 position:50%
to donate the intent
to the system.


192
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,092 line:-1
Behind the scenes, the system
stores these donations over time


193
00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:21.461 line:-1 position:50%
along with the context
the person was in


194
00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:23.563 line:-1 position:50%
when the intent was donated.


195
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,666 line:-1
As they continue to check
the weather in the Weather app,


196
00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:29.903 line:-1 position:50%
the app continues
to make intent donations.


197
00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.971 line:-1 position:50%
In this case, they have been
checking the weather


198
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:35,842 line:-1
in Cupertino and in San Diego.


199
00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:38.611 line:-1 position:50%
The system uses the intent
parameters to determine


200
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:41.281 line:-1 position:50%
whether the intents
are equivalent or not.


201
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:43.583 line:-1 position:50%
As shown by the color
of the donations,


202
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,085 line:-1
the two Cupertino donations
are equivalent


203
00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:49.422 line:-1 position:50%
and are different from
the two San Diego donations.


204
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,358 line:-1
In practice, the system
also receives donations


205
00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:55.361 line:-1 position:50%
from many other apps
on the person's device.


206
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,465 line:-1
If at any time
you'd like to delete donations,


207
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:02,068 line:-1
you can delete a single donation
or a group of donations


208
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,437 line:-1
using our deletion APIs.


209
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,105 line:-1
If someone has,
for example,


210
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,641 line:-1
removed the San Diego
weather location


211
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:10.810 line:-1 position:50%
from their stored
weather locations,


212
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.212 line:-1 position:50%
then you can delete intents


213
00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:14.781 line:-1 position:50%
associated with
the San Diego location.


214
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.950 line:-1 position:50%
It's important
to delete donations


215
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,919 line:-1
so people don't get suggestions
for actions in your app


216
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,922 line:-1
that are no longer relevant.


217
00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:24.424 line:-1 position:50%
When donating the intent,


218
00:10:24.424 --> 00:10:28.328 line:-1 position:50%
the INInteraction identifier
and group identifier


219
00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:31.731 line:-1 position:50%
can be used to later delete
one or more INInteractions


220
00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.233 line:-1 position:50%
that you've donated.


221
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,735 line:-1
You can either pass in
an array of identifiers


222
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,004 line:-1
to delete individual
interactions,


223
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,406 line:-1
or you can pass in
the group identifier


224
00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.809 line:-1 position:50%
to delete a group
of interactions.


225
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,513 line:-1
So how are all of these intent
donations used by the system?


226
00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:49.182 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a high level view
of the donation history


227
00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:52.018 line:-1 position:50%
the system sees
across multiple days.


228
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,088 line:0
Here you can see three days
of donations for a person


229
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,390 position:50%
and the donations that occurred
throughout the day,


230
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,659 line:0
starting with when they woke up.


231
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:03.129 line:-1 position:50%
The system uses machine learning
and on-device intelligence


232
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,764 line:-1
to find patterns in the data


233
00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:07.100 line:-1 position:50%
and predict what intent
is relevant


234
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,738 line:-1
given a person's current context
and past behavioral patterns.


235
00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:14.474 line:-1 position:50%
In this case, you can see that
this person has a pattern


236
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:18,945 line:-1
associated with checking
the weather after they wake up.


237
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,747 position:50%
The on-device intelligence
integrates with


238
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:24,551 position:50%
user-facing features to expose
your app's capabilities


239
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,020 line:0
and presence to the user.


240
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,291 line:0
Let's look at some examples of
where this exposure takes place.


241
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,126 line:-1
Before we do that,
it's worth noting


242
00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:35.562 line:-1 position:50%
that all of the machine learning
and intelligence


243
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:39,732 line:-1
is performed on-device
in a privacy-preserving manner,


244
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,868 line:-1
meaning Apple does not
collect any data


245
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:45,204 line:-1
that can be used
to personally identify a user.


246
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:49,709 line:-1
With that said, let's return
to our weather example.


247
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.544 line:-1 position:50%
I can use the intent I defined


248
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,948 line:-1
to make the app's
existing widget configurable.


249
00:11:54.948 --> 00:11:57.717 line:-1 position:50%
After configuring the widget
to use the intent,


250
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,086 line:-1
people will be able
to select the location


251
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,022 line:-1
they'd like to see
the weather for in the widget.


252
00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:05.124 line:-1 position:50%
With the app donating intents


253
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,727 line:-1
that match the widget's
configuration intent,


254
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.929 line:-1 position:50%
the system is now
able to provide people


255
00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:13.600 line:-1 position:50%
with Smart Stack widget
intelligence for the app.


256
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.569 line:-1 position:50%
Let's say there is a person who
has a Home screen configuration


257
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,438 line:-1
with a Smart Stack.


258
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:23,209 line:0
New in iOS 15, the Smart Stack
supports Widget Suggestions,


259
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,678 position:50%
which allow the system
to suggest widgets


260
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,580 position:50%
the user doesn't have
in their stack


261
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,051 line:0
by placing them on top of the
stack at just the right time.


262
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,088 line:0
To determine whether a widget
should be suggested


263
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,724 position:50%
and the correct time
to make the suggestion,


264
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,193 position:50%
the system leverages
the intent donations


265
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:43,029 line:0
that match your widget
configuration intent.


266
00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:46.232 line:-1 position:50%
In the weather example,
after the person woke up,


267
00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:48.534 line:-1 position:50%
the Smart Stack placed
the Weather widget


268
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,671 line:-1
on the top of the stack
at just the right time.


269
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:54.240 line:-1 position:50%
This is a great way for people
to discover your widget


270
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.844 line:-1 position:50%
and to deliver glanceable
information.


271
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,279 line:-1
If they already had the Weather
widget in their stack,


272
00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.916 line:-1 position:50%
then it would have rotated
to the Weather widget instead.


273
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,152 line:0
To learn more about
how to add configuration


274
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,221 position:50%
and intelligence
to your widgets,


275
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:13,159 position:50%
watch the WWDC session
from 2020.


276
00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:16.829 line:-1 position:50%
Your intent donations also
power the on-device intelligence


277
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,933 line:-1
behind Siri Suggestions
that are shown in Lock screen,


278
00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:23.036 line:-1 position:50%
in Spotlight search,


279
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:27,573 line:-1
and in the Siri Suggestions
widget.


280
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,208 line:-1
These suggestions allow people


281
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,312 line:-1
to perform the key capabilities
of your app with one tap.


282
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,315 line:-1
Your intents can also be used
in the built-in Shortcuts app


283
00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:40.253 line:-1 position:50%
as a part of a simple or complex
multi-step shortcut


284
00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:46.025 line:-1 position:50%
across macOS, iOS,
and watchOS.


285
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,828 line:-1
And donations are also used
to determine what actions


286
00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:53.700 line:-1 position:50%
get suggested to people
in the Shortcuts App Gallery.


287
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.835 line:-1 position:50%
People can also set up
a voice shortcut


288
00:13:55.835 --> 00:14:00.273 line:-1 position:50%
to execute your custom intents
just by asking Siri.


289
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,443 line:-1
If you chose to use the
built-in INSendMessageIntent,


290
00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:06.546 line:-1 position:50%
your intent donations are used
by sharing suggestions


291
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,047 line:-1
to make it really easy for users


292
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:12,785 line:-1
to get content to the people and
groups that matter most to them.


293
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:16,355 line:-1
New in iOS 15, when you donate
INSendMessageIntents,


294
00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:19.125 line:-1 position:50%
the system uses
the people in your donations


295
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,561 line:-1
to determine who is
strongly associated


296
00:14:21.561 --> 00:14:24.263 line:-1 position:50%
with the user's current Focus.


297
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,567 line:-1
These strong associations
can be used to make suggestions


298
00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:31.037 line:-1 position:50%
to add certain people to their
allowed notifications list


299
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,172 line:-1
when they receive messages
from them.


300
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,008 line:-1
In this case, you can see
that Aga is suggested


301
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,778 line:-1
as a person who this user
should consider adding


302
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,881 line:-1
to their allowed notifications
list for Work Focus


303
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:46.085 line:-1 position:50%
based on that person's
past interactions with Aga.


304
00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:47.487 line:-1 position:50%
If you choose
to use the built-in


305
00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:50.189 line:-1 position:50%
INGetReservationDetailsIntent,


306
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:52.859 line:-1 position:50%
your intent donations
will be used to notify users


307
00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:55.495 line:-1 position:50%
when it's time to leave
for their restaurant reservation


308
00:14:55.495 --> 00:14:58.097 line:-1 position:50%
based on current
traffic conditions


309
00:14:58.097 --> 00:15:01.667 line:-1 position:50%
and when it's time
to check in for their flight.


310
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,569 position:50%
People will also see
Siri Suggestions


311
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,405 line:0
when they open Maps,
which makes it super convenient

to use the built-in


314
00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:16.582 line:-1 position:50%
INPlayMediaIntent,
your intent donations


315
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,620 line:-1
will be shown in the new
Now Playing UI in Lock screen,


316
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,357 line:-1
Control Center,
and in the Home app.


317
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:27,293 line:-1
This is a fantastic way
for users to start listening to


318
00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:32.398 line:-1 position:50%
or watching their favorite
content from your app.


319
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:36,169 line:-1
People may consume periodical
media content like podcasts,


320
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,938 line:-1
TV shows, or movies in your app.


321
00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:42.775 line:-1 position:50%
In these cases, you can use
the INUpcomingMediaManager API


322
00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.311 line:-1 position:50%
to provide the system
a list of media intents


323
00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:48.281 line:-1 position:50%
for content that the user
hasn't listened to or watched,


324
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.216 line:-1 position:50%
so might be interested in.


325
00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:52.885 line:-1 position:50%
The system combines
the past media donations


326
00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.654 line:-1 position:50%
with your app's upcoming media


327
00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:57.523 line:-1 position:50%
to make better
media suggestions.


328
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,426 line:-1
Your intents can also be
surfaced on the Siri Watch Face


329
00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:04.297 line:-1 position:50%
using the
INRelevantShortcut API.


330
00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:07.366 line:-1 position:50%
The INRelevantShortcut API
enables you to expose


331
00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:09.435 line:-1 position:50%
relevance information
to the system


332
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,337 line:-1
such as a time or a location


333
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,574 line:-1
for when your shortcut should be
shown on the watch face.


334
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,843 position:50%
To learn more about
how to expose your shortcuts


335

WWDC session from 2018.


338
00:16:24.684 --> 00:16:27.987 line:-1 position:50%
New in iOS 15,
the widgetKind property


339
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.356 line:-1 position:50%
was added to the
INRelevantShortcut object


340
00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:32.491 line:-1 position:50%
so you can hint to the system
when to show


341
00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:35.461 line:-1 position:50%
the corresponding widget
in a Smart Stack.


342
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,997 line:0
To learn more about this
property and how to use it,


343
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,766 position:50%
watch the "Add intelligence
to your widgets" session


344
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,970 position:50%
from WWDC 2021.


345
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,504 position:50%
To summarize,
we've taken a look


346
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,908 position:50%
at the life of intent donations
and seen how they are used


347
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,911 line:0
to expand your app's presence
and capabilities


348
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,579 line:0
throughout the system


349
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,582 line:0
to an increasing number of
places like the Smart Stack,


350
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:01,888 position:50%
Focus, Suggestions,
Shortcuts, and Siri.


351
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,624 line:-1
Now that we've looked at
the life of an intent donation,


352
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,259 line:-1
let's talk in more detail about


353
00:17:06.259 --> 00:17:08.995 line:-1 position:50%
how you can structure
your donations for success


354
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:13,299 line:-1
and ultimately expand your app's
presence across the system.


355
00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:17.837 line:-1 position:50%
Let's use a new example of
ordering coffee in a coffee app.


356
00:17:17.837 --> 00:17:20.273 line:-1 position:50%
So far I've defined
an order coffee intent


357
00:17:20.273 --> 00:17:22.141 line:-1 position:50%
and exposed two parameters:


358
00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:25.745 line:-1 position:50%
the size of the coffee
and the coffee item.


359
00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:29.181 line:-1 position:50%
In this case,
we have a large iced latte.


360
00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:30.850 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a look
at what could go wrong


361
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.453 line:-1 position:50%
if I include the order date
in my intent donation.


362
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,456 line:0
It starts off OK,
with a donation coming in


363
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:41,694 position:50%
for a large iced latte
on June 7, 2021.


364
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,195 line:-1
But once the date changes,


365
00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:45.564 line:-1 position:50%
the intent's date parameter
has a new value,


366
00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.633 line:-1 position:50%
and the system
treats the second donation


367
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,669 line:-1
as a completely different
intent,


368
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,539 line:-1
despite both donations having
the same item and size.


369
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,875 line:-1
The system continues
to treat the donations


370
00:17:55.875 --> 00:17:57.743 line:-1 position:50%
differently over time
and you can see


371
00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.979 line:-1 position:50%
that they're not equivalent
across the days,


372
00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:02.581 line:-1 position:50%
based on the donation's colors.


373
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:05.484 line:-1 position:50%
If you look at a high-level view
of the donation history


374
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,820 line:-1
the system sees
across multiple days,


375
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,388 line:-1
you can see that there's
no meaningful pattern


376
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:13,392 line:-1
the system can find for
ordering a large iced latte.


377
00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:14.860 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a look
at how I filled out


378
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,432 line:-1
the intent definition file to
understand what went wrong.


379
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:24,904 line:-1
I defined the three parameters
for item, size, and date.


380
00:18:24.904 --> 00:18:27.707 line:-1 position:50%
And I added a supported
parameter combination


381
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,775 line:-1
with all three parameters.


382
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,778 line:-1
This tells the system that it
should use all three parameters


383
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,613 line:-1
to determine
how to find patterns


384
00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:37.516 line:-1 position:50%
across intent donations
for prediction.


385
00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:40.753 line:-1 position:50%
In this case, including the date
in the supported combination


386
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,588 line:-1
with the item and size


387
00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:45.524 line:-1 position:50%
prevented the system
from properly finding a pattern


388
00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:47.493 line:-1 position:50%
across the donations.


389
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,928 line:-1
To resolve this issue,


390
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:52,264 line:0
I can instead define a supported
combination that includes


391
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,568 line:0
only the size and item
parameters.


392
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,604 position:50%
By doing this, the system knows
that it should only use


393
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,608 position:50%
the item and size parameters
when comparing intent donations


394
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,177 line:0
to find patterns over time.


395
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,948 line:-1
Now, the system will see a
donation for a large iced latte,


396
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,083 line:-1
not including the date anymore.


397
00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:13.085 line:-1 position:50%
Then on the second day,


398
00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:15.087 line:-1 position:50%
the system sees
an equivalent donation


399
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,889 line:-1
for a large iced latte.


400
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,625 line:-1
And same on the third day.


401
00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:22.661 line:-1 position:50%
If you look at a high-level view
of the donation history again,


402
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,963 line:-1
you can see that
there is now a pattern


403
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,532 line:-1
associated with ordering
a large iced latte


404
00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:29.301 line:-1 position:50%
just after waking up.


405
00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:32.271 line:-1 position:50%
To maximize the benefit
of your donations,


406
00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:34.140 line:-1 position:50%
please ensure
your intent donations


407
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,574 line:-1
are likely to be repeated


408
00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:37.209 line:-1 position:50%
and the intent payload
you're donating


409
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,745 line:-1
is consistent across donations.


410
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,615 line:-1
That means
don't include timestamps.


411
00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:45.985 line:-1 position:50%
In summary, the system has
become increasingly integrated


412
00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.120 line:-1 position:50%
with the apps we use
day to day


413
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,424 line:-1
and intent donations
are a key integration point.


414
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:54,026 line:-1
Benefit from donating intents
by expanding your app's


415
00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:57.696 line:-1 position:50%
capabilities and presence
across the system.


416
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,664 line:-1
Thank you for listening


417
00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:02.735 line:-1 position:50%
and I hope you have
a great rest of your WWDC 2021.
