[Doug]
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


5
00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:12.946 line:-1
My name is Doug,


6
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.715 line:-2
and today my colleague
Nate and I will take a look


7
00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:17.484 line:-2
at how Universal Scene
Description, or USD,


8
00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:20.287 line:-2
can be used for a wide variety
of 3D work flows.


9
00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.624 line:-2
We'll talk a little bit
about what USD is,


10
00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.058 line:-2
take a look
at the exciting developments


11
00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:26.793 line:-1
n the world of USD,


12
00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:29.596 line:-2
show some incredible
new features in Preview,


13
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.598 line:-2
and demonstrate
how USD can be at the center


14
00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:33.567 line:-1
of a creative 3D workflow.


15
00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.870 line:-2
USD is a set of libraries
and file formats


16
00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:39.506 line:-2
that allows for assembly,
interchange, and organization


17
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.607 line:-1
of any number of assets


18
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.644 line:-2
into scenes, shots,
or virtual objects.


19
00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:45.546 line:-2
From object capture,
asset creation,


20
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.947 line:-1
layout and editing


21
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.683 line:-2
to rendering quick thumbnails
for sharing or feedback


22
00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.720 line:-2
to creating USDZ assets for use
in Augmented Reality, or AR.


23
00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:56.190 line:-2
The flexibility of USD
can be a core component


24
00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.892 line:-2
of an extensible,
collaborative, 3D pipeline.


25
00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.461 line:-1
USD is a foundational technology


26
00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.463 line:-2
that, with the growing
and deepening integration


27
00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.832 line:-2
into Digital Content
Creation tools,


28
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.267 line:-1
is enabling more and more ways


29
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:09.970 line:-1
of creating assets and content.


30
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.841 line:-2
Render, collaborate,
for games, AR, film


31
00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:15.876 line:-1
all with USD at the center.


32
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.179 line:-2
USD was developed by Pixar to
enable them to create


33
00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:21.381 line:-2
the enormously complex movies
we love.


34
00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.550 line:-2
We at Apple worked with Pixar
a few years ago


35
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:25.485 line:-1
to develop the USDZ format


36
00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.554 line:-1
to utilize USD in a single file


37
00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:30.991 line:-2
to deliver rich AR content
directly to your devices.


38
00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:33.260 line:-2
USD-based workflows
are highly collaborative,


39
00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.728 line:-2
enabling you
to work independently


40
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.863 line:-1
on parts of an asset,


41
00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:38.565 line:-2
easily incorporating
your changes with others.


42
00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.434 line:-2
It's inherently
extensible by design


43
00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:43.303 line:-2
and is rapidly emerging
as a key workflow technology.


44
00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:44.671 line:-2
It's built on
decades and decades


45
00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.540 line:-2
of production experience
in the film industry


46
00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.041 line:-2
and is increasingly
being adopted


47
00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:52.346 line:-2
for games, simulation, AR,
manufacturing, and e-commerce.


48
00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.248 line:-2
Pixar is using an open
and collaborative model


49
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:56.283 line:-2
that the USD project
has been following.


50
00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.886 line:-2
The USD forum is active
and full of core contributors


51
00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:59.887 line:-1
answering queries,


52
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.255 line:-2
and the Academy Software
Foundation


53
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:03.223 line:-2
has a working group
that meets regularly


54
00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:05.025 line:-2
to gather input
from interested groups.


55
00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.760 line:-1
Let's take a high level look


56
00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.829 line:-2
at other formats
out there today.


57
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.398 line:-1
The most basic format is .obj,


58
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.701 line:-2
which often essentially
contains just a single 3D model.


59
00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.436 line:-2
It has limited support
for materials


60
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.039 line:-1
and no support for animations.


61
00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.808 line:-2
Then there's a large group
of more modern file formats.


62
00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:23.377 line:-2
These usually support
multiple models


63
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.878 line:-2
that can be laid out
in a scene graph


64
00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:26.313 line:-2
and have varying levels
of support


65
00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.248 line:-1
for material and definitions.


66
00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:31.018 line:-2
Many are tied
to proprietary tools.


67
00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:33.654 line:-1
USD supports all of this


68
00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:36.390 line:-2
and is additionally designed
to be highly scalable.


69
00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:38.525 line:-2
Pixar developed USD
for its use in films,


70
00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.361 line:-2
so representing millions
of objects is the typical case.


71
00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:42.229 line:-1
And USD is built


72
00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:44.398 line:-2
with collaboration
as a core feature,


73
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.633 line:-2
allowing for many artists
to work on a single scene


74
00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:49.269 line:-2
without getting
in each other's way.


75
00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:51.672 line:-2
USDZ is the archive package
for USD


76
00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:53.540 line:-2
and inherits
most of these features,


77
00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.776 line:-2
is optimized for sharing,
and allows a single file


78
00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:59.479 line:-2
to contain all the resources
needed for rich AR interchange.


79
00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:04.351 line:-2
USD naturally allows creation
of USDZ files for AR content.


80
00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.553 line:-2
But it's also the front-end
for a full featured pipeline


81
00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:09.256 line:-2
that delivers USDZ
for AR and e-commerce


82
00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.158 line:-2
and assets
for offline rendering.


83
00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.093 line:-2
Last year,
we released RealityConverter,


84
00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:15.662 line:-2
a stand-alone utility
to allow easy creation


85
00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:19.333 line:-2
of a self-contained USDZ
from collections of USD files,


86
00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.801 line:-1
.obj, alembic,


87
00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:23.370 line:-2
and a wide variety
of other 3D formats as well.


88
00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:25.672 line:-2
On the Apple Developer site,
there are command line tools


89
00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:28.775 line:-2
to allow you to automate
processing of batches of assets.


90
00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.477 line:-1
As the delivery format for AR,


91
00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:33.680 line:-2
USDZs can be authored to target
a specific Apple device,


92
00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:34.982 line:-2
letting you tailor
the experience


93
00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:35.949 line:-1
for your audience.


94
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.553 line:-2
The USD ecosystem
is growing rapidly.


95
00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.488 line:-2
It's really exciting to see
the things growing


96
00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:43.857 line:-2
from the roots
of what USD provides.


97
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:45.058 line:-1
Multiverse from J-Cube


98
00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:47.327 line:-2
brings the full power
of non-destructive USD editing


99
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:49.329 line:-2
to the Mac,
enabling insanely fast


100
00:03:49.363 --> 00:03:51.632 line:-2
multi-DCC workflows
as well as editing


101
00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:54.168 line:-2
in the Multiverse
USD Standalone Editor,


102
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:57.471 line:-2
all powered by
the Metal Hydra Storm renderer.


103
00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:00.974 line:-2
OTOY's Octane renderer
can plug into DCC's like Houdini


104
00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:03.277 line:-2
and harnesses the blazing-fast
power of the GPU


105
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.814 line:-2
to render spectrally correct
images directly from USD files.


106
00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:10.083 line:-2
ZBrush works directly
with USD mesh data


107
00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:13.720 line:-2
to bring all the power
of sculpting to a USD workflow.


108
00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:16.857 line:-2
And Maya continues to integrate
USD deeper and deeper,


109
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.228 line:-2
now using USD Hydra rendering
directly in the VP2 viewport.


110
00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:24.031 line:-1
Maya 2022 is the first version


111
00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:27.267 line:-2
to have native seamless
integration of USD.


112
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:30.137 line:-2
This means you can load
gigabytes of USD data in seconds


113
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.273 line:-2
and work directly with that data
using Maya's native tools.


114
00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:36.009 line:-2
USD data is integrated
right into the Attribute Editor


115
00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:37.244 line:-1
and the Outliner.


116
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:40.347 line:-2
It brings all the USD benefits
right inside the DCC:


117
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.882 line:-2
nondestructive editing,
variants,


118
00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:43.984 line:-1
and collaboration to name a few.


119
00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.086 line:-2
Apple worked with Autodesk
to improve the USD


120
00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.422 line:-2
importing and exporting
functionality as well,


121
00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.823 line:-1
including Blendshape support


122
00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:52.626 line:-2
and using textures
directly in USDZ files.


123
00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.495 line:-2
Of course,
USD isn't a static technology.


124
00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:56.930 line:-2
Apple is collaborating
with Pixar


125
00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:58.165 line:-2
and the rest
of the USD community


126
00:04:58.198 --> 00:04:59.933 line:-2
to extend and improve
USD's support


127
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:02.903 line:-2
for the latest features
in 3D content creation.


128
00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.005 line:-2
Last year Apple, Nvidia,
and Pixar


129
00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:07.241 line:-2
jointly developed a schema
to represent properties


130
00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:09.409 line:-1
needed for Physics simulation.


131
00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:11.778 line:-2
It can represent properties
from real-time AR physics


132
00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:13.280 line:-2
all the way
to offline simulations


133
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.882 line:-1
for robotics and film.


134
00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.451 line:-2
It's exciting to see
such widespread support


135
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.320 line:-2
and so many great updates
to the USD ecosystem.


136
00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:23.357 line:-2
Another key feature
of USD is Hydra.


137
00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:27.628 line:-2
Hydra is USD's high-performance,
modern rendering architecture


138
00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.563 line:-2
designed specifically
to get millions of objects


139
00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.732 line:-2
to your screen
as fast as possible.


140
00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:33.901 line:-1
Hydra Storm is one such renderer


141
00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:37.237 line:-2
that is part of the core
USD open-source distribution.


142
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:39.039 line:-2
We're thrilled to share
that Preview and Quick Look


143
00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:40.374 line:-1
in macOS will include


144
00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:43.644 line:-2
a Metal-accelerated
Hydra Storm renderer.


145
00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.779 line:-2
This allows anyone
to quickly view USD files


146
00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.447 line:-2
in a way that's consistent
with Hydra Storm


147
00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:48.949 line:-1
on other platforms


148
00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.285 line:-2
all without
having to open a DCC.


149
00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:53.587 line:-2
It can handle complex
production-grade assets


150
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.723 line:-2
and has some 3D scene
exploration tools built in.


151
00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:00.260 line:-2
Here's a layout asset
from Pixar's "Toy Story 4,"


152
00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:01.228 line:-1
the antiques mall


153
00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:03.063 line:-2
rendering in real-time
in Preview.


154
00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:05.566 line:-2
It has tens of thousands
of individual objects


155
00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.334 line:-1
and about 34 million triangles.


156
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.037 line:-2
It's a great example
of a production-quality asset,


157
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.472 line:-2
and it's a real challenge
not only for the renderer


158
00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:15.442 line:-2
but for also
any scene navigation tools.


159
00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:21.982 line:-1
To help move around the scene,


160
00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:23.717 line:-1
any cameras in the USD file


161
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.886 line:-2
are shown in the thumbnail views
to the left,


162
00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.955 line:-1
letting me click through them.


163
00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:29.556 line:-2
As well as
the normal camera controls,


164
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.958 line:-2
I can click on objects
in the view


165
00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:32.759 line:-1
and lock the camera to them.


166
00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:35.629 line:-2
To get a more detailed picture
of the composition of the scene,


167
00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:37.030 line:-1
we added an outliner


168
00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:38.832 line:-2
that displays
all of the object nodes.


169
00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.501 line:-2
If I select an object
in the view,


170
00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:42.002 line:-2
then it is highlighted
in the outliner.


171
00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:43.937 line:-2
But as you can see
from this huge list here,


172
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:45.305 line:-2
we needed to provide better
tools


173
00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.974 line:-2
to assist with scenes
of this complexity.


174
00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:49.810 line:-2
So we've also added the ability
to search for objects by name.


175
00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:52.412 line:-2
For example, if I search for
all the jukeboxes in the scene,


176
00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:55.482 line:-2
I'll get a list of them
and can focus on each in turn.


177
00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:00.521 line:-2
Once I've found
the one I'm interested in,


178
00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:03.590 line:-2
it can be saved
as a separate USD file.


179
00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:07.828 line:-2
And then I can view this again
in Preview and Quick Look


180
00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:11.064 line:-2
and use it in my AR scene
in Reality Composer.


181
00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:13.433 line:-2
On top of the features
I've just shown you,


182
00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:14.601 line:-1
Preview also enables you


183
00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:17.638 line:-2
to render animated USD scenes
to a movie file


184
00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:19.506 line:-2
or render the current view
to an image,


185
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.275 line:-1
complete with alpha channel.


186
00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.011 line:-2
For AR,
Preview uses the RealityKit


187
00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:26.647 line:-2
rendering engine
to view USDZ files.


188
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.416 line:-2
It's the same renderer
as AR Quick Look on iOS


189
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.450 line:-1
and is a great way to check


190
00:07:30.484 --> 00:07:32.719 line:-2
what an on-device view
will look like.


191
00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:34.855 line:-2
We've worked
with Pixar Animation Studios


192
00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:36.890 line:-2
to add Metal and M1
acceleration support


193
00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:38.392 line:-1
to their powerful GPU renderer


194
00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.327 line:-2
for producing 3D movies
like "Soul"


195
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.262 line:-1
and the upcoming movie "Luca."


196
00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:43.797 line:-2
Pixar Animation Studios
is making


197
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.466 line:-2
Metal-accelerated Hydra Storm
available for integration


198
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.802 line:-2
in your apps through
their USD Open Source project


199
00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:50.771 line:-1
by the end of 2021.


200
00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:53.974 line:-2
Now let's see
how all these exciting USD tools


201
00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:55.809 line:-2
can be used
in a single workflow.


202
00:07:55.843 --> 00:07:57.678 line:-1
So let's let Nate get to work.


203
00:07:58.679 --> 00:07:59.680 line:-1
[Nate]Thanks, Doug.


204
00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:01.381 line:-2
We're going to show you
how you can use USD


205
00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:04.484 line:-2
to capture a real-world object
and bring it into 3D.


206
00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:05.752 line:-1
We'll edit it along the way


207
00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:08.555 line:-2
and then render a gorgeous
photoreal product shot


208
00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:10.324 line:-1
all with USD.


209
00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:12.359 line:-1
In a traditional 3D workflow,


210
00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:15.929 line:-2
sharing data between DCCs
is cumbersome and error-prone.


211
00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:18.232 line:-2
Lengthy import and export
steps are required


212
00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:20.634 line:-2
to move data
from one tool to another.


213
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.103 line:-2
This traditional workflow
is also one-way.


214
00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:24.905 line:-2
As only the last stages
of the pipeline


215
00:08:24.938 --> 00:08:27.941 line:-2
can see the overall scene,
earlier stages lack context


216
00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:30.711 line:-2
on how their contributions
will be used.


217
00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:33.413 line:-2
In contrast, USD allows us
to work in parallel


218
00:08:33.447 --> 00:08:34.348 line:-1
using different tools


219
00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:36.617 line:-2
and to work natively
on the same data.


220
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.853 line:-2
Crucially, since all of our data
is represented as USD,


221
00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:41.788 line:-2
the import/export step
is eliminated


222
00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:43.590 line:-1
and sharing is automatic.


223
00:08:43.624 --> 00:08:46.260 line:-2
A USD workflow
enables faster iteration,


224
00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:47.227 line:-1
better collaboration,


225
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:50.464 line:-2
and opens up new
and more creative possibilities.


226
00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:51.632 line:-1
Since it's morning somewhere,


227
00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:53.600 line:-2
we can assume
that it's time for breakfast.


228
00:08:53.634 --> 00:08:55.802 line:-1
So let's make some pancakes.


229
00:08:55.836 --> 00:08:59.373 line:-2
Here's a sketch of how we'd like
our overall scene to look.


230
00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:02.643 line:-2
We've storyboarded
a few different concepts,


231
00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:04.411 line:-1
camera angles, and layouts,


232
00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:06.914 line:-2
and decided
this is our favorite.


233
00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:08.415 line:-1
Let's see how we can use USD


234
00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:10.751 line:-2
to turn this sketch
into reality.


235
00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:12.886 line:-1
Since we're using USD,


236
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.390 line:-2
we can arrange the scene
into several separate files.


237
00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:18.792 line:-2
Each file will contribute
to some aspect of the scene,


238
00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:20.194 line:-1
be it the layout of the models,


239
00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:21.495 line:-1
sculpting of the geometry,


240
00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:24.298 line:-2
or any animation or lighting
we might want to add.


241
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:27.734 line:-2
These files are all referenced,
or linked, into the main scene.


242
00:09:27.768 --> 00:09:29.670 line:-1
This is a core feature of USD


243
00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:31.705 line:-2
which allows any number
of people or tools


244
00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.408 line:-2
to collaborate on the same scene
at the same time.


245
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.643 line:-1
So first, let's set the table.


246
00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:39.813 line:-2
We're using Autodesk's Maya
to construct our overall scene.


247
00:09:39.847 --> 00:09:42.816 line:-2
We need a USD file
to store all of the layout data.


248
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.685 line:-2
This is where
we assemble all of our assets


249
00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:46.620 line:-1
and place them into the scene.


250
00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.256 line:-1
We also want a cool camera move,


251
00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:50.924 line:-2
so we add a USD file
to our scene


252
00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.559 line:-1
for the camera animation.


253
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.262 line:-2
To create the 3D model
of the pancakes,


254
00:09:55.295 --> 00:09:58.065 line:-2
we'll use Object Capture
on our real pancakes.


255
00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.399 line:-1
After we've captured the model,


256
00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:01.735 line:-2
we'll use Pixologic's ZBrush
to do some cleanup


257
00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.337 line:-1
and make some enhancements.


258
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.506 line:-2
Here we've added a sculpting
USD file to the scene


259
00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:07.574 line:-1
where this data will live.


260
00:10:07.608 --> 00:10:09.610 line:-2
Can't have pancakes
without syrup.


261
00:10:09.643 --> 00:10:12.312 line:-2
We make our virtual syrup
in SideFX Houdini,


262
00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:14.281 line:-2
using its fluid simulation
capabilities


263
00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:16.750 line:-1
and native support for USD.


264
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:19.553 line:-1
Finally, we'll also use Houdini


265
00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:21.755 line:-2
to add some virtual lights
to our scene.


266
00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:24.324 line:-2
Let's see
in a little more detail


267
00:10:24.358 --> 00:10:26.460 line:-1
how all of this comes together.


268
00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:30.163 line:-2
First, we use Object Capture
to create a 3D model


269
00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:32.766 line:-2
from our real,
physical pancakes.


270
00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.134 line:-1
Using a series of photographs


271
00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:35.569 line:-1
taken from different angles,


272
00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:37.070 line:-1
we can construct a 3D mesh


273
00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:39.173 line:-2
and surface material
of the pancakes.


274
00:10:41.175 --> 00:10:44.511 line:-2
Once we've acquired this model,
we can view it in Preview.


275
00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:46.180 line:-2
Here's a breakdown
of the captured model


276
00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:47.748 line:-1
with and without textures.


277
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:50.117 line:-2
We'll use this as the basis
of our sculpting USD


278
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.919 line:-1
that we'll edit later in ZBrush.


279
00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:55.189 line:-2
While we're capturing
the pancakes,


280
00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:58.025 line:-2
we can use Maya to construct
the initial set of USD files


281
00:10:58.058 --> 00:10:59.927 line:-1
where all of our data will live.


282
00:11:00.928 --> 00:11:02.663 line:-1
As of Maya 2022,


283
00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:04.598 line:-1
USD is natively supported,


284
00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:08.001 line:-2
and it's easy
to create a setup like this.


285
00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.237 line:-1
Once we've set up our files


286
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.939 line:-2
and linked in
our captured pancakes,


287
00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:13.373 line:-1
we can do the layout.


288
00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:14.942 line:-2
Here I've assembled
some of the props


289
00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:16.410 line:-1
that make up the scene.


290
00:11:16.443 --> 00:11:19.012 line:-2
I just need to make
a few more adjustments.


291
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.416 line:-2
This is the breakdown
of our scene


292
00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:24.084 line:-1
after we've done the layout.


293
00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:26.320 line:-2
While Object Capture
produces excellent results,


294
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:27.421 line:-1
we weren't able to capture


295
00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:28.856 line:-2
all of the angles
of our pancakes


296
00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:30.057 line:-1
before we ate them,


297
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.558 line:-1
so let's take them into ZBrush


298
00:11:31.592 --> 00:11:33.594 line:-1
for some digital enhancement.


299
00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:36.864 line:-1
Using ZBrush,


300
00:11:36.897 --> 00:11:38.532 line:-2
we can paint in
the missing geometry


301
00:11:38.565 --> 00:11:40.067 line:-2
at the bottom
of the stack of pancakes


302
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.436 line:-2
where they rested on the plate
when we photographed them.


303
00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:43.770 line:-1
In addition, we can add


304
00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:46.006 line:-2
even more physical detail
to the model,


305
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.374 line:-2
as well as make
some improvements


306
00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:48.942 line:-1
to the surface material.


307
00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:51.378 line:-2
These edits are being made
in the sculpting.usd file


308
00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:52.880 line:-1
we created earlier.


309
00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:55.182 line:-2
Since the main scene
is referencing this file,


310
00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.050 line:-2
everyone on the team
will get these updates


311
00:11:57.084 --> 00:11:58.385 line:-1
as they are made.


312
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.289 line:-2
Object Capture looks great,
but you can see the improvement


313
00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:05.759 line:-2
that ZBrush brings by adding
detail and polish to the model.


314
00:12:05.792 --> 00:12:07.327 line:-2
While they already
look scrumptious,


315
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:09.696 line:-2
they could use just
a little bit more sweetening.


316
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:10.864 line:-1
For this task,


317
00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:12.332 line:-2
we'll take our pancakes into
Houdini


318
00:12:12.366 --> 00:12:15.068 line:-2
and add our virtual syrup
and lighting.


319
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.372 line:-1
In Houdini, we can directly load


320
00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:20.941 line:-2
all of our USD files
as native data.


321
00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:23.143 line:-2
Houdini has powerful
procedural tools


322
00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:24.945 line:-2
to generate
all sorts of effects,


323
00:12:24.978 --> 00:12:26.947 line:-2
and we can use it
to pour virtual syrup


324
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.349 line:-1
all over our stack of pancakes.


325
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.385 line:-1
Here's what our scene looks like


326
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:34.588 line:-2
with contributions from Maya,
ZBrush, and Houdini.


327
00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:35.956 line:-1
Everything is brought together,


328
00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:37.991 line:-2
and now we just
need to share it.


329
00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:43.096 line:-2
Fortunately, we're using USD,
and we have a lot of options.


330
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.865 line:-1
We can create a USDZ file


331
00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:46.834 line:-2
and share our scene
in Augmented Reality


332
00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:48.836 line:-1
using AR Quick Look on iOS.


333
00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:51.438 line:-2
On the Mac, we can use
the new built-in features


334
00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:54.308 line:-2
of Preview that Doug
demonstrated earlier.


335
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:56.944 line:-2
Or we can use
a studio-level offline renderer


336
00:12:56.977 --> 00:12:59.046 line:-1
to produce a photo-real video.


337
00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:02.716 line:-2
First, we'll bring
our pancakes into AR.


338
00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:05.118 line:-2
Reality Composer
lets us load our USD scene


339
00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:06.753 line:-1
and make any final adjustments


340
00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:10.757 line:-2
before we save it
as an AR-enabled USDZ file.


341
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:15.395 line:-2
Let's load this up
on the iPad Pro and have a look.


342
00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:20.834 line:-2
Just tap on the USDZ file,
and AR Quick Look opens up.


343
00:13:26.173 --> 00:13:30.177 line:-2
In seconds,
we've created pancakes in AR.


344
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.079 line:-1
Looks delicious.


345
00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:37.751 line:-2
Next, let's check out our scene
in Preview on the Mac.


346
00:13:37.784 --> 00:13:39.253 line:-1
We can navigate the scene,


347
00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:41.321 line:-1
inspect objects, select assets,


348
00:13:41.355 --> 00:13:42.990 line:-1
export them, and share.


349
00:13:43.023 --> 00:13:45.459 line:-1
Everything stays as USD.


350
00:13:46.593 --> 00:13:49.129 line:-2
Finally, we'll create a video
using OTOY's Octane


351
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:52.533 line:-2
to create an offline,
path-traced render of our scene.


352
00:13:52.566 --> 00:13:53.667 line:-1
Whatever changes we make


353
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.302 line:-2
to adjust the lighting
or materials


354
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:58.105 line:-2
can be shared back
in AR or viewed in Preview.


355
00:13:58.138 --> 00:14:00.874 line:-1
USD makes this all possible.


356
00:14:00.908 --> 00:14:04.144 line:-1
From sketch to reality,


357
00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:06.380 line:-2
thanks to USD
and some great tools,


358
00:14:06.413 --> 00:14:10.117 line:-2
we've turned real pancakes
into virtual breakfast.


359
00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:13.253 line:-2
We hope
we've given you a glimpse


360
00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:14.621 line:-1
of how you can use USD


361
00:14:14.655 --> 00:14:18.091 line:-2
to create exciting and complex
3D scenes and assets.


362
00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:19.193 line:-1
All of these software vendors


363
00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:22.229 line:-2
are actively integrating USD
into their products,


364
00:14:22.262 --> 00:14:24.431 line:-2
so we encourage you
to get the latest and greatest


365
00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:27.734 line:-2
and have fun exploring
the universe of USD.


366
00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:29.536 line:-1
For more info on Object Capture,


367
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.106 line:-2
check out this session
from this year's WWDC.


368
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.476 line:-2
We also have several talks
about USD on the Apple platform.


369
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.079 line:-2
Check out this talk
on "What's new in USD"


370
00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:41.114 line:-1
from last year's conference.


371
00:14:41.148 --> 00:14:42.115 line:-1
Thank you.


372
00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:45.485 line:-1
