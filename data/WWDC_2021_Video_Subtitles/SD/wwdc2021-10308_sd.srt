00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:12,946 line:-2
[Dean] So our goals
have always been


5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,583 line:-2
to build great accessibility
into all of our products


6
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,919 line:0
because many of us
navigate our lives


7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,287 align:center
in different ways.


8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,288 line:0
[Chris] At Apple,
we like to think


9
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,957 line:0
of accessibility touching four
different broad categories--


10
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:27,728 align:center
vision, cognitive,
motor, and hearing.


11
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,129 align:center
And we look
at all those segments


12
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,933 line:0
and try to think about
how they impact each product.


13
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.268 line:-2 align:center
Are we doing something
in this area


14
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:35,969 line:-2
where we should have
a different accommodation?


15
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,237 line:-2
Do we have something
that we need


16
00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.873 line:-2 align:center
a special assistive technology
to provide a different way


17
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:41,575 line:-1
to interact with this device?


18
00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:44.011 line:-2 align:center
How do we make
the whole world accessible?


19
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,079 line:0
[Jennifer] Every day,
we're thinking


20
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,915 line:0
about accessibility.


21
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:51,351 align:center
We care because they push
the boundaries


22
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:55,656 line:0
of the experience
in a way that we can't imagine.


23
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,691 align:center
[Ryan]
If you can create


24
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,893 line:0
not just a good
accessibility experience,


25
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,696 align:center
but a great
accessibility experience,


26
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,032 align:center
you'll have a fan for life.


27
00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.668 line:-2 align:center
[Chris] The Watch is a unique
kind of computing platform.


28
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,237 line:-2
It's very personal.
It touches your skin.


29
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,973 line:-2
It also has a long history
of what its use is for,


30
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,541 line:-1
and what its functions are.


31
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,010 line:-2
To make it something accessible,
you really wanna look at--


32
00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:18.278 line:-2 align:center
what is the product
supposed to do?


33
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,380 line:-2
What is its core mission
of what this


34
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,815 line:-1
is gonna bring value for?


35
00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.684 line:-2 align:center
So when you look
at that for the Watch,


36
00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.719 line:-2 align:center
that's when we start to realize,
like, all right, how do we make


37
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.821 line:-2 align:center
this more accessible
for someone who's blind?


38
00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:29.590 line:-2 align:center
What do we do for someone
who's low-vision?


39
00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:31.625 line:-2 align:center
[Ryan] And how do we do it
on a CPU


40
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,161 line:-1
the size of a postage stamp?


41
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,796 line:-2
[Dean] Apple developed
this product,


42
00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.633 line:-2 align:center
and the primary focus was
to be able to read the time,


43
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,070 line:-2
and so the contrast
with the black background


44
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,873 line:-2
with the legible letters
was very important.


45
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,875 line:-2
Well, it turns out
that was also important


46
00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:49.643 line:-1 align:center
for low-vision users,


47
00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:53.547 line:-2 align:center
and it's great for the person
who needs that accessibility,


48
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.583 line:-2 align:center
but it also turns out
to be useful for everyone else.


49
00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:57.818 line:-2 align:center
[Chris] So one
of the great things


50
00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.654 line:-2 align:center
about making a product
accessible by design


51
00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:03.590 line:-2 align:center
is that you do things
that you may not think


52
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,593 line:-2
are necessary,
and I'm reminded of a story


53
00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:08.562 line:-2 align:center
of a woman that I met
who had Usher syndrome.


54
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,731 line:-2
So she came to us and said,
"You know, what's really great


55
00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:13.066 line:-2 align:center
about the Watch
is that I can read the email


56
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,235 line:-2
on this really small screen
because all my vision


57
00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.737 line:-1 align:center
is focused in this central area.


58
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,972 line:-2
It's actually better than
having a big screen."


59
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,441 line:-2
When you sort of invest
in accessibility,


60
00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:24.211 line:-2 align:center
you have to look at things
from a different perspective,


61
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,446 line:-2
and so that often leads
to features


62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,415 line:-2
that become mainstream
over time,


63
00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.484 line:-2 align:center
and I think the Apple Watch
is a great example


64
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,219 line:-2
of showing
a lot of those things,


65
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,888 line:-2
from the large-type watch face
which was designed


66
00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:37.791 line:-2 align:center
for low-vision users but it's
available for everybody.


67
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.593 line:-2 align:center
Part of the thing about
making the Watch accessible


68
00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.628 line:-1 align:center
is what is the primary function?


69
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,164 line:-2
One of those things
was telling the time quickly,


70
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,434 line:-2
and sometimes discreetly,
so that's where Taptic Time


71
00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.736 line:-2 align:center
came into play,
which is a feature


72
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.940 line:-2 align:center
that we have that allows a user
to feel out the time


73
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,275 line:-2
using the haptics
played back to them.


74
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,710 line:-2
[Dean] When we were testing,
one of the things


75
00:02:56.743 --> 00:03:00.247 line:-2 align:center
that I noticed right away
sort of walking around


76
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.250 line:-2 align:center
and using the device,
if I was mobile,


77
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:07,221 line:-2
I had to take one hand
off of my cane,


78
00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:09.690 line:-2 align:center
stop,
and then touch my device.


79
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,125 line:-2
And I thought, "Well, that could
be very dangerous, right?"


80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,560 line:-2
So one of the things
I thought is, "Man,


81
00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:14.561 line:-2 align:center
it would be really great
if I could


82
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,530 line:-2
-just raise my hand..."
-[watch] 1:04 p.m.


83
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,432 line:-2
- And hear the time,
and then I don't have


84
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,201 line:-1
to stop or jeopardize my safety.


85
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:25,105 line:-1
[watch] 1:09 p.m.


86
00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:27.140 line:-2 align:center
[Dean] That's a very, very
simple solution,


87
00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:30.511 line:-2 align:center
but it solves
a very, very important problem.


88
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,246 line:-2
[Chris] But we've learned that
there's more to accessibility


89
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,147 line:-1
than pure technology solutions.


90
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:35.949 line:-2 align:center
[Ryan]
So the Mickey Mouse watch face,


91
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:37,451 line:-1
when it was introduced, I think


92
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,553 line:-2
it really surprised everybody,
especially because it


93
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,189 line:-2
even had some
really neat little features


94
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:45.592 line:-2 align:center
like Mickey's tapping his foot,
but to a low-vision


95
00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:49.429 line:-2 align:center
or blind audience,
if I touched the watch,


96
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,265 line:-2
all I would get
is a description,


97
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,966 line:-1
or maybe, perhaps, the time


98
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.102 line:-2 align:center
spoken by
the same text-to-speech


99
00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:56.703 line:-2 align:center
I hear everywhere else
on the watch face,


100
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,772 line:-1
and that's just not good enough.


101
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,175 line:-2
[Chris] I remember
I was in a presentation,


102
00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:03.544 line:-2 align:center
and I was sitting
in the back row behind someone,


103
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.045 line:-2 align:center
and they were talking about
the Mickey Mouse watch face,


104
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.881 line:-2 align:center
and I heard a woman
in front of me say,


105
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:11,451 line:-2
"Oh, I just really wish
I could hear Mickey speak."


106
00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:13.854 line:-2 align:center
And I turned to the engineer
who was there with me.


107
00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:17.124 line:-2 align:center
I said, "We gotta do something
about this."


108
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,026 line:-2
[Mickey]
It's 9:41.


109
00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:20.127 line:-1 align:center
[laughs]


110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,161 line:-2
[Chris] And we started to look
into this.


111
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,330 line:-2
Why can't we just ask Disney
to work with us


112
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,865 line:-1
to make some of these voices?


113
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,434 line:-1
[Ryan] Disney actually said,


114
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,436 line:-1
"Yeah, let's work on this."


115
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:33,740 line:-2
Well, not only was it going
to be recorded in English,


116
00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:37.444 line:-2 align:center
but it was going to be recorded
in more than 30 languages.


117
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,680 line:-2
[Mickey]
Buongiorno!


118
00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:42.082 line:-2 align:center
- [Speaking
non-English language]


119
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,384 line:-2
- [Speaking non-English
language]


120
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:48,222 line:-2
- The feedback after we
demonstrated our prototype,


121
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,557 line:-2
it wasn't about
is this going to be


122
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.759 line:-1 align:center
a great accessibility feature?


123
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,830 line:-2
What we actually got was
"Can everybody have this?"


124
00:04:56.864 --> 00:04:58.866 line:-2 align:center
[Laughs]
Wow, okay!


125
00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:02.236 line:-2 align:center
[Chris] But the hardest question
was figuring out


126
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,404 line:-1
how often should Mickey laugh?


127
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,541 line:-1
[Mickey laughs]


128
00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:10.477 line:-2 align:center
- One.
One is just not enough.


129
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,246 line:-1
[Mickey laughs]


130
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,914 line:-1
[Ryan] Three is not enough.


131
00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:15.449 line:-1 align:center
No, we need all the laughs.


132
00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:19.453 line:-1 align:center
[Mickey laughs]


133
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,355 line:-2
[Chris] But for
a sighted user using it,


134
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,823 line:-2
they may not want
to hear that as much,


135
00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.491 line:-2 align:center
so we ended
with two different standards.


136
00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:27.828 line:-2 align:center
[Ryan] When VoiceOver is on,
Mickey laughs more often.


137
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,264 line:-1
When VoiceOver is not on,


138
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,399 line:-2
Mickey doesn't laugh
quite as much.


139
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,502 line:-2
[Chris] I remember reading
to my kids at night,


140
00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:36.737 line:-1 align:center
and they would reach over


141
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.839 line:-2 align:center
and just tap
on the Mickey watch face


142
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,741 line:-2
over and over again
to hear him speak.


143
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,376 line:-1
And those are really fun times.


144
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.244 line:-2 align:center
To work on something
that, you know,


145
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,613 line:-2
is for one community,
but it's so cool


146
00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:48.749 line:-2 align:center
that it ends up
affecting everybody.


147
00:05:48.782 --> 00:05:51.685 line:-2 align:center
[Ryan] It's about bringing
to light for a character


148
00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:54.655 line:-2 align:center
that people have loved
for nearly a century.


149
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:55,822 line:-1
[Mickey laughs]


150
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,157 line:-2
[Chris] So one of the--
you know,


151
00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:58.425 line:-1 align:center
the jobs of being a developer,


152
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,728 line:-2
and especially in accessibility,
is to know the landscape


153
00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:03.964 line:-2 align:center
of the technology
so that you can use


154
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,832 line:-2
these things
and solve the problems


155
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,568 line:-1
in new, unique ways.


156
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,603 line:-2
So oftentimes we hear
these stories that people say


157
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,539 line:-2
they love their Watch,
but it can be awkward to use,


158
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,409 line:-2
and that's because
I don't have an arm


159
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,344 line:-2
or another hand
to touch the watch with.


160
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.246 line:-2 align:center
[Jennifer] When we started
trying to meet this need


161
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,415 line:-1
for our users, we thought,


162
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,183 line:-2
"Well, we have
this very smart Watch,


163
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,018 line:-1
and it's on your wrist.


164
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:30,457 line:-2
So could we create
a completely gesture-based


165
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,527 line:-1
human-to-computer interaction?"


166
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,897 line:-2
And we started off
with these more--


167
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,600 line:-2
more sort of,
like, gross gestures.


168
00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:42.870 line:-2 align:center
Lift your arm.
Twist your wrist.


169
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,305 line:-1
And we quickly learned


170
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:49,943 line:-2
that we needed the gesture
that would expend


171
00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:51.845 line:-1 align:center
the least amount of energy,


172
00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:56.116 line:-2 align:center
and we started
with just this pinch gesture,


173
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,052 line:-1
which is pretty low impact.


174
00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:01.054 line:-2 align:center
[Chris] And so we started
to play around and say,


175
00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:02.823 line:-1 align:center
"Well, there's some signal here.


176
00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:04.758 line:-2 align:center
What if we combine
the accelerometer,


177
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,427 line:-2
the gyroscope,
and some of those health sensors


178
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,063 line:-2
that detect heart rate,
and use that to detect


179
00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:13.000 line:-2 align:center
subtle muscle movements
in your arm?


180
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,434 line:-1
Combine that together,


181
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,270 line:-2
put it into
a machine-learning model


182
00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:19.773 line:-2 align:center
to distinguish just these sort of
very minute differences,


183
00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.041 line:-2 align:center
and see
what we got out of that."


184
00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:23.844 line:-2 align:center
- We have a colleague
who has low muscle tone


185
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:27,214 line:-2
in his arms,
and so, he was instrumental


186
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:33,020 line:-2
in testing and really
narrowing down the gestures.


187
00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:37.324 line:-2 align:center
So we discovered
that we can use,


188
00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:41.195 line:-2 align:center
for simple gestures,
pinch, double pinch, clench,


189
00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:42.596 line:-1 align:center
and double clench


190
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,266 line:-2
for complete access
to the Apple Watch.

[Jennifer] Apple Watch
is uniquely suited


199
00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:17.197 line:-2 align:center
to really meet
this need for our users.


200

The interface itself is designed
for focused interactions.


201
00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:24.838 line:-2 align:center
We worked really closely
with our font designers


202
00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:28.709 line:-2 align:center
to add a glyph language
to SF Symbols


203
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,378 line:-2
that basically represents
all of the hardware

of the Apple Watch.

00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,985 line:-2
Then, you have an accelerometer.
We can detect your blood flow.


206
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,453 line:-1
You have a gyroscope.


207
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,289 line:-2
So all of these sensors
on the Watch allow us


208
00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:46.994 line:-2 align:center
to detect even these
very minuscule gestures.

are going to do
with this new technology.

[Ryan] So accessibility
is incredibly important


214
00:08:58.572 --> 00:09:02.309 line:-2 align:center
because it creates equity

more people to use your product?

00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,535 line:-2
Why wouldn't you want to make it
better for everyone?

To me, that sort of gets
to the heart of why we get

You work really hard
on something, on an idea,


233
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:55,128 line:-2
on a concept, and then
you see it come into place,


234
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:58,866 line:-2
and then, even better, you see
how it impacts someone's life.

feeling like that.
