Pierre de Filippis: Hi there.
My name is Pierre.


7
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,014 line:-1
I’m a manager on our
Communication Applications team,


8
00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.417 line:-1 position:50%
and I’ll later be joined
by my colleague Bhaskar.


9
00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:21.421 line:-1 position:50%
It’s my pleasure to welcome you
to “Meet Group Activities.”


10
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.491 line:-1 position:50%
I think we can all recognize
that this past year,


11
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,126 line:-1
finding ways to stay connected


12
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,862 line:-1
has felt more essential
than ever.


13
00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.198 line:-1 position:50%
This is incredibly important
to us at Apple,


14
00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:35.502 line:-1 position:50%
and we wanted to give our users
meaningful new ways to connect.


15
00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.704 line:-1 position:50%
As a result, in iOS 15,


16
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,707 line:-1
we’re creating a new way
to enjoy activities together


17
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,876 line:-1
that makes you feel
like you’re in the same room


18
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,945 line:-1
as the people sharing with you.


19
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:47,948 line:-1
And we call it "SharePlay."


20
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:51,084 line:-1
SharePlay is powered by
the Group Activities framework,


21
00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.186 line:-1 position:50%
and in this session,
we’re going to talk about


22
00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:56.290 line:-1 position:50%
how you can adopt it
in your application.


23
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,392 line:-1
Before we get into
some of those details,


24
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:03,363 line:-1
let me tell you a bit more about
the key components of SharePlay.


25
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,533 line:0
Let’s start with communication.


26
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,069 position:50%
We think dynamic
and natural communication


27
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,104 line:0
is a critically important part


28
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,073 line:0
of a meaningful
shared experience,


29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,677 line:0
so we’ve built SharePlay right
into FaceTime and Messages.


30
00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:18.245 line:-1 position:50%
We are continually blown away


31
00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.381 line:-1 position:50%
by how central these apps
have become in people’s lives


32
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.385 line:-1 position:50%
and relationships,
especially over the last year.


33
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,521 line:-1
And people don’t just use
FaceTime and Messages


34
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:29.523 line:-1 position:50%
to connect with that friend
from 30 years ago


35
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,757 line:-1
once in a while.


36
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,994 line:-1
Instead, our users spend
a significant amount of time


37
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,997 line:-1
communicating with the people
that are closest to them;


38
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:40,033 line:-1
their closest friends,
and their closest family.


39
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,169 line:-1
Those are the kind of people
you would invite


40
00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:44.538 line:-1 position:50%
into your living room
to watch a movie, for example,


41
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:48,775 line:-1
and that’s exactly what we want
to facilitate with SharePlay.


42
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,545 line:-1
Let me give you an idea
of how this works.


43
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,781 line:-1
It all starts with the concept
of a session.


44
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.817 line:-1 position:50%
Before a group
starts an activity,


45
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,920 line:-1
they need to join a session
so that everyone is together


46
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.855 line:-1 position:50%
and ready to share.


47
00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:06.393 line:-1 position:50%
Once users are in a session,
they can communicate via text,


48
00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:09.396 line:-1 position:50%
audio, and video in Messages
and FaceTime


49
00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.398 line:-1 position:50%
just like they are used to.


50
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,734 line:-1
Switching between these modes
of communication


51
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,469 line:-1
is dynamic and fluid,


52
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,771 line:-1
so they can easily choose
a way to communicate


53
00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.107 line:-1 position:50%
that matches the moment.


54
00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:23.443 line:-1 position:50%
We also give users
a consistent system-wide way


55
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,479 line:-1
to manage their session.


56
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,547 line:-1
Users can invite new people
on the fly


57
00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.783 line:-1 position:50%
or leave the session entirely.


58
00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:31.718 line:-1 position:50%
Once you are in a session,


59
00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:35.889 line:-1 position:50%
users can navigate the entire
system and drop in on any app.


60
00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.991 line:-1 position:50%
As a developer,
you get it at all for free


61
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,293 line:-1
with Group Activities.


62
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,529 line:0
So that’s communication.


63
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:46,900 line:0
The next area we think is
critical is platform experience.


64
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,770 position:50%
We want this experience
to be simple, consistent,


65
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,974 line:0
and available across our system
and devices.


66
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,375 line:0
With Group Activities,


67
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,310 position:50%
we’re building
a unified experience


68
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,250 position:50%
that works across iOS,
iPadOS, macOS,


69
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,985 position:50%
where Group Activities
is available


70
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:08,221 position:50%
even for your website
with WebKit.


71
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,223 line:0
It also works beautifully
on AppleTV,


72
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,626 line:0
so you can enjoy it
on the big screen.


73
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:16,029 position:50%
All of your devices are aware
when you are in a session,


74
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,432 position:50%
so you can join from any device,


75
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:22,235 position:50%
and you can use
multiple devices seamlessly.


76
00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:25.172 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, we also designed it
to deliver great audio


77
00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:28.909 line:-1 position:50%
to Bluetooth devices,
including AirPods.


78
00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.677 line:-1 position:50%
As part of platform experience,


79
00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:34.047 line:-1 position:50%
we’re doing something special
for content playback.


80
00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.949 line:-1 position:50%
While we’re hoping
you take full advantage


81
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,051 line:-1
of the expressiveness of the API


82
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.621 line:-1 position:50%
to create many different types
of SharePlay activities,


83
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.057 line:-1 position:50%
we created some
really cool enhancements


84
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.928 line:-1 position:50%
that make shared media
experiences effortless to build.


85
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:51,765 line:-1
The core of any media experience
is the play button;


86
00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:54.167 line:-1 position:50%
it’s the moment
when your users decide


87
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,037 line:-1
what content they want
to spend their time on.


88
00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:59.005 line:-1 position:50%
Our goal is
for every play button


89
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,975 line:-1
throughout the system
to work with SharePlay.


90
00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:05.712 line:-1 position:50%
We want people to feel that
any piece of media in your app


91
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,181 line:-1
is ready to kick off
a shared experience


92
00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:10.750 line:-1 position:50%
whenever they’re on FaceTime
with their friends,


93
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.552 line:-1 position:50%
which is where you come in.


94
00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:14.354 line:-1 position:50%
We’re offering new APIs


95
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,924 line:-1
designed to fit right into
your existing code paths.


96
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,826 line:-1
By adopting Group Activities,


97
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:23,597 line:-1
your play buttons can now start
these shared media experiences


98
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,868 line:-1
whenever a group conversation
is active.


99
00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:31.505 line:-1 position:50%
And we’ll use smarts over time
to adapt to user behaviors,


100
00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:35.142 line:-1 position:50%
making shared experiences
effortless.


101
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,078 line:-1
Next is time-synced playback.


102
00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:39.613 line:-1 position:50%
We think it’s super important


103
00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.748 line:-1 position:50%
that people
are laughing together,


104
00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:42.916 line:-1 position:50%
smiling together,


105
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,653 line:-1
and reacting to content
all at the same time.


106
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,089 line:-1
SharePlay handles
keeping playback time


107
00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:51.491 line:-1 position:50%
synced at the platform level,


108
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,060 line:-1
so you can simply adopt
and not have to worry about


109
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,129 line:-1
rolling your own.


110
00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.698 line:-1 position:50%
Now, this was
a challenging problem to solve


111
00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:02.035 line:-1 position:50%
when it came to consuming
content with SharePlay.


112
00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.904 line:-1 position:50%
We wanted to allow people
to experience


113
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,239 line:-1
the exact same moments
with one another,


114
00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:09.242 line:-1 position:50%
even if they were
halfway across the world.


115
00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.878 line:-1 position:50%
Imagine seeing and hearing
your friends laugh at something


116
00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:13.380 line:-1 position:50%
that hasn’t happened yet.


117
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,981 line:-1
Spoiler alert!


118
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:19,019 line:-1
So we built an entirely new
playback-sync protocol


119
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,821 line:-1
with deep integration
into the AVFoundation stack


120
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,290 line:-1
on the device.


121
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.258 line:-1 position:50%
That means someone hits play,


122
00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.694 line:-1 position:50%
and everyone in the group
immediately starts playback


123
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,329 line:-1
at the same time.


124
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:33.133 line:-1 position:50%
Jump to a favorite scene
and everyone else sees it too,


125
00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:35.435 line:-1 position:50%
allowing people to experience
moments together


126
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,070 line:-1
in perfect sync,


127
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.606 line:-1 position:50%
as if they were
in the same room.


128
00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:42.309 line:-1 position:50%
The magic behind
this playback synchronization


129
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:45.712 line:-1 position:50%
means we won’t retransmit
your media in any way.


130
00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:48.515 line:-1 position:50%
Everyone will get
your full-fidelity video


131
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,850 line:-1
because it’s playing
right from your app


132
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.254 line:-1 position:50%
and streaming from your servers
as it always does.


133
00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:56.323 line:-1 position:50%
And by ensuring that all viewers
are watching


134
00:05:56.323 --> 00:05:58.158 line:-1 position:50%
the highest-quality video,


135
00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:00.961 line:-1 position:50%
they’ll get an immersive
social-viewing experience


136
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:05,265 line:-1
that never compromises
the quality of your content.


137
00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:07.300 line:-1 position:50%
We’re also doing some
groundbreaking work


138
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.570 line:-1 position:50%
to make communication
feel natural during playback.


139
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.938 line:-1 position:50%
With smart volume,


140
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,873 line:-1
when people speak up
during playback,


141
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,843 line:-1
we’ll automatically duck
the audio of the content


142
00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:19.412 line:-1 position:50%
and bring it back up
when appropriate.


143
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,315 line:-1
So people can communicate
via voice, video,


144
00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:24.951 line:-1 position:50%
and text naturally,
just like they would


145
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:27.854 line:-1 position:50%
if they were sitting
in the very same room.


146
00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:29.189 line:-1 position:50%
And of course,


147
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,391 line:-1
it works beautifully
with Picture in Picture,


148
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,827 line:-1
so the user can take
your content along with them


149
00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:36.529 line:-1 position:50%
as they multitask on the device.


150
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,300 position:50%
So that’s a brief overview
of what we’re doing on platform.


151
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,838 line:0
And finally, content.
And that’s where you come in.


152
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:48,108 position:50%
We want users to be able
to enjoy the very best content


153
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,644 position:50%
that you've made available
in your apps.


154
00:06:50.644 --> 00:06:52.646 line:-1 position:50%
When people are on
a FaceTime call,


155
00:06:52.646 --> 00:06:55.181 line:-1 position:50%
they will expect to be able
to go into your app


156
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.450 line:-1 position:50%
and share your content.


157
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,386 line:-1
SharePlay is going to allow you


158
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,688 line:-1
to extend the touchpoints
of your product


159
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:02,956 line:-1
and increase the times


160
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,425 line:-1
where your app is relevant
to your users.


161
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,460 line:-1
And this will happen
very organically.


162
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.597 line:-1 position:50%
Existing users will evangelize
for your app


163
00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:14.167 line:-1 position:50%
as they are using SharePlay
with other people.


164
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,403 line:-1
Now that I’ve given you
a brief overview


165
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,838 line:-1
of some of the key components
of SharePlay,


166
00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:21.841 line:-1 position:50%
let’s turn our attention
to Group Activities,


167
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,477 line:-1
a core concept of the framework.


168
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,814 line:-1
A Group Activity is an object
representing something


169
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,516 line:-1
that can be shared and enjoyed


170
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:33,386 line:-1
with the people in the FaceTime
call using SharePlay.


171
00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:36.222 line:-1 position:50%
Let me walk you through
how a user would start


172
00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:38.325 line:-1 position:50%
a Group Activity in your app.


173
00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:41.661 line:-1 position:50%
While on a call,
users can navigate to your app,


174
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.697 line:-1 position:50%
and if you have adopted
Group Activities,


175
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:48,101 line:-1
they will be notified
that the app supports SharePlay.


176
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,937 line:-1
To configure the activity
you want to share,


177
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,039 line:-1
you first need to create
an object


178
00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.976 line:-1 position:50%
that implements the
GroupActivity protocol.


179
00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.912 line:-1 position:50%
Once you’ve configured
your activity,


180
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,014 line:-1
you call the
prepareForActivation API


181
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,483 line:-1
to start sharing that activity.


182
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.685 line:-1 position:50%
This API will offer the user
the option


183
00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:09.089 line:-1 position:50%
to share that activity with
everyone in the FaceTime call


184
00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:11.224 line:-1 position:50%
or just keep it local.


185
00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:13.426 line:-1 position:50%
If they decide to share
with the group,


186
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,595 line:-1
Group Activities will notify you


187
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,132 line:-1
and let you join
the GroupSession object.


188
00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:21.935 line:-1 position:50%
Once users have joined
the Group Session,


189
00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:24.437 line:-1 position:50%
their video will be kept in sync
with the group,


190
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,440 line:-1
even when they play,
pause, or seek.


191
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.109 line:-1 position:50%
Whenever those events happen,


192
00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:31.845 line:-1 position:50%
Group Activities will
automatically notify the user


193
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.881 line:-1 position:50%
as shown here.


194
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,450 line:-1
And finally,
once users are done,


195
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,753 line:-1
they can choose to end
the activity for themselves


196
00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:41.955 line:-1 position:50%
or for the whole group.


197
00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:44.057 line:-1 position:50%
It’s as simple as that!


198
00:08:44.057 --> 00:08:46.159 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let me hand it over
to Bhaskar


199
00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:49.295 line:-1 position:50%
who's going to walk you through
the rest of this presentation.


200
00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.397 line:-1 position:50%
Bhaskar Sarma: Thank you,
Pierre.


201
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,332 line:-1
Hi, my name is Bhaskar,


202
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,001 line:-1
and I am an engineer
on the FaceTime team.


203
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,437 line:-1
Now let’s talk about some
of the high-level concepts


204
00:08:57.437 --> 00:09:00.573 line:-1 position:50%
and architecture
behind this new framework.


205
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,942 line:-1
GroupActivities
is a Swift-native framework


206
00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:05.912 line:-1 position:50%
that allows you to create
shared experiences


207
00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:08.515 line:-1 position:50%
between users
of your application


208
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,984 line:-1
when they are on
a FaceTime call.


209
00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:14.020 line:-1 position:50%
Additionally, the framework
also has a tight integration


210
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.789 line:-1 position:50%
with AVFoundation,


211
00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:17.690 line:-1 position:50%
which allows you
to easily create


212
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:21.161 line:-1 position:50%
shared video and audio
playback experiences.


213
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,062 line:-1
Before we go over
the high-level concepts


214
00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:24.364 line:-1 position:50%
behind the API,


215
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,200 line:-1
I would like to talk about
two key parts of the API,


216
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.638 line:-1 position:50%
and these are the GroupActivity
and GroupSession.


217
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,873 line:-1
GroupActivity
is what your app uses


218
00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:37.410 line:-1 position:50%
to define the shared experience.


219
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,146 line:-1
It holds the information
that your application needs


220
00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:41.881 line:-1 position:50%
for the shared experience.


221
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,750 line:-1
For example, if you are doing


222
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.853 line:-1 position:50%
a shared audio or video
playback experience,


223
00:09:46.853 --> 00:09:50.690 line:-1 position:50%
it might hold the URL of the
content that is being played.


224
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.225 line:-1 position:50%
Or your application
might provide


225
00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:53.660 line:-1 position:50%
a custom shared experience.


226
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,462 line:-1
For example,
you could be providing


227
00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:57.197 line:-1 position:50%
a draw-together experience.


228
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,766 line:-1
In that case,
this would hold information


229
00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.335 line:-1 position:50%
about what the users
are drawing.


230
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:06,172 line:-1
GroupSession is basically
a representation of the group


231
00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:08.775 line:-1 position:50%
taking part
in the shared experience.


232
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,844 line:-1
It provides access to things


233
00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:13.446 line:-1 position:50%
like the participants
in the group.


234
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,115 line:-1
And there are additional APIs
in the framework


235
00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:18.485 line:-1 position:50%
that you can use along
with the GroupSession


236
00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:21.654 line:-1 position:50%
to send and receive data
across devices.


237
00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:23.656 line:-1 position:50%
Please note the GroupSession


238
00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:26.893 line:-1 position:50%
is not meant to exchange
large amounts of data.


239
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:30,897 line:-1
For example, if you are creating
a shared listening experience,


240
00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:32.799 line:-1 position:50%
the GroupSession is not used


241
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,435 line:-1
to exchange the contents
of the song.


242
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,738 line:-1
Instead, this channel is used
by AVFoundation


243
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,974 line:-1
to keep content in sync


244
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:45,545 line:-1
by exchanging the play,
pause, or seek commands.


245
00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:49.115 line:-1 position:50%
Also, the communication medium
provided by GroupSession


246
00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:51.317 line:-1 position:50%
is end-to-end encrypted.


247
00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.487 line:-1 position:50%
This means no one
other than your application


248
00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.023 line:-1 position:50%
on the device can read the data


249
00:10:57.023 --> 00:11:01.060 line:-1 position:50%
that is exchanged
over this channel.


250
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,763 line:0
Here I have two phones
on the screen.


251
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,965 line:0
The one on the left is my phone,


252
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,002 line:0
and the one on the right
is my teammate Pierre’s phone.


253
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,671 line:0
And we are on a FaceTime call.


254
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,040 line:-1
Also, we have
a sample application


255
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.876 line:-1 position:50%
called "Awesome App"
on the screen,


256
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,046 line:-1
and the app is ready to start
a shared experience


257
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,215 line:-1
between me and Pierre.


258
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:25,351 position:50%
So in this case, the application
on the device on the left


259
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,087 position:50%
is going to initiate
the activity.


260
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,491 position:50%
The first thing the application
needs to do is create an object


261
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,694 line:0
that conforms
to the GroupActivity protocol.


262
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,364 line:0
In the example shown here,
it is the AwesomeActivity object


263
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,135 line:0
that conforms
to GroupActivity.


264
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,803 line:0
As I had mentioned earlier,


265
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,906 line:0
this object conforming
to the GroupActivity protocol


266
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:51,344 line:0
contains information
about the shared activity.


267
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:55,181 position:50%
For example, if you are creating
a shared playback experience,


268
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,018 position:50%
it will have information
about what content to play.


269
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,754 position:50%
Or if you are creating
a custom experience --


270
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,456 line:0
like drawing something
together --


271
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,427 position:50%
it will have information
about what to draw.


272
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,163 position:50%
Once the app has created
an activity,


273
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:13,499 line:0
the next thing it needs to do
is call prepareForActivation


274
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,435 line:0
on the activity.


275
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:19,172 position:50%
This causes the user to see
a prompt asking for permission


276
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,941 position:50%
if they want to start
an activity.


277
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,876 line:0
We would like to take
user consent


278
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,578 position:50%
before starting an activity


279
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,648 position:50%
as we do not want to cause
surprise to them.


280
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:31,351 position:50%
Hence, this step is essential.


281
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,720 position:50%
And lastly, after the user
has granted permission


282
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,988 position:50%
to start the activity,


283
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:38,758 line:0
your app needs to call activate
on the activity object.


284
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,159 position:50%
This tells the system


285
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,631 line:0
that your app wants to start
a shared experience.


286
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,800 position:50%
Next, let’s talk about
observing sessions.


287
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,536 position:50%
Here we have the same app
that we were looking at earlier.


288
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,738 position:50%
The application at this point


289
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:55,174 line:0
has called activate
on the activity object.


290
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,543 position:50%
Your application then needs
to iterate


291
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:01,314 line:0
over incoming sessions
via an AsyncSequence


292
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,916 line:0
on the GroupSession class.


293
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,352 position:50%
And then,
when there is a session,


294
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,088 position:50%
the application gets handed
the GroupSession object


295
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,157 line:0
for the shared experience.


296
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,726 position:50%
Please note that
this is the same step


297
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,328 line:0
your application would take


298
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,296 line:0
whether it was
the initiating app


299
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,768 position:50%
or on the remote device
receiving the session.


300
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,270 position:50%
To go into more details
about initiating


301
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,239 position:50%
and observing group sessions,


302
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:30,777 line:0
I would recommend you watch
this WWDC session.


303
00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:33.680 line:-1 position:50%
Now that the application
has been handed a session,


304
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.949 line:-1 position:50%
it needs to set itself up
before joining the session.


305
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,951 line:-1
Setting up the application
before joining


306
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.253 line:-1 position:50%
could mean different things


307
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:43,156 line:-1
based on the specific use case
of the application.


308
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,426 position:50%
For example, if you are creating
a custom experience --


309
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,294 line:0
like drawing something
together --


310
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,763 position:50%
this could mean loading up
the assets


311
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,832 position:50%
needed for the shared experience


312
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,235 position:50%
before your user
can join the experience.


313
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,204 line:0
However, if your application


314
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,707 line:0
is providing a shared
media-playback experience,


315
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:05,378 position:50%
then it would involve
something like this.


316
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,180 line:0
Your application
will hook up the


317
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,949 line:0
AVPlaybackCoordinator
of your AVPlayer


318
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,050 line:0
to the GroupSession


319
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,787 line:0
so that its associated AVPlayer
can sync content


320
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,858 position:50%
over the communication channel
provided by the framework.


321
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,159 position:50%
Keep in mind,


322
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,529 position:50%
this syncing support
is not just limited to AVPlayer,


323
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,732 line:0
but you can use any other
custom video player


324
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:26,866 line:0
you have today


325
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,701 position:50%
and still get support
for syncing


326
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,971 position:50%
via an AVDelegating
PlaybackCoordinator.


327
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,007 position:50%
And finally, once you are done
setting up your application,


328
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,978 line:0
your application calls join
on the GroupSession.


329
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,647 line:0
Once join is called,
the system sets up


330
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,150 line:0
the end-to-end encrypted
channels between the apps


331
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,053 position:50%
running across
different devices.


332
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,022 position:50%
At this point, your application
is ready to sync data


333
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,826 position:50%
and let your users take part
in the shared experience.


334
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,329 position:50%
If you're creating
a custom experience,


335
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,099 position:50%
your application can use
this channel to exchange data


336
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,468 line:0
to keep your users in sync.


337
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,438 position:50%
This channel is also used
by AVFoundation


338
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,709 line:0
to keep media playback in sync
by exchanging playback state


339
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:14,080 line:0
when the user hits play, pause,
skip, et cetera.


340
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,482 position:50%
Note that this channel
is not meant to be used


341
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,618 position:50%
to exchange
large amounts of data.


342
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,853 line:0
Instead, use it to exchange
information


343
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,989 line:0
to keep your users in sync.


344
00:15:22.989 --> 00:15:25.358 line:-1 position:50%
Now your application
is in a session,


345
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,561 line:-1
and your users are enjoying
the shared experience.


346
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,596 line:-1
There is one more thing
you can do


347
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,933 line:-1
to enrich the experience
for your users,


348
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:37.503 line:-1 position:50%
and that is post events
using the framework.


349
00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:41.240 line:-1 position:50%
Events allow your users to know
what is going on


350
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.109 line:-1 position:50%
in the shared experience.


351
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,712 position:50%
For example, you can post events
to let your users know


352
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:50,983 position:50%
when someone plays, pauses,
or skips a track.


353
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:54,320 line:0
Posting an event causes
the system to present a notice


354
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,489 line:0
telling your users
about the event.


355
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,457 position:50%
In our current API,


356
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,728 position:50%
we only let you post events
for media playback experiences.


357
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:06,165 position:50%
You get this for free
if you use an AVPlayer


358
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,202 position:50%
or use an AVDelegating
PlaybackCoordinator.


359
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:12,338 line:0
However, if you are not using
either of these,


360
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,875 line:0
your app can still post events
using the framework.


361
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,811 position:50%
To learn more about providing
your own custom experience


362
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,413 position:50%
and about posting events,


363
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,816 position:50%
I would recommend you watch
this WWDC session.


364
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,284 line:-1
So to wrap up,


365
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,654 line:-1
Group Activities is a brand new
Swift-native framework


366
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,656 line:-1
that allows you to create
shared experiences


367
00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.558 line:-1 position:50%
over FaceTime.


368
00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:35.561 line:-1 position:50%
The framework is cross-platform
and is available


369
00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:40.967 line:-1 position:50%
on iOS, macOS, iPadOS,
and tvOS.


370
00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:44.070 line:-1 position:50%
It has tight integration
with AVFoundation


371
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.738 line:-1 position:50%
that allows your app to provide


372
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,841 line:-1
shared media playback
experiences.


373
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,778 line:-1
And finally, it also has support
for playback syncing


374
00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:56.082 line:-1 position:50%
over the web on macOS.


375
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,950 line:-1
And with that,
I would like to thank you


376
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.418 line:-1 position:50%
for watching our session.


377
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,787 line:-1
And have a wonderful WWDC21!
