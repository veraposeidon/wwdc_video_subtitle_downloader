00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,778 line:-2
[Harrison] Hi, I'm Harrison
from the Game Center team.


4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,347 line:-2
Thanks for joining me
to learn about using


5
00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.682 line:-2 align:center
recurring leaderboards
in your games.


6
00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.218 line:-2 align:center
Game Center provides a convenient
identity players can use


7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,954 line:-2
to access their data across
many of their games.


8
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,190 line:-2
As a developer,
Game Center allows you to easily


9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,360 line:-2
add features like achievements,
multiplayer, and leaderboards,


10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.195 line:-2 align:center
which is what I'm here
to talk about today.


11
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,863 line:-2
As this is a code-along,
you'll need to do


12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,699 line:-2
some initial setup
in order to participate.


13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,168 line:-1
Then, I'll give a quick recap


14
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:36,503 line:-2
of Game Center's
leaderboard types


15
00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:39.139 line:-2 align:center
and walk through
the provided sample game.


16
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:42,543 line:-2
Finally, I'll add a recurring
leaderboard in App Store Connect,


17
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:46,213 line:-2
and show a couple different ways
to use it in the sample game.


18
00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.081 line:-1 align:center
Let's start with some setup.


19
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,852 line:-2
We've provided a project
compatible with Xcode 13


20
00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.221 line:-2 align:center
in the developer portal
to get you started.


21
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,690 line:-2
I encourage you to pause
the video and download that now.


22
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,727 line:-2
After it's downloaded,
resume, and I'll walk you


23
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,064 line:-1
through some initial setup.


24
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,465 line:-1
In the folder you downloaded,


25
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,901 line:-2
you'll find an Xcode
project called The Coast.


26
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,304 line:-1
Go ahead and open that now.


27
00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:11.805 line:-2 align:center
Since you're going
to modify this app


28
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,407 line:-1
to use Game Center features,


29
00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.809 line:-2 align:center
it needs to be registered
with your team.


30
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:19,413 line:-1
Follow along, pausing as needed.


31
00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:24.618 line:-2 align:center
First, select TheCoast project
file from the project navigator.


32
00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:29.289 line:-2 align:center
Then, select TheCoast
from the list of Targets.


33
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,391 line:-2
In the Signing
& Capabilities pane,


34
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.694 line:-2 align:center
choose your
team from the Team menu.


35
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,096 line:-2
If your Apple ID or team isn't
in the menu,


36
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.564 line:-2 align:center
first choose
Add an Account


37
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,033 line:-2
and enter
your Apple ID information.


38
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,070 line:-2
Next, set the bundle
ID to a unique identifier.


39
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,006 line:-2
You must change the bundle ID
to proceed.


40
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,708 line:-2
If prompted,
click Register Device


41
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,776 line:-2
to create a provisioning
profile.


42
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,679 line:-2
Once you've successfully
registered,


43
00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.681 line:-2 align:center
there won't be any warnings
listed under the status.


44
00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.318 line:-2 align:center
Now that your chosen
bundle ID is registered,


45
00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:01.822 line:-2 align:center
you can add an app record
to App Store Connect.


46
00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:04.124 line:-2 align:center
In the top right corner
of App Store Connect,


47
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,828 line:-2
select the team you used
when registering your bundle ID.


48
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,798 line:-2
Then, navigate to the My Apps
section.


49
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,035 line:-2
Click the plus button in the top
left corner,


50
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,571 line:-1
and select New App.


51
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,540 line:-2
You'll be
working on an iOS-only app,


52
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,409 line:-1
so select iOS as the platform.


53
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:26,246 line:-2
Pick an appropriate name,
primary language, and SKU.


54
00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.715 line:-2 align:center
For bundle ID, make sure you
choose the bundle ID


55
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,984 line:-1
you registered in Xcode.


56
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.253 line:-2 align:center
After all the required
fields are filled out,


57
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,190 line:-2
select Create to add
your app record.


58
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.992 line:-2 align:center
You'll be coming back to
App Store Connect a little later.


59
00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.962 line:-2 align:center
But now, I'm going to give
a quick recap of leaderboards.


60
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,500 line:-2
All of our leaderboards let
players see how well they rank


61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,936 line:-2
against friends
and players around the world.


62
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,737 line:-2
Our leaderboard types
primarily differ


63
00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.906 line:-2 align:center
by how long
the leaderboard is active.


64
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,544 line:-2
Classic leaderboards are
always active, with no ending.


65
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,213 line:-2
They maintain an all-time
ranking,


66
00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:02.683 line:-2 align:center
as well as rolling weekly
and daily rankings.


67
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,185 line:-2
They're particularly useful
for cumulative scores,


68
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.154 line:-2 align:center
like total experience points
earned


69
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:10,123 line:-1
or current number of coins.


70
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,859 line:-2
Recurring leaderboards,
on the other hand,


71
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,160 line:-1
are short-lived leaderboards


72
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.362 line:-2 align:center
that repeat
on a developer-defined schedule,


73
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,665 line:-2
like every 5 minutes
or every 30 days.


74
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,200 line:-2
You can retrieve
a currently active


75
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.503 line:-2 align:center
leaderboard occurrence,
and you can also retrieve


76
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,571 line:-2
the most recently finished
occurrence that a player


77
00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:28.842 line:-2 align:center
has submitted to, for up to 30
days after its end time.


78
00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:31.011 line:-2 align:center
Recurring leaderboards
are useful for periodic,


79
00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:33.046 line:-2 align:center
timed events,
like a 1-hour challenge


80
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,281 line:-1
every Sunday at noon,


81
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,884 line:-1
or a new leaderboard every week.


82
00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:38.652 line:-2 align:center
I'm going to highlight
a specific use case


83
00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:41.154 line:-2 align:center
for recurring leaderboards
during the session.


84
00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:43.357 line:-2 align:center
But first,
let's go back to the project


85
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,758 line:-1
you opened in Xcode.


86
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,628 line:-2
Build and run it on an iOS
device or a simulator.


87
00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:53.166 line:-2 align:center
This is the title
screen of The Coast.


88
00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.003 line:-2 align:center
For now, this screen just has
a button to start the game.


89
00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:58.906 line:-2 align:center
Go ahead
and tap on "PLAY."


90
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,441 line:-2
Gameplay
is pretty straightforward:


91
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:04.444 line:-2 align:center
when you see a ship,
tap on it to get a point.


92
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,680 line:-1
Each session lasts 60 seconds.


93
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.082 line:-2 align:center
At the end,
you'll have the option to retry


94
00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.652 line:-1 align:center
or return to the title screen.


95
00:04:11.652 --> 00:04:14.221 line:-2 align:center
If you select the menu button
in the top right corner,


96
00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:16.657 line:-1 align:center
you can finish early.


97
00:04:16.657 --> 00:04:18.892 line:-1 align:center
So, how is this implemented?


98
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.865 line:-2 align:center
I'm going to highlight a couple
of the main classes to start.


99
00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:27.034 line:-2 align:center
TitleScreenViewController
is responsible


100
00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:28.702 line:-1 align:center
for the title screen.


101
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,605 line:-2
In a bit, it will be used
to authenticate with Game Center.


102
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.740 line:-2 align:center
For now, it's mainly
responsible for presenting


103
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,243 line:-2
GameViewController when
the PLAY button is tapped.


104
00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.014 line:-2 align:center
GameViewController
is pretty simple.


105
00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.517 line:-2 align:center
It brings up a SpriteKit scene,
called GameScene,


106
00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:45.986 line:-2 align:center
when the view is loaded,
and has a delegate method


107
00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:49.256 line:-2 align:center
called endGame for going back
to the title screen.


108
00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:52.025 line:-2 align:center
Let's look at GameScene, which
manages all the gameplay logic.


109
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:58,932 line:-2
When it's presented, it sets up
a couple of SpriteKit nodes.


110
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:02,069 line:-2
One is a node created
with a background image.


111
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,571 line:-2
This is scaled based on your
device's screen size,


112
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,808 line:-2
and all of the other nodes
are added to it as children.


113
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:11,078 line:-2
Another is scoreLabel,
an SKLabelNode


114
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:13,213 line:-2
positioned
in the top left of the screen


115
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,883 line:-1
displaying the current score.


116
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,986 line:-2
The last is a CountdownNode,
which shows players how much


117
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:23,390 line:-2
time they have left and notifies
the GameScene when time is up.


118
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,691 line:-1
With those nodes added,


119
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.794 line:-2 align:center
the setupBoatNodeWithActions()
method is called.


120
00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:33.100 line:-2 align:center
This kicks off a sequence
of SpriteKit actions


121
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,469 line:-2
to fade in and fade out
boat sprites


122
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,538 line:-2
over the course
of the session.


123
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,775 line:-2
The touchesEnded method is
overridden to remove


124
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,545 line:-2
those boat sprites when tapped
and increment the score.


125
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,850 line:-2
At the end of the countdown,
in the timeIsUp method,


126
00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:55.255 line:-2 align:center
all nodes are removed
from the background


127
00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:57.824 line:-2 align:center
and a menu with the final
score is displayed.


128
00:05:57.824 --> 00:06:00.561 line:-2 align:center
There are lots of ways recurring
leaderboards can be leveraged


129
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,130 line:-2
to improve the experience
of The Coast for players,


130
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,799 line:-2
but today,
I'm going to focus on three.


131
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,769 line:-2
First, I'll show you how
to establish a daily competition


132
00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:10.704 line:-2 align:center
by creating a 24-hour recurring
leaderboard,


133
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,673 line:-2
and show how to link to
Game Center's


134
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,775 line:-1
default leaderboard UI.


135
00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:17.744 line:-2 align:center
This is probably the easiest way
to add a recurring leaderboard,


136
00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.479 line:-2 align:center
and it's a great way
to let players find out


137
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,615 line:-2
how they stack up against
others.


138
00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:23.450 line:-2 align:center
The daily cadence ensures
that everyone will have


139
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.254 line:-2 align:center
fresh opportunities
to earn a top spot.


140
00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:31.058 line:-2 align:center
Next, we're going to display
live rankings during gameplay.


141
00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:32.726 line:-2 align:center
This adds
a lot of excitement to the game,


142
00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.661 line:-2 align:center
as players get to see
in real time


143
00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:38.899 line:-2 align:center
how well they're doing and how
close they are to the top spot.


144
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,767 line:-2
Finally, we'll use ranks
from the current


145
00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:42.236 line:-1 align:center
and previous occurrences


146
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,205 line:-2
to show how a player
is changing over time.


147
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,174 line:-2
This is a really simple
way to give players


148
00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:49.409 line:-1 align:center
a sense of progress in the game.


149
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,345 line:-1
Let's get started.


150
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,380 line:-2
I mentioned earlier
that I'll be using


151
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,349 line:-2
a daily
recurring leaderboard.


152
00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.484 line:-2 align:center
Before you can use
a leaderboard in your game,


153
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,887 line:-2
you need to configure
it in App Store Connect.


154
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:02,322 line:-2
Pull that up in Safari
now and open your app.


155
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:05.659 line:-1 align:center
Navigate to the Features tab,


156
00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.694 line:-2 align:center
and make sure that Game Center
is selected.


157
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,430 line:-2
Then, click the plus button
next to leaderboards,


158
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,134 line:-2
and choose the recurring
leaderboard option.


159
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,869 line:-2
Both classic and recurring
leaderboards


160
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,438 line:-2
have these six fields
to configure.


161
00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.541 line:-2 align:center
The leaderboard reference
name is used internally


162
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:21.975 line:-1 align:center
in App Store Connect.


163
00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:24.845 line:-2 align:center
Pick something descriptive,
like "DailyHighScore."


164
00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:26.580 line:-2 align:center
The leaderboard ID
is used to reference


165
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,682 line:-1
your leaderboard within the app.


166
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,817 line:-2
For simplicity,
I'm just going to use the same


167
00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:34.388 line:-2 align:center
descriptive value I used
for the reference name.


168
00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:36.757 line:-2 align:center
Score format type determines
how scores are formatted


169
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,559 line:-1
in the Game Center UI.


170
00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:40.961 line:-2 align:center
The Coast's scores
are just integers,


171
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:44.631 line:-2 align:center
but other games might
use time or money.


172
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.300 line:-2 align:center
If a player submits
multiple scores


173
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,202 line:-2
to the same
leaderboard occurrence,


174
00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:49.736 line:-2 align:center
the score submission
type determines


175
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,171 line:-1
which one gets ranked:


176
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,941 line:-2
either the best score
or the most recent.


177
00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:56.243 line:-2 align:center
Use best for The Coast,
since you want to record


178
00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:59.213 line:-2 align:center
a player's highest score
for the day.


179
00:07:59.213 --> 00:08:01.415 line:-2 align:center
Sort order determines
how players' scores


180
00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:03.217 line:-1 align:center
are ranked against each other.


181
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,385 line:-2
For The Coast, high scores are
better,


182
00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:07.955 line:-1 align:center
so choose High to Low.


183
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,924 line:-2
You can optionally define
a range for valid scores.


184
00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:14.094 line:-2 align:center
Any score outside of that
range will be rejected.


185
00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:17.364 line:-2 align:center
This is useful as a mitigation
against cheating.


186
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,434 line:-2
I'm going to set a minimum of 0
and maximum of 200,


187
00:08:20.434 --> 00:08:22.236 line:-2 align:center
since I don't reasonably
expect players


188
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,905 line:-1
to score outside of that range.


189
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,306 line:-2
Recurring
leaderboards have these


190
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,342 line:-1
additional required fields.


191
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,177 line:-2
Start Date and Time
is the date and time


192
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,714 line:-2
of the first occurrence
of the leaderboard, in UTC.


193
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,516 line:-2
You can't choose a start
in the past,


194
00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:37.851 line:-2 align:center
so choose a date and time
in the immediate future,


195
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.720 line:-2 align:center
like in one minute,
so that you can begin


196
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.856 line:-2 align:center
using the leaderboard
right away.


197
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,858 line:-2
Duration is the length
of time that scores


198
00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.894 line:-1 align:center
can be posted for a leaderboard.


199
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:51,198 line:-2
This is, of course, one day
for the daily leaderboard.


200
00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:53.567 line:-2 align:center
Restarts Every
specifies the frequency


201
00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:56.770 line:-2 align:center
that new occurrences
of the leaderboard are created.


202
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.206 line:-2 align:center
The frequency is required
to be greater than or equal to


203
00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:02.676 line:-2 align:center
the duration, so that
occurrences will not overlap.


204
00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:05.512 line:-2 align:center
The Coast doesn't need any
gap between occurrences,


205
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:09,216 line:-2
so set this
equal to the duration.


206
00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:11.585 line:-2 align:center
Here's a diagram showing
how these fields interact


207
00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:13.854 line:-1 align:center
to produce occurrences.


208
00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:17.457 line:-2 align:center
At the start date you select,
say June 11 at 9:00 a.m.,


209
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,426 line:-1
an occurrence is created.


210
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,662 line:-2
You can submit to this
occurrence for one day


211
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,164 line:-2
because of the configured
duration.


212
00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:26.567 line:-2 align:center
Immediately after that
occurrence expires,


213
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,168 line:-1
June 12 at 9:00 a.m.,


214
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,304 line:-2
a new occurrence is created,
because the restart


215
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:32,639 line:-2
is configured
to match the duration.


216
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,844 line:-2
This process
continues indefinitely.


217
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:40,180 line:0
The last thing to configure
is the localization information.


218
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,683 align:center
Leaderboards need this
in order to display properly


219
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,518 align:center
in Game Center UI.


220
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,453 line:0
At least one language
must be configured.


221
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:50,324 line:0
I'm going
to configure for English.


222
00:09:50.324 --> 00:09:51.758 line:-2 align:center
Pick an appropriate
display name,


223
00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.962 line:-2 align:center
like "Daily High Score"
for a daily leaderboard.


224
00:09:54.962 --> 00:09:57.231 line:-2 align:center
You also
need to pick a score format.


225
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,999 line:-2
For an integer type,
you can use periods


226
00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:01.301 line:-2 align:center
or commas
as the thousands separator.


227
00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:04.571 line:-2 align:center
Select one that makes
sense for your language.


228
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,640 line:-2
The score format suffix
is a way to specify


229
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.810 line:-2 align:center
the unit of your score,
like points or hits.


230
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,913 line:-2
I'm just going to leave this
blank for The Coast.


231
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,582 line:-2
Leaderboard image is optional,
but it's recommended


232
00:10:15.582 --> 00:10:17.050 line:-2 align:center
because it
gives a customized look


233
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.720 line:-2 align:center
for your game
in the Game Center UI.


234
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.555 line:-2 align:center
There's an image provided
in the Assets directory


235
00:10:21.555 --> 00:10:24.424 line:-2 align:center
of the project for you to use
here, named leaderboardImage.


236
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,859 line:-1
Upload that.


237
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.228 line:-2 align:center
Once you've
saved the leaderboard,


238
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,663 line:-2
you can authenticate
with Game Center


239
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,732 line:-1
and use it in your game.


240
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:35,068 line:-2
So, let's start by enabling
Game Center authentication.


241
00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:36.770 line:-2 align:center
In the
TitleScreenViewController,


242
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,805 line:-2
there's a method called
authenticateLocalPlayer(),


243
00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:42.743 line:-1 align:center
with the body commented out.


244
00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:44.811 line:-1 align:center
Go ahead and uncomment it.


245
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,748 line:-2
This code
sets the authentication handler


246
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,383 line:-2
on the local player,
which will trigger


247
00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:52.085 line:-2 align:center
a Game Center log-in flow
on start.


248
00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:53.353 line:-1 align:center
If you need more information,


249
00:10:53.353 --> 00:10:56.356 line:-2 align:center
follow the provided
link to documentation.


250
00:10:56.356 --> 00:10:58.959 line:-1 align:center
Now, we can submit scores.


251
00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:01.662 line:-2 align:center
Earlier, I showed you the method
in GameScene that updates


252
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,765 line:-2
the score when a touch ends,
called touchesEnded.


253
00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:06.800 line:-1 align:center
Navigate to that.


254
00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:13.574 line:-2 align:center
There are
two submitScore methods.


255
00:11:13.574 --> 00:11:16.643 line:-2 align:center
One is a class method,
and one is an instance method.


256
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,612 line:-2
When you submit to the class
method,


257
00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:20.547 line:-2 align:center
the submission will go to
whatever occurrence


258
00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:22.182 line:-1 align:center
is currently active.


259
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,152 line:-2
It will only fail if there isn't
an active occurrence.


260
00:11:25.152 --> 00:11:28.255 line:-2 align:center
To use the instance method,
you first load a GKLeaderboard


261
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,390 line:-2
representing
the current occurrence.


262
00:11:34.428 --> 00:11:37.865 line:-2 align:center
Then, when you submit a score
in the completion handler,


263
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:41,435 line:-2
it will only succeed if
that occurrence is still active.


264
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:52,312 line:-2
Consider a game that offers
a unique challenge every hour,


265
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,915 line:-2
using an hourly recurring
leaderboard.


266
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,885 line:-2
You wouldn't want any scores
from one challenge to leak into


267
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,152 line:-1
the next challenge's occurrence,


268
00:11:59.152 --> 00:12:00.787 line:-1 align:center
say due to network delays


269
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:03,423 line:-2
between a player's
device and the server.


270
00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:06.727 line:-2 align:center
The instance submit score method
ensures that won't happen.


271
00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:08.962 line:-2 align:center
The Coast's daily
leaderboard isn't tied


272
00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:11.098 line:-2 align:center
to a particular game session,
so it doesn't matter


273
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,133 line:-2
what occurrence receives
the score.


274
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:18,305 line:-1
Let's just use the class method.


275
00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:35.589 line:-1 align:center
Now, the score will be submitted


276
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,659 line:-2
to the currently active
leaderboard occurrence.


277
00:12:38.659 --> 00:12:41.295 line:-2 align:center
Note that
I'm setting the context to 0.


278
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:42,930 line:-2
The context can be used
to encode


279
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,598 line:-2
some game-specific
information


280
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,200 line:-1
and store it with the score.


281
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.504 line:-2 align:center
For The Coast, scores don't need
any additional context.


282
00:12:50.504 --> 00:12:53.006 line:-2 align:center
Now that you're submitting
to the daily leaderboard,


283
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,776 line:-2
let's add a button to show
the leaderboard in Game Center UI


284
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,411 line:-1
from the title screen.


285
00:12:57,411 --> 00:13:00,547 line:-2
First, head to the
TitleScreenViewController.


286
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,620 line:-2
You'll need to create
a new IBAction method.


287
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:15,262 line:-1
Call it showLeaderboardVC.


288
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,603 line:-2
Instantiate
a GKGameCenterViewController.


289
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:34,314 line:-1
Pass in a leaderboardID,


290
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:43,557 line:-2
a playerScope--
I'm using global--


291
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,325 line:-1
and a timeScope.


292
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:49,196 line:-2
For recurring leaderboards,
timeScope must be allTime.


293
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,904 line:-2
Set the gameCenterDelegate
to "self."


294
00:14:01.275 --> 00:14:03.343 line:-1 align:center
Then, present it.


295
00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:14.087 line:-2 align:center
You also
need to create a UIButton.


296
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.533 line:-2 align:center
I'm just calling mine
leaderboardButton.


297
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:36,210 line:-2
Then, wire everything
up in the main storyboard.


298
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.345 line:-2 align:center
We've provided a leaderboard
glyph for you to use


299
00:14:38.345 --> 00:14:41.114 line:-1 align:center
in the assets directory.


300
00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:43.984 line:-2 align:center
Add a button with that image,
and remove the text.


301
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,220 line:-2
I'm going to set an aspect ratio
constraint


302
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,689 line:-2
to ensure the glyph
doesn't get stretched out.


303
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,628 line:-2
Then, position it next
to the PLAY button.


304
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,901 line:-2
Set the Touch Up Inside
event to your new method.


305
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,877 line:-2
And set a New Referencing
Outlet to your new button.


306
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:17,885 line:-2
Now, build and run the app
to try out your new leaderboard.


307
00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:30.631 line:-2 align:center
You might be prompted
to log in to Game Center.


308
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,799 line:-2
Do that now, since an
authenticated account


309
00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:36.036 line:-2 align:center
is required for leaderboards
to work.


310
00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:38.272 line:-2 align:center
Tapping the leaderboard
glyph takes you directly


311
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:42,309 line:-2
to the leaderboard
in Game Center UI.


312
00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:45.479 line:-2 align:center
If you haven't played yet,
the leaderboard will be empty.


313
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,748 line:-2
Play briefly, and check back
in on the leaderboard


314
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:54,755 line:-1
to see your new score.


315
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:12,973 line:-2
Now that you have a leaderboard
and are submitting scores,


316
00:16:12.973 --> 00:16:15.509 line:-2 align:center
let's add in live scores
during gameplay.


317
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.748 line:-2 align:center
Take a look
at the LeaderboardNode class.


318
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,523 line:-2
This is a SpriteKit
node that takes a list


319
00:16:29.523 --> 00:16:32.793 line:-2 align:center
of leaderboard entries
consisting of names and scores,


320
00:16:32.793 --> 00:16:34.995 line:-2 align:center
then displays them according
to rank.


321
00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:37.264 line:-2 align:center
It can be initialized
with entries and updated


322
00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:39.499 line:-1 align:center
when the entries need to change.


323
00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:43.537 line:-2 align:center
Add an optional leaderboardNode
as a member of GameScene.


324
00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:00.087 line:-2 align:center
We initialize the leaderboard
position


325
00:17:00.087 --> 00:17:02.256 line:-1 align:center
in setupInitialGameplay.


326
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:05,626 line:-2
Initialize
the node right under that.


327
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,674 line:-2
I'm configuring it
with five rows,


328
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:22,976 line:-2
and leaving
the initial entries blank.


329
00:17:34.955 --> 00:17:38.692 line:-2 align:center
Add it to the backgroundNode
to display it in your scene.


330
00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:50.804 line:-2 align:center
Now, we need to load entries
and update the leaderboard.


331
00:17:50.804 --> 00:17:51.972 line:-1 align:center
I'm going to create


332
00:17:51.972 --> 00:17:55.175 line:-2 align:center
an updateLeaderboardNode
function for this.


333
00:18:02.482 --> 00:18:05.586 line:-2 align:center
First, load
the DailyHighScore leaderboard.


334
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,729 line:-2
In the completion handler,
use the leaderboard


335
00:18:15.729 --> 00:18:21.401 line:-2 align:center
to load the top five entries
from the global leaderboard.


336
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,337 line:-2
Since this
is a recurring leaderboard,


337
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:25,772 line:-2
the timeScope will
always be allTime.


338
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:40,754 line:-2
Once these have loaded,
you'll need to convert


339
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:43,657 line:-2
the GameKit entries into
the LeaderboardEntry struct


340
00:18:43.657 --> 00:18:45.025 line:-1 align:center
that LeaderboardNode uses


341
00:18:45.025 --> 00:18:47.461 line:-1 align:center
if the entries aren't nil.


342
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:07,481 line:-1
[typing]


343
00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:26.300 line:-2 align:center
Then, call the LeaderboardNode’s
updateEntries method.


344
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:40,514 line:-2
The last step is to update
the LeaderboardNode


345
00:19:40.514 --> 00:19:42.149 line:-1 align:center
throughout gameplay.


346
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:44,918 line:-2
In this game, the player's score
is frequently changing,


347
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,487 line:-2
and you should keep
the LeaderboardNode in sync.


348
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,690 line:-2
To do that,
call updateLeaderboardNode()


349
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.025 line:-2 align:center
in the completion
handler for submitScore.


350
00:20:03.537 --> 00:20:05.205 line:-2 align:center
To properly
display the leaderboard


351
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,640 line:-1
before a player has scored,


352
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,310 line:-2
also call immediately after
the node has been created.


353
00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:23.056 line:-2 align:center
Now, I'm
going to build and run again.


354
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.903 line:-2 align:center
I have a couple friends playing
the game along with me.


355
00:20:35.903 --> 00:20:38.105 line:-2 align:center
You can see the leaderboard
continuously update


356
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:43,143 line:-1
as our scores increase.


357
00:20:57.991 --> 00:21:01.662 line:-2 align:center
The last change I'm making
is to show how a player's


358
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:05,098 line:-2
current daily rank differs
from their previous daily rank.


359
00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:07.034 line:-2 align:center
I'm going to put this
in the GameMenuNode


360
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:09,102 line:-1
when the time is up.


361
00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:16.276 line:-2 align:center
I could use a series
of nested completion handlers


362
00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.245 line:-2 align:center
to implement this,
but using GameKit's


363
00:21:18.245 --> 00:21:21.381 line:-2 align:center
new async methods will make
this code more readable.


364
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,983 line:-1
Create a new async method.


365
00:21:22.983 --> 00:21:25.652 line:-2 align:center
Let's call
it addRankToGameMenu().


366
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.432 line:-2 align:center
Since GameKit's async
methods can throw,


367
00:21:38.432 --> 00:21:39.733 line:-1 align:center
you'll want to catch any errors.


368
00:21:39.733 --> 00:21:41.869 line:-1 align:center
I'm just going to log them.


369
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:47,040 line:-2
Load the daily leaderboard
and confirm


370
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:53,413 line:-2
that it
was successfully returned.


371
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,350 line:-2
With that leaderboard instance,
do two things.


372
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,619 line:-2
First, asynchronously
load entries


373
00:21:58.619 --> 00:22:01.255 line:-1 align:center
with async let.


374
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:03,457 line:-2
I'm leaving
the for parameter empty,


375
00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:06.460 line:-2 align:center
since I only care about
the local player's score.


376
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:11,598 line:-2
Second, asynchronously
load the previous occurrence


377
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:15,269 line:-2
of the leaderboard and use
that to load entries.


378
00:22:20.274 --> 00:22:22.442 line:-2 align:center
I'll need to write a method
on the gameMenuNode


379
00:22:22.442 --> 00:22:24.478 line:-1 align:center
to display this information.


380
00:22:24.478 --> 00:22:27.014 line:-1 align:center
Let's call it addRankNode.


381
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:41.428 line:-2 align:center
Pass in the current
and previous ranks.


382
00:22:55.909 --> 00:23:00.147 line:-2 align:center
You'll need to use try await
to wait for them to be ready.


383
00:23:04.218 --> 00:23:06.220 line:-2 align:center
Go ahead and call the new
async method


384
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,189 line:-1
in a detach block from timeIsUp.


385
00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:27.574 line:-2 align:center
Then, head to GameMenuNode
to implement addRankNode.


386
00:23:41,455 --> 00:23:43,891 line:-2
addRankNode is going to generate
some simple text


387
00:23:43.891 --> 00:23:47.861 line:-2 align:center
using the difference between
the previous and current rank.


388
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:05.846 line:-2 align:center
If both ranks are nil,
you can just return.


389
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:08,015 line:-2
Display
your text in a label node.


390
00:24:08.015 --> 00:24:13.053 line:-2 align:center
I'm using a helper
function to create that.


391
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:31,305 line:-1
Position it appropriately.


392
00:24:36.443 --> 00:24:39.780 line:-2 align:center
I'm going to add it
centered horizontally


393
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.983 line:-2 align:center
and slightly below center
vertically.


394
00:24:52.292 --> 00:24:54.428 line:-1 align:center
Then, add it to the background.


395
00:25:02.903 --> 00:25:05.072 line:-1 align:center
Now, let's see the result.


396
00:25:12.513 --> 00:25:15.816 line:-2 align:center
I played yesterday, so I have
a previous rank available.


397
00:25:15.816 --> 00:25:18.352 line:-2 align:center
As you can see, my rank is
down a little bit today,


398
00:25:18.352 --> 00:25:21.555 line:-1 align:center
a good reason to keep playing.


399
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:23,156 line:0
In this session,
I've shown you how to get


400
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:25,659 align:center
a recurring leaderboard set up
in App Store Connect,


401
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:29,062 align:center
and then how to use it in your
game, by submitting scores,


402
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:31,465 line:0
linking to Game Center's
own leaderboard UI,


403
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:34,601 align:center
and using the leaderboard APIs
to display live global ranks,


404
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:37,004 line:0
and ranks from
a previous occurrence.


405
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:39,206 line:-2
For even more information
on recurring leaderboards,


406
