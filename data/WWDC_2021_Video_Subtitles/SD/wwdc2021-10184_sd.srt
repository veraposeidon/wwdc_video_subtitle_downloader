[Ian] Welcome to “Design
for Group Activities.”


4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,883 line:-2
I’m Ian Baird, manager
of the FaceTime team at Apple.


5
00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.218 line:-2 align:center
In this session,
we are going to talk about


6
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,954 line:-2
designing a great experience
using Group Activities,


7
00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:24.758 line:-2 align:center
but before we get started, let’s
recap what Group Activities are


8
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,661 line:-1
and how it relates to SharePlay.


9
00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.596 line:-2 align:center
Group Activities is
the framework


10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,832 line:-2
which plugs your app
into SharePlay.


11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,368 line:-2
It also provides the capability
for messaging


12
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.770 line:-2 align:center
and synchronizing
media playback.


13
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,539 line:-1
But before we get started,


14
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:42,109 line:-2
I’d like to share the promise
of Group Activities with you.


15
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:45,279 line:-2
Imagine you had access
to a framework backed


16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,782 line:-2
by a world-class low-latency
networking infrastructure,


17
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,119 line:-2
allowing you to privately
and securely reach anyone


18
00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.521 line:-2 align:center
in the world
using an Apple device.


19
00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.224 line:-2 align:center
That’s the powerful system
behind FaceTime,


20
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,661 line:-2
which is now open
to you with Group Activities.


21
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,563 line:-2
With the power
of Group Activities,


22
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,233 line:-2
you can watch a movie
with a distant relative,


23
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.302 line:-2 align:center
shoot
the perfect three-pointer,


24
00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.671 line:-2 align:center
share photos
of your amazing vacation


25
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,841 line:-2
with friends and family,
or learn a new language,


26
00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:17.444 line:-2 align:center
like Swift using Swift
Playgrounds and screen sharing.


27
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:20,047 line:-2
My friend just found
a new house in Nashville


28
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.515 line:-1 align:center
and wants me to take a look.


29
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,383 line:-2
Using the power
of screen sharing,


30
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,853 line:-2
I’m transported directly
to the experience,


31
00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:28.021 line:-2 align:center
and I can tell her exactly
what I think of the house


32
00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.024 line:-2 align:center
she's interested in while we’re
on a FaceTime call.


33
00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:33.327 line:-2 align:center
The key here
is that these activities


34
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.330 line:-2 align:center
are all things people love
to do together.


35
00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:38.665 line:-2 align:center
Before SharePlay,
you’ve probably designed


36
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,201 line:-2
and built your app
around a single person.


37
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:44,905 line:-2
All these examples are things
people love to do together.


38
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,074 line:-2
You should look for activities
in your app


39
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.043 line:-2 align:center
to bring people together,
encourage conversation,


40
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,480 line:-2
collaboration,
or just enjoyment.


41
00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:57.117 line:-2 align:center
As we noted, first you’ll want
to discover the activities


42
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,587 line:-2
in your app best suited
to sharing on a FaceTime call.


43
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:03.123 line:-2 align:center
Once you identify
these experiences,


44
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,393 line:-2
next you want to enhance them
for sharing,


45
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,196 line:-2
add context to make
the experience meaningful


46
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,433 line:-2
to the participants in the call,
and automate the experience


47
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,003 line:-2
by adopting
Group Activities API.


48
00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:17.738 line:-2 align:center
This will make it easy
for people


49
00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:20.274 line:-1 align:center
to get into your experiences.


50
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,444 line:-2
Let’s talk about how
to enhance your app for sharing.


51
00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.814 line:-2 align:center
There are three tools
in Group Activity you can use


52
00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:29.316 line:-1 align:center
to bring people together.


53
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,320 line:-2
First is screen sharing,
second is shared media playback,


54
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,857 line:-2
and finally, we’ll talk about
some custom UI techniques


55
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.295 line:-2 align:center
which can make your experience
fit well in Group Activities.


56
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,665 line:-2
While on a FaceTime call,
people can share their screen,


57
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,301 line:-2
and they can share
your app automatically.


58
00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:51.004 line:-2 align:center
This is a great way for people
to discover what to do together.


59
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:54,174 line:-2
When your app UI is shared,
it’s important to consider


60
00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:57.644 line:-2 align:center
which parts of your app
are relevant for sharing.


61
00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:01.281 line:-2 align:center
By default, everything is shared
except for secure entry fields.


62
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:05,252 line:-2
You can use UIKit API to further
restrict the visibility


63
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:09,656 line:-2
of this information on iOS
during screen sharing sessions.


64
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,192 line:-2
Your audio is also
shared automatically


65
00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:16.463 line:-2 align:center
with those on the call,
but protected content like music


66
00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:19.366 line:-2 align:center
and movies will not be
shared over screen sharing.


67
00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.835 line:-2 align:center
This is where you need
to implement Group Activities


68
00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:25.105 line:-2 align:center
to support
coordinated media playback.


69
00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:28.308 line:-2 align:center
This starts media on everyone’s
device at the same time


70
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,612 line:-2
and keeps them in sync
with rate changes and seeks.


71
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,681 line:-2
To be clear, this does not
stream media from device


72
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,151 line:-2
to device but synchronizes
playback on multiple devices.


73
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,455 line:-2
You get smart volume control
and the synchronization


74
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,291 line:-2
for free, but it is up
to you to decide what to do


75
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:48,529 line:-2
with seeking, rate changing,
playback controls, et cetera.


76
00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:52.599 line:-2 align:center
For more information, check out
the related session below.


77
00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:55.602 line:-2 align:center
IOS 15 supports
seamless upgrades


78
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,738 line:-2
from screen sharing
to media playback.


79
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,140 line:-2
Beginning SharePlay
automatically upgrades


80
00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:02.476 line:-2 align:center
the experience
to rich media content.


81
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,345 line:-2
What if your app doesn’t fall
into a media bucket?


82
00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.747 line:-1 align:center
No, problem.


83
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,716 line:-2
The Messenger protocol
allows you to broadcast data


84
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.853 line:-2 align:center
to all the other apps
on the call in near real time.


85
00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:15.355 line:-2 align:center
It’s private
and end-to-end encrypted


86
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,391 line:-1
just like the FaceTime call.


87
00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:21.061 line:-2 align:center
This makes it great
for driving apps with Custom UI.


88
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,298 line:-2
Custom UI is a great way to get
people together in your app.


89
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:26.667 line:-2 align:center
You can us this
to draw custom views,


90
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.736 line:-2 align:center
like the one that Adam has
drawn “Hello World” into.


91
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.438 line:-1 align:center
For more information on this,


92
00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.874 line:-2 align:center
check out
the related session below.


93
00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:37.144 line:-2 align:center
Now that you have evaluated
your app, its activities,


94
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,713 line:-2
and thought about ways it can be
enhanced for sharing,


95
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,482 line:-2
you might come up with new ideas
on activities


96
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,652 line:-2
which didn’t make sense
with a single person in mind.


97
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,522 line:-2
We are especially excited
about the opportunities here


98
00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:51.325 line:-2 align:center
where Group Activities inspires
a whole new kind of app


99
00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:53.360 line:-1 align:center
that brings people together.


100
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,763 line:-2
Here are some examples of how
SharePlay is used by Apple.


101
00:04:56.797 --> 00:05:00.100 line:-2 align:center
The TV app can be used
with screen sharing for people


102
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:04,705 line:-2
to discover their next favorite
TV show to binge watch together.


103
00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:08.041 line:-2 align:center
The Music app has been enhanced
to share your favorite new songs


104
00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:11.011 line:-2 align:center
and artists with your friends
on a FaceTime call.


105
00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:13.981 line:-2 align:center
Now that we have defined
our activities and looked


106
00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:17.184 line:-2 align:center
at some of the cool new shared
experiences Apple has defined,


107
00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:19.219 line:-2 align:center
we can come up
with great experiences


108
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,587 line:-1
to bring people together.


109
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:22.756 line:-2 align:center
The next concept I want
to talk about is how


110
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,158 line:-2
to make Group Activities
contextual.


111
00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:27.594 line:-2 align:center
Relating your app
and its content


112
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,163 line:-2
to the conversation is
a super helpful way


113
00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:33.467 line:-2 align:center
to make sure your app
is SharePlay ready.


114
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,335 line:-2
When someone first launches
your app


115
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,237 line:-2
while on a FaceTime call,
they’re shown


116
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:41.141 line:-2 align:center
if it supports SharePlay right
within the context of your app.


117
00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:43.544 line:-2 align:center
And if your app
contains video content,


118
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,079 line:-2
then you have an opportunity
to communicate to them


119
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,048 line:-2
that they can share that content
with the people


120
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.350 line:-1 align:center
who are on the FaceTime call.


121
00:05:50.384 --> 00:05:52.619 line:-2 align:center
Once they find the content
they want to watch,


122
00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:54.922 line:-2 align:center
they will simply tap
the SharePlay button,


123
00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:57.457 line:-1 align:center
and everyone’s show will start.


124
00:05:57.491 --> 00:05:59.660 line:-2 align:center
Once an app or content is
shared,


125
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,262 line:-2
activity preview tells
everyone else


126
00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:04.531 line:-2 align:center
about what you’re suggesting
they watch.


127
00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:06.767 line:-2 align:center
Activity previews
are an opportunity


128
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.204 line:-2 align:center
to give everyone context about
what they are about to watch,


129
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:13,674 line:-2
so it’s important that you use
this as best as possible.


130
00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:17.711 line:-2 align:center
Use it like a rich link,
with a title, subtitle,


131
00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.947 line:-2 align:center
and thumbnail
to describe the experience


132
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.584 line:-2 align:center
everyone is enjoying
on the FaceTime call.


133
00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:27.221 line:-2 align:center
Imagine receiving a message like
this with very little context.


134
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,356 line:-2
It’s important to make sure
that these titles


135
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.293 line:-2 align:center
and subtitles correspond
to the action in the call.


136
00:06:33.327 --> 00:06:35.996 line:-2 align:center
As you can see in this example,
it’s important


137
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,732 line:-2
to make these titles
and subtitles meaningful.


138
00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.400 line:-1 align:center
This is a great example of how


139
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,636 line:-2
to make
a meaningful activity preview.


140
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,839 line:-2
Remember that whenever someone
is interacting


141
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,407 line:-2
with their phone
during SharePlay,


142
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,877 line:-2
they are
essentially multitasking,


143
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,546 line:-2
so we need to make sure
the interaction is as easy


144
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,814 line:-1
as possible.


145
00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:55.616 line:-1 align:center
So automate as much as you can


146
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,018 line:-2
and minimize unneeded
upfront interaction


147
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,387 line:-2
before getting
into the activity.


148
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,223 line:-2
One way you can make
SharePlay super easy


149
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,859 line:-2
is to have your app auto launch
from the background


150
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,262 line:-2
on everyone’s device
automatically.


151
00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:10.998 line:-2 align:center
The way you do this is
by supporting Picture in Picture


152
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,499 line:-1
within your app.


153
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,234 line:-1
For more information on this,


154
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,870 line:-2
check out
related sessions below.


155
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,907 line:-2
Sometimes your app might
need some interaction,


156
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,443 line:-2
like to sign up or subscribe
for more content.


157
00:07:23.477 --> 00:07:27.247 line:-2 align:center
If that’s the case, simply call
the Group Activities API


158
00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.317 line:-2 align:center
and tell us that your app needs
foreground presentation.


159
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.818 line:-1 align:center
The user will tap the banner,


160
00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:33.654 line:-2 align:center
and your app will be brought
to the foreground,


161
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:37,291 line:-2
allowing the user to interact
before joining the experience.


162
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,961 line:-2
However, it’s important
to use this feature with care.


163
00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:43.230 line:-2 align:center
If someone doesn’t have
your app installed,


164
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,666 line:-2
when the activity begins
or they join the call,


165
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,067 line:-2
they’ll be taken
to the App Store


166
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.336 line:-2 align:center
to install it
when they tap the notice.


167
00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.206 line:-2 align:center
As you can see,
we’ve made it easy for people


168
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,373 line:-1
to get into your app.


169
00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:56.476 line:-2 align:center
You should streamline the path
into the activity.


170
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.646 line:-2 align:center
It’s important to remember
that any user interaction


171
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,615 line:-2
is happening on a FaceTime call,
so things


172
00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:04.251 line:-2 align:center
like account sign up,
purchases, et cetera,


173
00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:07.454 line:-2 align:center
all need to be done while also
chatting to your friends.


174
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.022 line:-2 align:center
Your friends
are going to be waiting


175
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,991 line:-2
for you
to complete this interaction.


176
00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:13.694 line:-2 align:center
The last thing your want to do
is make all of your friends wait


177
00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:15.896 line:-2 align:center
while you fill out
a lengthy form.


178
00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:20.067 line:-2 align:center
So question every interaction
and see if it’s really necessary


179
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,669 line:-2
to get to the content and,
if possible,


180
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,405 line:-2
delay
or automate those interactions.


181
00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:27.407 line:-1 align:center
Group Activities are a great way


182
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,042 line:-2
for people
to experience your app.


183
00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:31.778 line:-2 align:center
We are really excited
to see the types of activities


184
00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:33.780 line:-1 align:center
you will enhance for SharePlay.


185
00:08:33.814 --> 00:08:36.350 line:-2 align:center
And make sure
you’re adopting all the APIs


186
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,419 line:-2
to make the experience
effortless and seamless.


187
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,154 line:-1
