00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.044 line:-2 align:center
[Linda] Hi.
My name is Linda Dong.


5
00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:13.113 line:-2 align:center
I'm a Design Evangelist,
and I'm going to be


6
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,848 line:-1
joined shortly by Sam Iglesias,


7
00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:17.084 line:-2 align:center
a Prototyper
on the Apple Design Team.


8
00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.486 line:-2 align:center
We're gonna talk about
best practices when it comes


9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,622 line:-1
to designing inclusively.


10
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,790 line:-2
But before we get into that,
I wanted to touch


11
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,260 line:-1
on why we make apps and games.


12
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,562 line:-2
As a developer,
the things you create


13
00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:32.833 line:-2 align:center
bring people joy,
enrichment, and convenience.


14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:37,137 line:-2
They help us accomplish tasks
and reach personal goals.


15
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:40.741 line:-2 align:center
They connect us with other
people from around the world.


16
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,110 line:-2
They entertain us
through fun gameplay


17
00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:45.712 line:-2 align:center
or make us thoughtful
through touching narratives.


18
00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:48.482 line:-2 align:center
At the end of the day,
they add emotional


19
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,251 line:-2
and practical value
to our lives.


20
00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:53.153 line:-2 align:center
And I'm sure one of the goals
you have


21
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,823 line:-2
for your app or game is enabling
as many people as possible


22
00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:59.493 line:-1 align:center
to enjoy these benefits.


23
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,395 line:-2
Over the years,
the App Store has grown


24
00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:03.564 line:-1 align:center
into a huge marketplace


25
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:07,401 line:-2
that serves 500 million visitors
per week.


26
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:11,538 line:-2
People from over 175
regions around the world


27
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,440 line:-1
and 40 different languages


28
00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.210 line:-2 align:center
can potentially see
what you've built.


29
00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:19.546 line:-2 align:center
If you want to reach even
a fraction of that audience,


30
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,550 line:-2
you owe it to yourself to design
with inclusivity in mind,


31
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:27.087 line:-2 align:center
so that your app or game
is great for everyone.


32
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.958 line:-2 align:center
This means that people can
interact with your design


33
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.294 line:-2 align:center
through different languages
and accessibility features.


34
00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:36.797 line:-2 align:center
That it's easy to learn,
feels natural,


35
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.999 line:-1 align:center
and is a pleasure to use.


36
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,436 line:-2
But great usability isn't
the only important goal.


37
00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.572 line:-2 align:center
What also matters is
that your app or game is


38
00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:48.008 line:-2 align:center
welcoming and respectful
of folks


39
00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.645 line:-2 align:center
from diverse backgrounds
and perspectives.


40
00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:54.948 line:-2 align:center
Our perspectives are shaped
by a number of factors,


41
00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:57.985 line:-2 align:center
such as our individual
experiences.


42
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,720 line:0
This could be where
we grew up in the world


43
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,955 line:0
and where we live now,


44
00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:05.125 line:-2 align:center
the cultures
we're familiar with,


45
00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:08.228 line:-2 align:center
and the languages we speak
or hear around us.


46
00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:11.265 line:-2 align:center
They're also shaped
by our human characteristics,


47
00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:15.702 line:-2 align:center
like our gender, our age,
and the physical and mental


48
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:19,106 line:-2
abilities and disabilities
we might have.


49
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,141 line:-2
You can think of each
of these factors


50
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:24,745 line:-2
as its own diversity axis,
and the intersection of where


51
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:29,850 line:-2
someone lands on all these axes
makes up their unique identity.


52
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,352 line:-2
It's a good reminder
to think critically about


53
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,088 line:-2
how people with completely
different identities


54
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:39,259 line:-2
and perspectives will all be
able to enjoy what you've built.


55
00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:41.562 line:-2 align:center
When someone approaches
your app or game,


56
00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:44.464 line:-2 align:center
they should feel like
you designed with them in mind.


57
00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:47.768 line:-2 align:center
Not only will people feel taken
care of, you'll build trust


58
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:52,039 line:-2
that extends to other areas
of your app, game, and brand.


59
00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:53.540 line:-2 align:center
One of the great things
about being


60
00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.943 line:-2 align:center
in your position is
that you're in charge


61
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,379 line:-2
of how accommodating
your designs will be for people.


62
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,382 line:-2
It does take
work and consideration,


63
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,618 line:-2
and you're not always
gonna get it right,


64
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,687 line:-2
but any intentional steps
you take


65
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.989 line:-2 align:center
will be appreciated
by so many people.


66
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,627 line:-2
To help, we're gonna talk about
how to approach designing


67
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.031 line:-2 align:center
inclusively, especially
in the area of content.


68
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:21,368 line:-2
At Apple, we define
"content" as the words,


69
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,105 line:-2
images, audio,
and video that live


70
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,242 line:-2
inside your designs,
as well as your marketing.


71
00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:31.945 line:-2 align:center
Content is the language you use
to speak to your audience.


72
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,215 line:-2
And it's also how you let
folks identify themselves.


73
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:38,252 line:-2
This can be through the names,
profile details,


74
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,988 line:-2
avatars, or characters
that people can customize


75
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:42.789 line:-1 align:center
within your app or game.


76
00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:45.492 line:-2 align:center
The way you address people
through your content


77
00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:47.961 line:-2 align:center
and how you let folks
represent themselves


78
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:51,598 line:-2
are great moments where you can
make more people feel welcome.


79
00:03:51.632 --> 00:03:53.567 line:-2 align:center
So with that,
I'll hand it over to Sam


80
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.535 line:-1 align:center
to get us started.


81
00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:56.103 line:-1 align:center
[Sam] Thanks, Linda.


82
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,772 line:-2
In this video, we'll go through
six specific practices


83
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,276 line:-2
you can use to make
your app or game more inclusive.


84
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,079 line:-1
Tell diverse stories.


85
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,315 line:-1
Avoid stereotypes.


86
00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.551 line:-1 align:center
Adopt accessibility.


87
00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.986 line:-1 align:center
Localize for culture.


88
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.389 line:-1 align:center
Use color mindfully.


89
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,392 line:-2
And finally,
encourage self-expression.


90
00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.295 line:-2 align:center
The first practice is
tell diverse stories.


91
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,996 line:-2
As Linda mentioned,
people who might use


92
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.432 line:-2 align:center
your app or game will come
from a rich and diverse set


93
00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:28.101 line:-2 align:center
of individual backgrounds
and experiences.


94
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,838 line:-2
You have an opportunity
to make them feel included,


95
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:33.040 line:-2 align:center
even before
they've downloaded it.


96
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,342 line:-2
This could be through something
like a web page


97
00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:38.245 line:-2 align:center
or your app's page
on the App Store.


98
00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:41.815 line:-2 align:center
The way you describe
your app or game, its name,


99
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,885 line:-2
video trailer, and even
the screenshots you select


100
00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:47.120 line:-2 align:center
tell a story
about whom it was built for


101
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,089 line:-1
and how they might use it.


102
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.058 line:-2 align:center
If you don't approach
this step with creativity


103
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,260 line:-2
and empathy,
you might unintentionally make


104
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,163 line:-2
some potential customers
of yours feel unwelcome.


105
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,532 line:-1
Let's focus on app screenshots.


106
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,300 line:-2
You might start with names
that are familiar


107
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,170 line:-2
from your immediate circle
of family and friends.


108
00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:04.805 line:-2 align:center
Or depict
hobbies and discussions


109
00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:07.674 line:-2 align:center
that personally interest
or excite you.


110
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,942 line:-1
Or draw on familiar stories


111
00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:11.612 line:-2 align:center
for your app's
example scenarios.


112
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,981 line:-2
For example, your app might be
social in nature,


113
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,048 line:-2
and you're gonna be
making choices


114
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,483 line:-2
about what kinds
of content shows up


115
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,186 line:-2
in the example feed,
who's posting that content,


116
00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.687 line:-2 align:center
and even the tenor
of interaction


117
00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:22.756 line:-1 align:center
among people who use your app.


118
00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.424 line:-2 align:center
Or it might be something
like a to-do list,


119
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,827 line:-2
and you're gonna be making
choices about a day in the life


120
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.428 line:-1 align:center
of somebody using your app:


121
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,831 line:-2
the activity or celebration
they might be planning,


122
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:34,601 line:-2
their reading list,
their aspirations.


123
00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:36.370 line:-2 align:center
Or it might be
a food-tracking app,


124
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,372 line:-2
and you're showing examples
of the kinds of foods someone


125
00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.874 line:-2 align:center
could be interested in logging,
or the kinds of food choices


126
00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:43.243 line:-2 align:center
they'll be making
throughout their day.


127
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,778 line:-2
These are excellent
opportunities


128
00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:47.414 line:-2 align:center
to tell interesting
and diverse stories.


129
00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:49.183 line:-2 align:center
In my social app,
I might wanna depict


130
00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:51.685 line:-2 align:center
a group of people having
fun on a kayaking trip.


131
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,520 line:-2
While this definitely
looks like a lot of fun,


132
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,722 line:-2
this group might not necessarily
reflect the diversity


133
00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:57.991 line:-2 align:center
of people who might be
interested in my app,


134
00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:00.527 line:-2 align:center
or a lifestyle that everyone can
relate to.


135
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,262 line:-2
There are a number of ways
this might be improved.


136
00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:06.133 line:-2 align:center
Here's an example of a set
of changes we could make.


137
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,935 line:-2
Now, we have a photo
that depicts a slightly


138
00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:09.670 line:-2 align:center
more diverse group
of people performing


139
00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:10.938 line:-1 align:center
an act of community service.


140
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,241 line:-2
In our example to-do app,
we might depict


141
00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:16.610 line:-2 align:center
a fairly pedestrian day
for some Americans,


142
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:19,346 line:-2
where we're returning a call
to our best friend,


143
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.014 line:-2 align:center
then shopping
for a birthday party,


144
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,951 line:-2
reading a book, and then
practicing an instrument.


145
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,654 line:-2
But the problem is these are,
at least to some audiences,


146
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,791 line:-2
kind of overly familiar
cliches, right?


147
00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:33.527 line:-2 align:center
Here's how this example
might be improved.


148
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,429 line:-2
Instead of returning
John's call,


149
00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:37.798 line:-1 align:center
now I'm returning Abhi's call.


150
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,534 line:-2
Instead of shopping for dinner,
I'm planning Diwali,


151
00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.937 line:-2 align:center
a holiday that's observed
by over a billion people.


152
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:48,141 line:-2
For a book, maybe a lesser-known
voice, like Chinua Achebe's?


153
00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:50.811 line:-2 align:center
As for an activity to practice,
how about sign language,


154
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,514 line:-2
which can promote inclusion
of the deaf community?


155
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,783 line:-2
While still telling
the story of someone


156
00:06:56.817 --> 00:06:59.219 line:-2 align:center
who needs an app to keep
track of various tasks,


157
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,256 line:-2
we've made some of the content
more relatable and inclusive


158
00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.525 line:-2 align:center
to more people along
different diversity axes.


159
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,895 line:-2
How about something like
a food-logging app?


160
00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:09.630 line:-2 align:center
It's probably really tempting,
when putting


161
00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:12.032 line:-2 align:center
screenshots together,
to reach for what's familiar.


162
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,968 line:-2
So if you're American,
examples like these--pancakes,


163
00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:18.138 line:-2 align:center
pizza, hamburgers--might
make you feel right at home.


164
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:20,374 line:-2
But let's remember that not
everyone around the world,


165
00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:23.076 line:-2 align:center
or even in the United States,
imagines a screen like this


166
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.645 line:-2 align:center
when they're thinking
about food.


167
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,613 line:-2
Adding some foods that might
speak to other cultures


168
00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:28.482 line:-2 align:center
could be an excellent way
to tell


169
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,185 line:-2
a slightly different story,
not just about how someone


170
00:07:31.218 --> 00:07:34.821 line:-2 align:center
might use your app,
but whom your app is for.


171
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,991 line:-2
So when you're setting up
your App Store page,


172
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,660 line:-1
tell diverse stories.


173
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,329 line:-2
Fill your screenshots
not with the names and scenarios


174
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,499 line:-2
that come to mind the quickest,
but try to dig a little deeper,


175
00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:48.402 line:-2 align:center
to find a story
that's told less often.


176
00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:50.637 line:-2 align:center
Not only will this make new
groups of people feel welcomed


177
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,774 line:-2
by your app or game, it'll help
it stand out even more.


178
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:57.845 line:-2 align:center
[Linda] The second practice
for designing inclusively


179
00:07:57.878 --> 00:08:00.280 line:-1 align:center
is to avoid stereotypes.


180
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,749 line:-2
Stereotypes are
oversimplified beliefs


181
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,885 line:-1
about communities of people.


182
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,121 line:-2
They make you overlook
differences between individuals


183
00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:12.059 line:-2 align:center
and perpetuate incorrect ideas
of how people behave.


184
00:08:12.092 --> 00:08:15.395 line:-2 align:center
The truth is all of us hold
these types of beliefs,


185
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,965 line:-2
and, usually, we're not
even aware we have them.


186
00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:21.668 line:-2 align:center
But if you aren't careful of how
stereotypes influence the design


187
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,538 line:-2
of your app or game,
you may be unconsciously


188
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,040 line:-2
excluding people,
by not recognizing them


189
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,743 line:-2
in your content
and functionality.


190
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,979 line:-2
For example,
in your language and visuals,


191
00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:35.115 line:-2 align:center
it's sometimes easy to fall
into the stereotype that people


192
00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:40.020 line:-2 align:center
are divided into just
two genders, men and women.


193
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,991 line:-2
This binary is deeply embedded
in some languages and cultures,


194
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,759 line:-2
and if you're part
of those communities,


195
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,761 line:-1
you can unknowingly overlook


196
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,330 line:-2
millions of people
who don't identify with either.


197
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,200 line:-2
Throughout history,
people have recognized


198
00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:56.003 line:-2 align:center
a spectrum of human gender,
and you can


199
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,740 line:-2
honor this diversity by avoiding
unnecessary references


200
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:03,010 line:-2
to a gender binary
in your content.


201
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,779 line:-2
For example, when you don't know
someone's gender,


202
00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:08.382 line:-2 align:center
instead of using
the binary pronouns "he"


203
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:12,219 line:-2
or "she" in your copy,
you can replace this language


204
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,122 line:-2
with the gender-neutral pronoun
"they" instead.


205
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,193 line:-2
You can also avoid overlooking
parts of your audience


206
00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:22.429 line:-2 align:center
by referring to people
as a single gender.


207
00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:23.830 line:-1 align:center
Like saying "Hey, guys!"


208
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,366 line:-2
in video content,
when you can include


209
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.802 line:-2 align:center
more people by saying
"Hey, everyone!"


210
00:09:30.504 --> 00:09:33.173 line:-2 align:center
Removing unnecessary
gender references


211
00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:35.242 line:-1 align:center
also applies to visuals.


212
00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:39.513 line:-2 align:center
Take, for example, a placeholder
icon for someone's new profile


213
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:43,150 line:-2
that uses a stereotypical
masculine avatar.


214
00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:45.886 line:-2 align:center
This icon tells a story
about who you think


215
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.889 line:-2 align:center
your app is for
and maintains a message


216
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,392 line:-2
that a generic person
means a masculine person.


217
00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:55.095 line:-1 align:center
Let's make this better,


218
00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:58.332 line:-2 align:center
by using a non-gendered
human icon that doesn't


219
00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:00.767 line:-2 align:center
make any assumptions
about who a person is.


220
00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:05.672 line:-2 align:center
SFSymbols provides a number
of these gender-neutral glyphs


221
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,442 line:-2
you can use throughout
your apps and games.


222
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,078 line:-2
Just as you don't want your app
or game to disregard


223
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.613 line:-1 align:center
people through gender,


224
00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:14.448 line:-2 align:center
you also don't want
to exclude people


225
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:17.251 line:-2 align:center
by unintentionally using
ableist language.


226
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,787 line:-2
If you're not familiar
with the term "ableism,"


227
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,724 line:-2
it's a stereotype that having
a certain set of physical


228
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,527 line:-2
or mental abilities
makes you "normal"


229
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,929 line:-2
and having disabilities
makes you "abnormal."


230
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.200 line:-2 align:center
But we all know that there's
no such thing as normal.


231
00:10:33.233 --> 00:10:35.536 line:-2 align:center
Everyone has
a unique set of abilities,


232
00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:37.337 line:-1 align:center
some people have disabilities,


233
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:40,507 line:-2
and everyone's capabilities
are equally valuable.


234
00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:45.012 line:-2 align:center
Like gender, ableist language
can be deeply embedded


235
00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:49.082 line:-2 align:center
in the way that we talk
and can slip into your copy.


236
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:52,920 line:-2
Like using words that reference
disabilities, such as "insane"


237
00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:57.224 line:-2 align:center
or "crazy," to describe
something that's undesirable.


238
00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:59.026 line:-2 align:center
Even if you're trying to use
that word


239
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,727 line:-2
to describe something
positively,


240
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,497 line:-2
like "Achieve
insanely fast speeds,"


241
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.366 line:-2 align:center
it's still labeling
a condition as an outlier,


242
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,936 line:-2
which can stigmatize
mental health.


243
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,405 line:-2
In cases like this,
you can rethink


244
00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.173 line:-2 align:center
how you can convey
the same meaning


245
00:11:13.207 --> 00:11:16.977 line:-2 align:center
without casting disabilities in
a negative or alienating light.


246
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,882 line:-2
Here, instead of saying
"Achieve insanely fast speeds,"


247
00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:24.918 line:-2 align:center
you could say "Achieve
ridiculously fast speeds."


248
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,189 line:-2
Now, all of this isn't to say
that you should completely


249
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:32,125 line:-2
avoid acknowledging
disability in your content,


250
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,628 line:-2
but rather to avoid
referring to disability


251
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:38,866 line:-2
in language when suggesting
something is less than.


252
00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:41.602 line:-2 align:center
In fact,
it's a great idea to recognize


253
00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:44.238 line:-2 align:center
and reinforce representation
of disabilities.


254
00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:47.007 line:-2 align:center
Showing people with disabilities
in your emoji,


255
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.110 line:-2 align:center
photography,
and game characters can help


256
00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:54.481 line:-2 align:center
debunk stereotypes of who uses
and plays apps and games.


257
00:11:54.515 --> 00:11:57.551 line:-2 align:center
Outside of content,
avoid letting stereotypes


258
00:11:57.584 --> 00:12:00.487 line:-2 align:center
limit your interface's
functionality.


259
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:03.090 line:-2 align:center
Let's say I'm designing
an app that lets families


260
00:12:03.123 --> 00:12:06.827 line:-2 align:center
manage who has access
to a shared movie library.


261
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.697 line:-2 align:center
If I have a stereotypical view
of what a family looks like,


262
00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:14.568 line:-2 align:center
perhaps a married man
and woman and young children,


263
00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:17.804 line:-2 align:center
I might end up designing
an interface like this.


264
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:21,041 line:-2
Which buckets
family members into a father,


265
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,077 line:-1
a mother, and child roles.


266
00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:26.246 line:-2 align:center
In this case,
my app's understanding


267
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,449 line:-2
of what a family is doesn't
consider that families can look


268
00:12:29.483 --> 00:12:33.387 line:-2 align:center
like single parents,
same-sex parents,


269
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.856 line:-1 align:center
multi-generational households,


270
00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:39.560 line:-2 align:center
adult children,
and legal guardians.


271
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,196 line:-2
Whether I planned it or not,
my app's design


272
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:46,066 line:-2
and functionality excludes all
those families who are different


273
00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:50.838 line:-2 align:center
from the stereotype from being
able to this interface.


274
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,540 line:-2
So how could I improve
this feature?


275
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:57,177 line:-2
Well, instead of assuming
there are fixed family roles,


276
00:12:57.211 --> 00:12:59.680 line:-2 align:center
I can label each profile
something neutral,


277
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,082 line:-1
like "family member."


278
00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:05.185 line:-2 align:center
And instead of assuming how many
people make up a family,


279
00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:08.422 line:-2 align:center
I can start with just the person
setting up the account,


280
00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:12.192 line:-2 align:center
and let them add as many people
to their family as they need.


281
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:14,928 line:-2
For you,
not making assumptions about


282
00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:17.731 line:-2 align:center
who is using your app
can enable you to build


283
00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:20.200 line:-2 align:center
functionality that supports
everyone.


284
00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:22.436 line:-2 align:center
The best way to develop
your awareness


285
00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:23.971 line:-1 align:center
of your own stereotypes


286
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:27,674 line:-2
is to talk to people from beyond
your immediate community.


287
00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:31.745 line:-2 align:center
Look for people with a diversity
of lived experiences that can


288
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,983 line:-2
help you recognize where
your knowledge falls short.


289
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,419 line:-2
And remember that language is
constantly evolving,


290
00:13:39.453 --> 00:13:42.055 line:-2 align:center
and that this guidance
will change over time,


291
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,592 line:-2
so be open to updating your
knowledge as definitions shift.


292
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,830 line:-2
[Sam] In our third practice,
we'll discuss why it's important


293
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:53,734 line:-2
to try to adopt accessibility
in your app or game.


294
00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:56.303 line:-2 align:center
Imagine someone who is
blind has just downloaded


295
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,273 line:-2
your app,
is extremely excited to try it,


296
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,108 line:-2
and is greeted with this
from VoiceOver.


297
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:04,778 line:-2
[text to speech]
Button, gear shape two.


298
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,747 line:-2
[Sam] Or someone who is deaf
has made it


299
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,282 line:-2
through an exciting level
in your game


300
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:12,619 line:-2
to a cutscene,
and captions aren't offered.


301
00:14:12.653 --> 00:14:14.855 line:-2 align:center
Linda told you earlier
about ableism,


302
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,724 line:-2
which stems from the idea
that somebody who is disabled is


303
00:14:17.758 --> 00:14:20.460 line:-2 align:center
"abnormal" and should not
receive the same attention


304
00:14:20.494 --> 00:14:22.763 line:-1 align:center
of those who are "normal."


305
00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:26.133 line:-2 align:center
If your app or game's content
isn't as accessible as possible,


306
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,035 line:-1
it is not inclusive.


307
00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:30.204 line:-2 align:center
Do not start with the assumption
that someone who is


308
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,207 line:-2
disabled wouldn't want
to use your app or game.


309
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,576 line:-2
Let's look at some ways you can
make it benefit more people.


310
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.380 line:-2 align:center
The world is a rich tapestry
of experiences and abilities.


311
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:43,217 line:-2
From those who are blind
or have low vision,


312
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,254 line:-2
are deaf or hard-of-hearing,
have sensitivity to motion,


313
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,690 line:-2
or physical
or motor disabilities,


314
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,391 line:-1
hundreds of millions of people


315
00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:53.927 line:-2 align:center
use at least one
accessibility setting.


316
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:56.930 line:-2 align:center
And even if you or anybody
you know doesn't use one,


317
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:59,867 line:-2
it's possible that at some point
in your life, you might find


318
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,370 line:-2
Accessibility helpful,
even if temporarily.


319
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,240 line:-2
This can be something temporary
like having your pupils dilated


320
00:15:06.273 --> 00:15:10.110 line:-2 align:center
at the optometrist and needing
larger text, or needing


321
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,780 line:-2
to reduce exposure to loud
sounds after a concussion,


322
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:16,817 line:-2
or it might be some other
health circumstance.


323
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.685 line:-2 align:center
So what are some things
you can do to ensure


324
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,220 line:-1
that your app is accessible?


325
00:15:20.254 --> 00:15:22.022 line:-2 align:center
Let's have a look
at a few things you can do,


326
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,424 line:-1
starting with text and type.


327
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,293 line:-1
Visual perception varies a lot.


328
00:15:26.326 --> 00:15:27.528 line:-2 align:center
That's why it's important
to make sure


329
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:30.097 line:-2 align:center
that your app functions
properly across the range


330
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,332 line:-1
of Dynamic Type settings.


331
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,935 line:-2
iOS supports a wide range
of text size preferences,


332
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,871 line:-2
but by using the right
layout APIs in SwiftUI


333
00:15:37.905 --> 00:15:39.907 line:-2 align:center
or UIKit,
your app's layout should


334
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,544 line:-2
be able to adapt flexibly
and automatically.


335
00:15:43.577 --> 00:15:45.312 line:-2 align:center
Here's an example of how
a To-Do app using


336
00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:48.882 line:-2 align:center
SwiftUI's font system
adapts automatically.


337
00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:51.051 line:-2 align:center
Try to take care
that your app is intelligible


338
00:15:51.084 --> 00:15:52.586 line:-1 align:center
across the type size gamut.


339
00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.721 line:-2 align:center
Look for truncated
and clipped text,


340
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,857 line:-2
and maybe rethink
some of your layouts


341
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.726 line:-2 align:center
if they have trouble
with the larger sizes.


342
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,296 line:-2
Additionally, you wanna
make sure that your app


343
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,898 line:-2
consistently honors some
of the settings that UIKit's


344
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:09,102 line:-2
or SwiftUI's text system doesn't
handle for you automatically.


345
00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:11.305 line:-2 align:center
For example,
if the person using your app has


346
00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:13.640 line:-2 align:center
Bold Text turned on,
make sure that elements


347
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:15,742 line:-2
that are not text,
but which still might pose


348
00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:18.579 line:-2 align:center
legibility challenges,
are thickened.


349
00:16:18.612 --> 00:16:20.414 line:-1 align:center
These circles, for example.


350
00:16:20.447 --> 00:16:22.916 line:-2 align:center
Here's what the app looks like
with bold text turned on,


351
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,685 line:-1
but we aren't done yet.


352
00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:27.387 line:-2 align:center
We need to go further and have
some of our other interface


353
00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:30.390 line:-2 align:center
elements respond to this new,
bolder preference.


354
00:16:30.424 --> 00:16:31.658 line:-1 align:center
That's better.


355
00:16:31.692 --> 00:16:34.094 line:-1 align:center
Now, let's talk about VoiceOver.


356
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,663 line:-2
VoiceOver is a screen reader
that lets people use


357
00:16:36.697 --> 00:16:38.732 line:-2 align:center
an interface without
looking at the screen.


358
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,367 line:-1
For someone who is blind,


359
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.836 line:-2 align:center
VoiceOver is
absolutely critical,


360
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.305 line:-2 align:center
but VoiceOver also benefits
people who have other reasons


361
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,140 line:-2
not to look at a screen,
such as someone who's riding


362
00:16:47.174 --> 00:16:50.911 line:-2 align:center
a bus, who might be motion sick
if they look at their device.


363
00:16:50.944 --> 00:16:53.714 line:-2 align:center
By default, VoiceOver attempts
to step over interface elements


364
00:16:53.747 --> 00:16:56.049 line:-2 align:center
in a logical order
and will glean information


365
00:16:56.083 --> 00:16:57.951 line:-2 align:center
embedded
in system-standard controls.


366
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,754 line:-2
However, there will be cases
in which VoiceOver


367
00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:01.688 line:-1 align:center
needs more help.


368
00:17:02.723 --> 00:17:04.358 line:-2 align:center
The first case is where
a button is simply


369
00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:06.560 line:-1 align:center
represented by a glyph.


370
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,196 line:-2
If you use a glyph from
SFSymbols, VoiceOver will use


371
00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:12.065 line:-2 align:center
the symbol's name, but even
a description of the glyph might


372
00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.468 line:-2 align:center
not be enough to convey
the button's functionality.


373
00:17:14.501 --> 00:17:16.670 line:-2 align:center
[text to speech]
Gear shape two, button.


374
00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.805 line:-2 align:center
[Sam] Whether you're using
SwiftUI or UIKit,


375
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,973 line:-1
take care to add a descriptor


376
00:17:20.007 --> 00:17:22.676 line:-2 align:center
that makes more sense
in your app's context.


377
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,845 line:-2
You want VoiceOver to read
this button out to say


378
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:25,946 line:-1
something like this.


379
00:17:25.979 --> 00:17:28.482 line:-2 align:center
[text to speech]
Account settings, button.


380
00:17:28.515 --> 00:17:31.185 line:-2 align:center
[Sam] Or this, where the button
is also reflecting some state.


381
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,353 line:-2
[text to speech]
Remove favorite, button.


382
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,088 line:-2
[Sam] The second important note
is to pay attention


383
00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:36.223 line:-1 align:center
to VoiceOver's ordering.


384
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,659 align:center
This app features a prominent
"post" button at the bottom


385
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:42,029 align:center
of the screen, placed there
so it can be easily accessed.


386
00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:43.564 line:-2 align:center
But VoiceOver
will probably start


387
00:17:43.597 --> 00:17:46.967 line:-2 align:center
reading out interface
elements on the top left.


388
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,703 align:center
Fortunately,
SwiftUI and UIKit make it easy


389
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,773 line:0
to specify that the "post"
button should be read out first.


390
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,842 line:0
[text to speech]
Make new post, button.


391
00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:56.543 line:-2 align:center
[Sam] And the top left
will be read second.


392
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:57,611 line:-2
[text to speech]
Profile picture.


393
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:58,779 line:-1
Hi there, Enrique!


394
00:17:58.812 --> 00:18:00.948 line:-1 align:center
Venice, CA, 68 degrees.


395
00:18:02.616 --> 00:18:05.052 line:-2 align:center
[Sam] You've probably gathered
by now that testing is critical.


396
00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.155 line:-2 align:center
While it's never possible
to have complete access


397
00:18:08.188 --> 00:18:10.724 line:-2 align:center
to someone's lived experience,
try your app or game


398
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,659 line:-2
with some of these Accessibility
settings turned on.


399
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:15,596 line:-2
You can add a number
of accessibility settings,


400
00:18:15.629 --> 00:18:19.666 line:-2 align:center
like VoiceOver, Increase
Contrast, Reduce Transparency,


401
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.469 line:-2 align:center
Reduce Motion,
and the Grayscale Color Filter


402
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:24,371 line:-2
into your Accessibility Shortcut
menu


403
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,974 line:-2
and access it
from Control Center.


404
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:29,810 line:-2
Another really handy feature
is the Text Size toggle,


405
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,412 line:-2
which can also be added
to Control Center.


406
00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:34.381 line:-2 align:center
Try experiencing your app
or game in grayscale


407
00:18:34.414 --> 00:18:36.650 line:-2 align:center
to get a sense for how
reliant you are on color


408
00:18:36.683 --> 00:18:39.119 line:-2 align:center
and how strong your app's
color contrast is.


409
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,722 line:-2
Try experiencing your app
or game with no sound,


410
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:45,192 line:-2
to get a sense for how reliant
your app is on audio alone.


411
00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:46.527 line:-1 align:center
Taking a different perspective


412
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,595 line:-2
on how your app or game
might be used


413
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,964 line:-2
can actually lead
to some insights and innovations


414
00:18:50.998 --> 00:18:53.433 line:-2 align:center
that can make the experience
better for everyone.


415
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,670 line:-2
One of my favorite examples
is the QuickPath Swipe Keyboard,


416
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,172 line:-1
which was originally invented


417
00:18:58.205 --> 00:18:59.740 line:-2 align:center
to help those who lack
the manual dexterity


418
00:18:59.773 --> 00:19:02.776 line:-2 align:center
to thumbtype type as quickly
as everyone else.


419
00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:05.779 line:-2 align:center
As it happens, many people
love typing in this way.


420
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,115 line:-2
A solution to a challenge
for one group of people


421
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,751 line:-2
ended up helping
many, many more.


422
00:19:10.784 --> 00:19:12.286 line:-2 align:center
We didn't touch on all
the ways you can make


423
00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:15.289 line:-2 align:center
your interface more accessible,
but be very conscious about


424
00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:18.125 line:-2 align:center
who can use your app or game,
and try really hard to widen


425
00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:20.961 line:-2 align:center
the circle so that even more
people can enjoy your work.


426
00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:24.264 line:-2 align:center
[Linda] Our fourth practice
for designing inclusively


427
00:19:24.298 --> 00:19:26.934 line:-1 align:center
is localizing for culture.


428
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,636 line:-2
A big step in growing
your app or game's reach


429
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.105 line:-2 align:center
is translating it
into different languages


430
00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:34.107 line:-1 align:center
so more people can enjoy it.


431
00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:36.143 line:-2 align:center
Even if you're not
looking to expand


432
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,978 line:-1
into other countries just yet,


433
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:40.681 line:-2 align:center
remember that the people
who live in your country speak


434
00:19:40.714 --> 00:19:43.550 line:-2 align:center
different and, sometimes,
multiple languages.


435
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:46,420 align:center
In fact, it's estimated
that roughly half


436
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:50,657 line:0
the people in the world
speak more than one language.


437
00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:53.527 line:-2 align:center
Translation is all about
prepping your interface


438
00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.362 line:-2 align:center
so that it can handle
different word lengths


439
00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:57.464 line:-1 align:center
and writing systems.


440
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:00,501 align:center
It also involves
carefully dubbing any audio


441
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:04,471 line:0
and translating
closed captioning in video.


442
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:07,508 line:-2
As well as paying attention
to how you format units,


443
00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:11.211 line:-2 align:center
such as time, phone numbers,
and currency.


444
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,682 line:-2
But localization isn't
just about translating words


445
00:20:15.716 --> 00:20:18.752 line:-2 align:center
and numbers from one
language to another.


446
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,454 line:-2
It's also about
making your content


447
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,890 line:-2
more relevant
to different cultures.


448
00:20:22.923 --> 00:20:25.926 line:-2 align:center
And again, this matters
even if you're only focused


449
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,695 line:-2
on the country you're based in
because those folks


450
00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:31.798 line:-2 align:center
around you still come from
different cultural backgrounds.


451
00:20:31.832 --> 00:20:34.501 line:-2 align:center
One of the first things
you can do to make people


452
00:20:34.535 --> 00:20:38.272 line:-2 align:center
from other cultures feel welcome
is to double-check whether


453
00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:41.308 line:-2 align:center
you're using phrases that only
make sense to certain people.


454
00:20:42.643 --> 00:20:46.413 line:-2 align:center
Take this phrase:
"Nine cows and one hair."


455
00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:48.415 line:-2 align:center
If you're not familiar
with Chinese expressions,


456
00:20:48.448 --> 00:20:51.418 line:-2 align:center
you're probably wondering,
"What the heck does this mean?"


457
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:54,788 line:-2
This expression is an idiom,
which is a phrase that has


458
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,891 line:-2
a different meaning
than its literal words.


459
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:00,861 line:-2
If I were to convert this
into an English idiom,


460
00:21:00.894 --> 00:21:04.565 line:-2 align:center
you might recognize it
as "a drop in the bucket,"


461
00:21:04.598 --> 00:21:08.268 line:-2 align:center
which, in turn, means
"a tiny amount."


462
00:21:08.302 --> 00:21:09.937 line:-1 align:center
Language like idioms,


463
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,141 line:-2
and slang, and humor,
can be tricky to make inclusive.


464
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,176 line:-2
Not only do they take
a lot of steps


465
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.879 line:-2 align:center
in your head to understand,
people need to share


466
00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:22.216 line:-2 align:center
the same cultural background
in order to get them.


467
00:21:22.249 --> 00:21:24.885 line:-2 align:center
And sometimes, they don't have
a direct translation.


468
00:21:26.386 --> 00:21:29.256 line:-2 align:center
Imagine if your app's copy
said something like


469
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,959 line:-2
"Plan your vacation
from A to Z."


470
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:34,394 line:-2
How would you translate
"A to Z," to make sense


471
00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:36.663 line:-1 align:center
in, say, Korean?


472
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:40,801 line:-2
Always try to speak with plain,
direct language,


473
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:43,937 line:-2
avoiding metaphors
and complex terms.


474
00:21:43.971 --> 00:21:46.306 line:-2 align:center
It will make your copy
easier to understand,


475
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,077 line:-2
easier to translate,
and more culturally inclusive.


476
00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:55.449 line:-2 align:center
In this case, I would rephrase
"Plan your vacation from A to Z"


477
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:59,119 line:-2
plainly as "Plan your vacation
from beginning to end."


478
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:03,457 line:-2
To dive deeper into clear
language that's understandable


479
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,294 line:-2
to everyone, check out the new
section on "Writing Inclusively"


480
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,063 line:-2
in the Apple Style Guide
website.


481
00:22:10,097 --> 00:22:12,966 line:-2
Beyond words, it's good
to consider whether your content


482
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,069 line:-2
is respectful of different
cultural norms and customs.


483
00:22:17.271 --> 00:22:20.307 line:-2 align:center
Say I've just launched a cooking
app in the United States,


484
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.076 line:-2 align:center
which compiles recipes
for popular meals


485
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,880 line:-2
like homemade pizza,
roast chicken, and hot dogs.


486
00:22:26.914 --> 00:22:29.416 line:-2 align:center
My app is doing really well,
and I'd like to expand


487
00:22:29.449 --> 00:22:32.186 line:-2 align:center
into international markets,
starting with India.


488
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,489 line:-2
I might work closely
with a translator


489
00:22:35.522 --> 00:22:38.425 line:-2 align:center
to get my screens written
into the language Hindi,


490
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,094 line:-1
which would look like this.


491
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:44,932 line:-2
If I stopped there and just
launched my app in India as-is,


492
00:22:44.965 --> 00:22:47.534 line:-2 align:center
it would probably flop
in that market.


493
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:48,402 line:-1
Why?


494
00:22:48.435 --> 00:22:50.370 line:-2 align:center
Because even though
people in India would


495
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:53,207 line:-2
be able to read
all of the text in my app,


496
00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.642 line:-2 align:center
my recipe content
is still very catered


497
00:22:55.676 --> 00:22:57.144 line:-1 align:center
towards a U.S. audience.


498
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:02,149 line:-2
In India, a large portion
of the population are vegetarian


499
00:23:02.182 --> 00:23:05.252 line:-2 align:center
and follow Hinduism,
where cows are revered,


500
00:23:05.285 --> 00:23:08.922 line:-2 align:center
and it's very uncommon,
sometimes banned, to eat them.


501
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:12,092 line:-2
Surfacing suggestions
like beef and sausages


502
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,729 line:-2
can come off as insensitive
to local cultures.


503
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,332 line:-2
Instead,
I could tailor my app's content


504
00:23:18.365 --> 00:23:20.767 line:-2 align:center
to fit with local
dietary customs,


505
00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:23.337 line:-2 align:center
researching dishes
that would be more relevant


506
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.741 line:-2 align:center
and ingredients that are
more widely available in India.


507
00:23:27.774 --> 00:23:29.543 line:-2 align:center
I could also use
this opportunity


508
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:33,080 line:-2
to recognize cultural moments,
like surfacing recipes


509
00:23:33.113 --> 00:23:35.048 line:-2 align:center
typically eaten
during local festivals.


510
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:39,686 line:-2
Together with translation,
acknowledging cultural


511
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,523 line:-2
differences gives my app
a better chance


512
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:45,259 line:-2
of being well-received
in a new country.


513
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:48,161 line:-2
In games,
respecting others cultures can


514
00:23:48.195 --> 00:23:51.198 line:-2 align:center
come into play if you have
characters and environments


515
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:54,201 line:-2
that are inspired by real-life
people and places.


516
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,038 line:-2
An inclusive game is able
to avoid


517
00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:01.208 line:-2 align:center
creating caricatures
of different cultures.


518
00:24:01.241 --> 00:24:03.777 line:-2 align:center
Ask yourself,
"Am I associating an enemy


519
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.114 line:-2 align:center
as someone from an already
marginalized race?"


520
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:11,618 line:-2
or "Am I basing 'exotic' alien
or fantastical characters


521
00:24:11.652 --> 00:24:13.987 line:-2 align:center
"off of the physical traits
and languages


522
00:24:14.021 --> 00:24:17.057 line:-1 align:center
of real ethnicities?"


523
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.760 line:-2 align:center
Even though you're crafting
fictional scenarios,


524
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,995 line:-1
they can still have real impact


525
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:25.532 line:-2 align:center
and hurt players' perceptions
of real people and cultures.


526
00:24:25.566 --> 00:24:28.402 line:-2 align:center
So take care with how
you depict others,


527
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:31,839 line:-2
and engage in conversations
with people from other cultures


528
00:24:31.872 --> 00:24:33.841 line:-2 align:center
to learn how you can adapt
your content


529
00:24:33.874 --> 00:24:36.310 line:-2 align:center
to better serve
and respect them.


530
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:39,713 line:-2
[Sam] The fifth practice
is to use color mindfully.


531
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:41,682 line:-2
Linda mentioned earlier
that different cultures


532
00:24:41.715 --> 00:24:43.784 line:-2 align:center
and languages have idioms
that we should be mindful of


533
00:24:43.817 --> 00:24:45.352 line:-1 align:center
when we're localizing.


534
00:24:45.385 --> 00:24:47.754 line:-1 align:center
The same can apply to color.


535
00:24:47.788 --> 00:24:50.691 line:-2 align:center
Colors elicit emotion,
and some of those emotions


536
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:53,527 line:-2
can change
from culture to culture.


537
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.796 line:-2 align:center
For example,
in many Western countries,


538
00:24:55.829 --> 00:24:57.631 line:-2 align:center
green can symbolize
environmentalism


539
00:24:57.664 --> 00:25:00.934 line:-2 align:center
and going green,
or can, in Western countries,


540
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:04,037 line:-2
come to symbolize luck,
money, or fortune.


541
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:06,974 line:-2
But in a lot of Asian cultures,
red is used to connote fortune,


542
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,442 line:-1
happiness, and well-being.


543
00:25:08,475 --> 00:25:10,277 line:-2
This is why it's considered
good luck to wear red


544
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,180 line:-1
during the Lunar New Year.


545
00:25:13.213 --> 00:25:14.615 line:-1 align:center
In many parts of the world,


546
00:25:14.648 --> 00:25:18.719 line:-2 align:center
red can be associated
with love and red roses.


547
00:25:18,752 --> 00:25:19,987 line:-1
Or red can be associated


548
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.323 line:-2 align:center
with danger, negativity,
and even violence.


549
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,493 line:-2
These associations are why,
for instance,


550
00:25:26.527 --> 00:25:29.897 line:-2 align:center
in most localizations,
Stocks shows green for gains


551
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,399 line:-2
and red for losses,
but why, if you set


552
00:25:32.432 --> 00:25:35.869 line:-2 align:center
your region to Mainland China,
gains are shown in red.


553
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:40,040 line:-2
As mentioned earlier,
in a lot of Asian cultures,


554
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:43,477 line:-2
red connotes fortune
more strongly than green does.


555
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,379 line:-1
There are probably opportunities


556
00:25:45.412 --> 00:25:47.181 line:-2 align:center
to customize your colors
by region to be


557
00:25:47.214 --> 00:25:49.283 line:-2 align:center
more understandable
to a specific culture.


558
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:52,519 line:-2
As with localizing for culture,
the best way to fully understand


559
00:25:52.553 --> 00:25:55.522 line:-2 align:center
whether your color choices are
eliciting the intended emotions


560
00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:57.824 line:-2 align:center
is to ask people
who come from those backgrounds.


561
00:25:59.159 --> 00:26:01.595 line:-2 align:center
Let's also briefly touch
back on accessibility


562
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:03,830 line:0
as it relates
to color blindness.


563
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:06,633 line:0
You might not know that color
blindness affects almost 5%


564
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,335 align:center
of the world's population,


565
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:10,904 line:-2
so make sure your interface
elements don't solely rely


566
00:26:10.938 --> 00:26:12.739 line:-2 align:center
on color to get
their points across.


567
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:15,342 line:-2
Here, we have two kinds of dots
to indicate "unread"


568
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:17,110 line:-1
and "flagged."


569
00:26:17.144 --> 00:26:18.946 line:-2 align:center
But someone who is colorblind
might not be able


570
00:26:18.979 --> 00:26:22.082 line:-2 align:center
to easily distinguish these two
kinds of dots from color alone.


571
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:25,419 line:-2
In such a case,
we might need to instead


572
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:28,655 line:-2
opt to change one
of the dots to a glyph.


573
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:29,990 line:-2
As a result,
you might even end up


574
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:33,660 line:-2
with something that is easier
to understand at a glance.


575
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:35,562 line:-2
Also pay attention
to contrast ratios


576
00:26:35.596 --> 00:26:37.331 line:-1 align:center
between text and backgrounds,


577
00:26:37.364 --> 00:26:40.300 line:-2 align:center
particularly when "Increase
Contrast" is activated.


578
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,002 line:-2
Not only are
some people sensitive


579
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,570 line:-1
to low-contrast interfaces,


580
00:26:43.604 --> 00:26:44.872 line:-2 align:center
there are also
environmental factors,


581
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:47,274 line:-2
like bright sunlight
and use of sunglasses,


582
00:26:47.307 --> 00:26:49.042 line:-2 align:center
that can also benefit
from higher contrast.


583
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:52,980 line:-2
The default iOS palette actually
contains an additional set


584
00:26:53.013 --> 00:26:55.182 line:-2 align:center
of colors to support
high-contrast mode,


585
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:57,217 line:-2
so if your app uses
system colors,


586
00:26:57,251 --> 00:27:00,921 line:-2
you can automatically benefit
from system support.


587
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,723 line:-2
If your app has
its own color palette,


588
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:05,058 line:-2
you're gonna need to calculate
the luminosity ratio


589
00:27:05.092 --> 00:27:07.528 line:-2 align:center
between backgrounds and text,
using tools


590
00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:09.696 line:-2 align:center
that are available on the web
or in the App Store.


591
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:13,867 line:-2
When "Increase Contrast"
mode is turned on,


592
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:17,271 line:-2
aspire to a minimum of 4.5:1
in your interfaces.


593
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:20,774 line:-1
Plugging these colors in,


594
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:24,611 line:-2
we find that our contrast
doesn't meet the bar of 4.5.


595
00:27:24.645 --> 00:27:27.181 line:-1 align:center
What if we try black instead?


596
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:30,150 line:-2
Now, we can see that we're
comfortably over 4.5.


597
00:27:30.184 --> 00:27:32.019 line:-2 align:center
In fact, we should probably
keep this text color,


598
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:34,788 line:-2
regardless of whether
high-contrast mode is turned on.


599
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,490 line:-1
This is just a rough guide.


600
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:39,026 line:-2
There will be cases in which
this ratio is misleading,


601
00:27:39.059 --> 00:27:40.661 line:-2 align:center
and you'll need to use
your own judgment.


602
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:43,931 line:-2
For instance, this color
combination also exceeds the bar


603
00:27:43.964 --> 00:27:47.401 line:-2 align:center
of 4.5, but it's still
hard to read in context.


604
00:27:48.468 --> 00:27:50.704 line:-2 align:center
Correctly assessing
your app or game's contrast


605
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:53,574 line:-2
is as much of an art
as it is a science.


606
00:27:53.607 --> 00:27:55.609 line:-2 align:center
Culture is about more
than words and symbols;


607
00:27:55.642 --> 00:27:57.611 line:-2 align:center
it's about things
like color, too.


608
00:27:57.644 --> 00:27:59.746 line:-2 align:center
And not everybody perceives
the same color palette,


609
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,648 line:-2
so be sure to use color
with care


610
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:04,318 line:-2
so that your app or game
can delight everyone.


611
00:28:05.786 --> 00:28:08.088 line:-2 align:center
[Linda] The last practice
we wanted to share with you


612
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,157 line:-1
is encourage self-expression.


613
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,492 line:-1
Your app or game can acknowledge


614
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,295 line:-2
and celebrate
people's individuality,


615
00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:17.631 line:-2 align:center
and the best way
to make that happen is by not


616
00:28:17,664 --> 00:28:21,168 line:-2
limiting or enforcing how people
can identify themselves.


617
00:28:22.169 --> 00:28:24.171 line:-1 align:center
Take names, for example.


618
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,707 line:-2
When you meet someone new,
"What's your name?"


619
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.475 line:-2 align:center
is one of the first things
you ask them.


620
00:28:29.676 --> 00:28:32.513 line:-2 align:center
It can also be the first thing
your app asks for


621
00:28:32.546 --> 00:28:35.015 line:-2 align:center
when someone launches
your experience.


622
00:28:35.048 --> 00:28:38.051 line:-2 align:center
And your interface should
accept the diversity


623
00:28:38.085 --> 00:28:40.654 line:-1 align:center
of names people can have.


624
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:44,858 line:-2
Very often, names don't pass
form validations


625
00:28:44.892 --> 00:28:47.661 line:-2 align:center
because they have
hyphens or accents,


626
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:51,732 line:-2
or are shorter or longer
than an allowed character count.


627
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:53,834 line:-2
You might have even
experienced this yourself,


628
00:28:53.867 --> 00:28:56.236 line:-2 align:center
or can at least understand
how annoying it would be


629
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,771 line:-2
to have this happen
to you all the time.


630
00:28:59.473 --> 00:29:01.341 line:-1 align:center
So to provide a good experience,


631
00:29:01.375 --> 00:29:04.244 line:-2 align:center
be flexible in supporting
special characters


632
00:29:04.278 --> 00:29:06.947 line:-2 align:center
and not enforcing
specific name lengths.


633
00:29:08.148 --> 00:29:11.151 line:-2 align:center
Also recognize that concepts
like having a first name


634
00:29:11.185 --> 00:29:13.720 line:-2 align:center
and a last name
are very region-specific.


635
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:17,891 line:-2
If you're from Latin America,
chances are you have


636
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:20,260 line:-2
two family names,
one from each parent.


637
00:29:21.695 --> 00:29:23.730 line:-2 align:center
If you're from China,
your family name is


638
00:29:23.764 --> 00:29:26.300 line:-2 align:center
written first
and your personal name last.


639
00:29:28.068 --> 00:29:31.171 line:-2 align:center
And in some countries,
like Malaysia and Afghanistan,


640
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:32,840 line:-2
you might not have
a family name,


641
00:29:32.873 --> 00:29:35.943 line:-2 align:center
and go by just
your personal name.


642
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:38,445 line:-2
If you were any of those people,
how would you approach


643
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:40,414 line:-2
these first and last name
input fields?


644
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,284 line:-2
Depending on what you're
using their name for,


645
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:47,621 line:-2
a more culturally-inclusive
solution can be to provide


646
00:29:47,654 --> 00:29:52,359 line:-2
a single text field for someone
to enter their full name.


647
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:54,661 line:-2
Better yet,
you can always ask people


648
00:29:54.695 --> 00:29:56.463 line:-1 align:center
what their preferred name is,


649
00:29:56.496 --> 00:29:59.233 line:-2 align:center
which can differ from
what they go by legally.


650
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:01,668 line:-2
Providing this type
of flexibility makes sure


651
00:30:01.702 --> 00:30:03.604 line:-2 align:center
that all people's names
are welcome


652
00:30:04.438 --> 00:30:07.274 line:-2 align:center
and creates a more personal
connection if you ever


653
00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:11.645 line:-2 align:center
address someone by name
in your app or game later.


654
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:14,848 line:-2
Similar to names,
gender is also an opportunity


655
00:30:14.882 --> 00:30:17.317 line:-2 align:center
to acknowledge
someone's identity.


656
00:30:17.351 --> 00:30:21.121 line:-2 align:center
As I mentioned earlier,
human gender is a spectrum


657
00:30:21.154 --> 00:30:23.524 line:-2 align:center
and presenting someone
with limited options


658
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:28,262 line:-2
to represent their gender,
such as Male, Female, and Other,


659
00:30:28.295 --> 00:30:31.265 line:-2 align:center
doesn't fully represent
how broad that spectrum is.


660
00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:35.068 line:-2 align:center
The dating app Bumble
is a great example


661
00:30:35.102 --> 00:30:37.104 line:-1 align:center
of presenting gender choices.


662
00:30:37.137 --> 00:30:39.907 line:-2 align:center
At registration,
you have the choice to identify


663
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.077 line:-2 align:center
from a wide range of gender
options and can submit your own.


664
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:45.812 line:-2 align:center
You can also choose
to make your gender


665
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:49,983 line:-2
public or private
and can change it at any time.


666
00:30:50.017 --> 00:30:53.253 line:-2 align:center
An interface like this,
that acknowledges diversity,


667
00:30:53.287 --> 00:30:54.955 line:-1 align:center
makes more people feel welcome.


668
00:30:55.989 --> 00:30:58.892 line:-2 align:center
In games with human
character creation screens,


669
00:30:58.926 --> 00:31:01.161 line:-2 align:center
how you let people
customize themselves


670
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,564 line:-2
is a great way
to acknowledge identity.


671
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:05,832 line:-2
A lot of times,
people craft characters


672
00:31:05.866 --> 00:31:07.634 line:-2 align:center
to look like themselves,
so they can feel


673
00:31:07.668 --> 00:31:09.770 line:-2 align:center
more immersed in a role
or a story.


674
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:13,774 line:-2
You can think back
to the diversity axes


675
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:16,610 line:-2
to consider all the ways people
might want to physically


676
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:20,147 line:-2
represent themselves
with different appearances.


677
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,583 line:-2
And if your narrative
has a romantic element,


678
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:25,485 line:-2
you can give people agency
to choose relationships


679
00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:27.921 line:-2 align:center
based on different
sexual orientations.


680
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:32,726 line:-2
A great example of giving
people customization options


681
00:31:32.759 --> 00:31:35.295 line:-1 align:center
is a game called "Say No! More."


682
00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:37.331 line:-2 align:center
Its gameplay is about
setting boundaries


683
00:31:37.364 --> 00:31:39.266 line:-1 align:center
at work by saying the word "No!"


684
00:31:39.299 --> 00:31:40.133 line:-1 align:center
as a super power.


685
00:31:41.902 --> 00:31:44.638 line:-2 align:center
When you create your character,
there's a wide variety


686
00:31:44.671 --> 00:31:47.841 line:-2 align:center
of ages,
skin colors, body types,


687
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,744 line:-2
hairstyles,
and clothing to choose from.


688
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,681 line:-2
You also can choose
how you say "No!"


689
00:31:54.715 --> 00:31:58.051 line:-2 align:center
based on a number
of languages and vocal tones.


690
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,686 line:-1
Better yet, none of your choices


691
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.756 line:-2 align:center
are bucketed by what gender
your character is.


692
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:05.225 line:-2 align:center
In fact, the game never asks
for your gender


693
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:07,094 line:-1
because it doesn't need to.


694
00:32:07.127 --> 00:32:10.063 line:-2 align:center
Clothing and hair styles don't
belong to a certain gender,


695
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,966 line:-2
and neither does how
someone's voice sounds.


696
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.103 line:-2 align:center
In this case,
not asking for you to identify


697
00:32:16.136 --> 00:32:18.772 line:-2 align:center
makes this game's interface
more inclusive.


698
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:23,277 line:-2
Always prioritize
asking people how they'd like


699
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:26.146 line:-2 align:center
to represent themselves
through your app or game,


700
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,317 line:-2
and design flexible interfaces
that respect those identities.


701
00:32:31.852 --> 00:32:35.489 line:-2 align:center
[Sam] So we've covered
a lot in this video.


702
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:37,858 line:-2
The importance of thinking
carefully about how


703
00:32:37.891 --> 00:32:40.027 line:-2 align:center
you craft the stories
around your app.


704
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.129 line:-1 align:center
Tell diverse stories.


705
00:32:42.162 --> 00:32:44.731 line:-2 align:center
Avoiding stereotypes
in your language and content.


706
00:32:45.933 --> 00:32:47.467 line:-2 align:center
Making sure
that you are taking advantage


707
00:32:47.501 --> 00:32:49.069 line:-1 align:center
of the accessibility features


708
00:32:49.102 --> 00:32:53.073 line:-2 align:center
offered on our platforms
and testing accordingly.


709
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:55,909 line:-2
That your app is thoughtfully
localized and sensitive


710
00:32:55.943 --> 00:32:59.580 line:-2 align:center
to how culture can affect
how content is carried over.


711
00:32:59.613 --> 00:33:03.083 line:-2 align:center
That your app mindfully uses
color, both to respect culture


712
00:33:03.116 --> 00:33:05.586 line:-2 align:center
and those who perceive
color differently.


713
00:33:05.619 --> 00:33:08.322 line:-2 align:center
And lastly, that your app
doesn't unduly restrict


714
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:11,058 line:-2
someone's ability
to identify how they want to.


715
00:33:11.091 --> 00:33:13.760 line:-2 align:center
These practices stem
from our duty to each other


716
00:33:13,794 --> 00:33:15,596 line:-1
to design inclusively


717
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:17,731 line:-2
and to help each person
live their best life.


718
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,570 line:-2
Inclusive design is
welcoming and respectful,


719
00:33:23,604 --> 00:33:26,607 line:-2
and inclusive design
is great for everyone.


720
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:32,312 line:-2
These practices take, well,
practice to get right.


721
00:33:32.346 --> 00:33:35.582 line:-2 align:center
And while this might seem
like a lot to do, it's worth it.


722
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:38,385 line:-2
Because when we craft
something with respect,


723
00:33:38.418 --> 00:33:42.656 line:-2 align:center
consideration, and love,
that care can be felt.


724
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:45,759 line:-2
For more resources
on how you can


725
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,995 line:-2
design inclusively,
check out our new section


726
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:50,998 line:-2
on "Inclusion" in the Human
Interface Guidelines.


727
00:33:51.031 --> 00:33:53.467 line:-2 align:center
And on how you can instill
inclusive principles


728
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,703 line:0
deep into your process,
watch the talk,


729
00:33:56,737 --> 00:33:59,306 align:center
"The process
of inclusive design."


730
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:00,507 line:0
Thanks.
