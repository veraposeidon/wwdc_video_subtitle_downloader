[Luke] Hello.
My name is Luke Larson,


4
00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:13.046 line:-1 align:center
and I'm an Xcode engineer.


5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,650 line:-2
Later, I'll be joined by my
colleague, Youssef Elabd.


6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,886 line:-2
Interface Builder provides
a simple and intuitive way


7
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,621 line:-2
to build app user
interfaces visually


8
00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:23.257 line:-2 align:center
without writing any code,
allowing developers to focus


9
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.860 line:-2 align:center
on what's important in making
their app stand out.


10
00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.296 line:-2 align:center
Today we're going to show you
what's new in Interface Builder


11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,932 line:-2
in Xcode 13 that makes it easier
than ever to utilize


12
00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.801 line:-2 align:center
the latest platform features,
including new system provided


13
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:38,639 line:-2
control styles, to make your app
stand out even more.


14
00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:41.175 line:-2 align:center
In this video, we're going
to cover improvements


15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,677 line:-2
to the Interface Builder
canvas and authoring support


16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,048 line:-2
for button styles,
table content styles,


17
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,818 line:-2
hierarchical symbols,
and accessibility.


18
00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.955 line:-2 align:center
Let's start
with canvas improvements.


19
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,990 align:center
One of the first things you'll
notice with Interface Builder


20
00:00:57,024 --> 00:01:00,994 line:0
in Xcode 13 is the completely
redesigned canvas bottom bar.


21
00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.097 line:-2 align:center
The controls to the left
of the bar provide all the same


22
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,467 line:-2
functionality as before,
but in a more compact form,


23
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,437 line:-2
reserving
more space for the canvas.


24
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.674 line:-2 align:center
There's a popover to choose
a device


25
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:18,245 line:-2
which contains a variety of
devices organized in groups.


26
00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.280 line:-2 align:center
Clicking a different
device group expands it


27
00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:22.482 line:-2 align:center
and causes the previous
group to collapse,


28
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:24,651 line:-2
making it easier to find
the device you're looking for.


29
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.556 line:-2 align:center
There are also buttons
to configure scene layout,


30
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,725 line:-1
orientation, appearance,


31
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,293 line:-2
and all-new accessibility
options


32
00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:36.029 line:-2 align:center
that we'll show
later in the video.


33
00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:37.497 line:-2 align:center
Other improvements
include refinements


34
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,066 line:-1
to the canvas outline view.


35
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,202 line:-2
And to show them, let's jump
into Interface Builder.


36
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,304 line:-2
I'm working on a Booking Scene
in a hotel app,


37
00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:45.572 line:-2 align:center
and I noticed
that it isn't positioned


38
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,475 line:-2
next to the Promotions Scene
in the outline view to the left.


39
00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:53.547 line:-2 align:center
Which is what I expect,
since the Booking Scene


40
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.549 line:-1 align:center
segues to the Promotions Scene.


41
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,018 line:-2
It's now possible to move
and rearrange one or more


42
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.989 line:-2 align:center
selected scenes in the outline
view using drag and drop.


43
00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:04.024 line:-2 align:center
So I'll drag the Booking Scene
down to be positioned


44
00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.959 line:-2 align:center
just above
the Promotions Scene.


45
00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:11.965 line:-2 align:center
Great. Now the two scenes are
positioned next to each other


46
00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.067 line:-2 align:center
and are easier
to navigate between.


47
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,769 line:-2
You can also copy
entire scenes


48
00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:19.139 line:-2 align:center
by holding the Option key
while dragging.


49
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,807 line:-2
Another refinement
to the outline view


50
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:23.677 line:-2 align:center
is that outline groups like
Constraints are now selectable,


51
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.180 line:-2 align:center
allowing for keyboard
navigation and easy modification


52
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:29,449 line:-2
or deletion of entire groups
of objects.


53
00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:31.251 line:-2 align:center
To show this,
I'll select a constraint group


54
00:02:31.285 --> 00:02:34.621 line:-1 align:center
in the outline view.


55
00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:35.856 line:-1 align:center
This is equivalent to selecting


56
00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.591 line:-2 align:center
all the constraints
in the group.


57
00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.159 line:-2 align:center
I'll press the Right Arrow key
to reveal


58
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,461 line:-2
the four edge constraints
contained in the group.


59
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,297 line:-2
Now I can easily modify
the constants


60
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.465 line:-2 align:center
for all group constraints
in the inspector


61
00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.537 line:-2 align:center
Or delete
the entire constraint group


62
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,841 line:-2
by selecting it
and pressing the Delete key.


63
00:02:53.874 --> 00:02:56.577 line:-2 align:center
Next, let's continue
to new button styles.


64
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,581 line:-2
Interface Builder in Xcode 13
supports authoring buttons


65
00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:02.015 line:-1 align:center
with new preset styles,


66
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,451 line:-2
including
the familiar Plain style,


67
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:09,423 line:-2
and three new styles:
Gray, Tinted, and Filled.


68
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,658 line:-2
These new styles make it
easy to create beautiful


69
00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:14.528 line:-2 align:center
and consistent looking buttons
directly in Interface Builder


70
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,797 line:-2
that automatically provide
support for system features


71
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,501 line:-2
like dynamic type, multiline
titles, and accessibility.


72
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,737 line:-2
Additionally, button styles
support further customization


73
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.840 line:-2 align:center
with options like preset button
sizes and corner styles.


74
00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.375 line:-2 align:center
I'll go into
more style customization


75
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,444 line:-1
later in the video.


76
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,579 line:0
Check out the video "Meet
the UIKit button system"


77
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,215 align:center
for more information
on button styles.


78
00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:36.984 line:-2 align:center
Let's jump back into
Interface Builder to show


79
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,386 line:-1
these new styles in action.


80
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,221 align:center
There's a Book Room button
at the bottom of the scene


81
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,257 align:center
that could use some attention.


82
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.859 line:-2 align:center
I'll use pinch-to-zoom
to get a closer look.


83
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,899 line:-2
I'd like this button
to have a fill color


84
00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:54.234 line:-2 align:center
and rounded corners to draw
more attention to it.


85
00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:57.004 line:-2 align:center
In Xcode 13, it's now possible
to create buttons like this


86
00:03:57.037 --> 00:04:00.440 line:-2 align:center
directly in Interface Builder
using button styles.


87
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,677 line:-1
Let's focus on the inspector.


88
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.212 line:-2 align:center
There's a new Style
property near the top


89
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.915 line:-1 align:center
of the Button inspector.


90
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,750 line:-2
When a non-default style is
selected,


91
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,152 line:-2
a button will be opted
into the new button system,


92
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,353 line:-1
automatically getting support


93
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,757 line:-2
for dynamic type, multiline
titles, and accessibility.


94
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,394 line:-2
I'll go ahead and open the Style
pop-up menu in the inspector


95
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,931 line:-2
and select the Filled style
for my Book Room button.


96
00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:26.266 line:-2 align:center
The button now has a blue
fill color and rounded corners


97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,568 line:-1
that look just right.


98
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.437 line:-2 align:center
And all I had to do was
make a single change.


99
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,805 line:-1
Button styles are great


100
00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:34.741 line:-2 align:center
for quickly
getting the look you want.


101
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,844 line:-2
After selecting a style,
new properties appear


102
00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:37.711 line:-1 align:center
in the Button inspector,


103
00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:40.914 line:-2 align:center
enabling further style
customization,


104
00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:43.283 line:-2 align:center
including Subtitle,
title alignment,


105
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,686 line:-1
and color options,


106
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,889 line:-2
image positioning,
Corner Style,


107
00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:51.325 line:-2 align:center
and more advanced background
configuration options.


108
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,462 line:-2
As the name suggests, the Filled
style uses the app tint to set


109
00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:56.797 line:-1 align:center
a button's fill color,


110
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.199 line:-2 align:center
giving it a prominent look
and making it appropriate


111
00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:02.369 line:-2 align:center
for important buttons
in a user interface.


112
00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.137 line:-2 align:center
And corner styles mean you
don't have to worry about


113
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:05.906 line:-2 align:center
setting a specific
corner radius.


114
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,908 line:-2
The default corner style
is called Dynamic,


115
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,511 line:-2
which provides
a great-looking corner radius


116
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,913 line:-2
that automatically scales
with dynamic type,


117
00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:16.049 line:-2 align:center
maintaining the appearance
of the button at any size.


118
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,019 line:-2
Alternatively,
the Fixed corner style's radius


119
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,655 line:-2
remains the same
as button sizes change.


120
00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:23.190 line:-2 align:center
For cases where
more control is needed,


121
00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:24.892 line:-2 align:center
both Dynamic
and Fixed corner styles


122
00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:27.995 line:-2 align:center
have customizable
corner radiuses.


123
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,464 line:-2
Additionally,
a range of preset corner styles


124
00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:33.400 line:-2 align:center
are provided,
including Small, Medium, Large,


125
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:38,705 line:-2
and Capsule, all supporting
dynamic corner scaling.


126
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,307 line:-2
Buttons with styles
also gain access to


127
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,178 line:-2
a new Button Size property
in the Size inspector


128
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,647 line:-1
containing preset button sizes,


129
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.083 line:-2 align:center
including Small, Medium,
and Large.


130
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,485 line:-2
Let's go back
to the hotel app to look


131
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,987 line:-2
for more opportunities
to adopt button styles.


132
00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:56.790 line:-2 align:center
The Check in and Check out
buttons are looking a bit plain.


133
00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:59.092 line:-2 align:center
To make them more visible, I'll
use the Tinted button style,


134
00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:01.195 line:-2 align:center
which has a transparent
tint-colored background


135
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,864 line:-2
and is great for buttons that
are important but don't quite


136
00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:06.800 line:-2 align:center
need the prominent look that
the Filled style provides.


137
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,969 line:-2
I'll select the Check
in and Check out buttons


138
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:11,238 line:-2
in the outline view by holding
the Command key.


139
00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:16.910 line:-2 align:center
And choose Tinted
from the Button Style menu


140
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,146 line:-1
in the inspector.


141
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,621 line:-2
This is exactly what I was
looking for for these buttons.


142
00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:30.490 line:-2 align:center
Moving on, the Promotions Scene
in this app has a few buttons


143
00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:33.861 line:-2 align:center
that would also be perfect
for the new Tinted style.


144
00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:36.763 line:-2 align:center
Let's segue
on over and take a look.


145
00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:38.565 line:-2 align:center
Using the canvas Minimap,
I'll double click


146
00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.801 line:-2 align:center
on the Promotions Scene
to jump directly to it.


147
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.607 line:-2 align:center
This scene displays a list of
active hotel promotions


148
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.242 line:-2 align:center
guests can choose from
by tapping


149
00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:49.877 line:-1 align:center
the appropriate Get button.


150
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.012 line:-2 align:center
Each Get button overlays
an image and will benefit


151
00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:53.580 line:-2 align:center
from the extra
contrast provided by


152
00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:56.450 line:-2 align:center
the transparent background
of the Tinted style.


153
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,285 line:-2
I'll go ahead and select
the three Get buttons


154
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,454 line:-2
in the outline view by
holding the Command key.


155
00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:12.766 line:-2 align:center
and choose Tinted from the Style
menu in the inspector


156
00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:16.303 line:-2 align:center
to change all the button
styles at the same time.


157
00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:23.210 line:-1 align:center
That looks great.


158
00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:24.978 line:-2 align:center
Tinted button title
and background colors


159
00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:26.847 line:-2 align:center
are based on the app's
tint color and provide


160
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.283 line:-2 align:center
the appropriate level
of contrast.


161
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,652 line:-2
I'd also like the Get buttons
to toggle and change


162
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,387 line:-2
their appearance after being
tapped to indicate


163
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,222 line:-2
which promotions
have been selected.


164
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,657 line:-2
I'll configure them
to be toggle buttons


165
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.960 line:-2 align:center
to achieve this behavior,
which are new in iOS 15.


166
00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:42.029 line:-1 align:center
In the inspector under Menu,


167
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,198 line:-2
I'll toggle the "Selection
as Primary Option" property


168
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:46.934 line:-2 align:center
to make the selected
buttons toggle buttons.


169
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,574 line:-2
Before continuing,
I'd like to add a new button


170
00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:56.310 line:-2 align:center
to the Booking Scene to allow
customers to request help.


171
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,915 line:-2
I'll go ahead and open
the object library...


172
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,954 align:center
which now has buttons
preconfigured to use


173
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,556 align:center
the new style system, including
buttons with the Plain style


174
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,927 line:0
and three new styles:
Gray, Tinted, and Filled.


175
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,963 line:0
The Gray style has a transparent
gray background


176
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,998 align:center
which provides
a bit more contrast,


177
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,499 line:0
so I'll drag out a new
Gray button to act


178
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,368 line:0
as a "Get Help" button
and position it


179
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,204 align:center
in the navigation bar.


180
00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:30.010 line:-2 align:center
I'll select the new
button in the outline view...


181
00:08:34.648 --> 00:08:37.618 line:-2 align:center
and use pinch-to-zoom
to get a closer look.


182
00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:43.824 line:-2 align:center
I'll set the button's Title
and Subtitle...


183
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,201 line:-2
its Image
to a question mark symbol...


184
00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:04.444 line:-2 align:center
and to add a bit more space
between the image and titles,


185
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,713 line:-1
I'll set the image Padding.


186
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,151 line:-2
One of the advantages of using
Interface Builder


187
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:12,219 line:-2
is being able
to try out changes


188
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,887 line:-2
and quickly
check the result.


189
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:15.856 line:-2 align:center
I'm not sure which
Corner Style to use here,


190
00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:18.125 line:-2 align:center
so I'll try the Capsule style
to see how it looks.


191
00:09:23.697 --> 00:09:26.466 line:-2 align:center
That looks good, but it's
not what I'm looking for.


192
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,001 line:-2
Instead, I'll choose
the Large Corner Style


193
00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:30.737 line:-1 align:center
to get the desired look.


194
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:32.539 line:-2 align:center
That was easy.
Everything needed to create


195
00:09:32.573 --> 00:09:34.374 line:-2 align:center
great-looking buttons is
now available directly


196
00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:36.343 line:-1 align:center
in the Button inspector.


197
00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:39.012 line:-2 align:center
For cases where more advanced
style customization is desired,


198
00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:40.914 line:-2 align:center
setting a custom
Background Configuration enables


199
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:43,784 line:-2
more fine-grained control by
revealing additional properties,


200
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:47,054 line:-2
including Corner Radius, Stroke,
and Background Image.


201
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,863 line:-2
One of the steps before booking
a room should be selecting


202
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,031 line:-2
the number of guests expected
to stay in the room.


203
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,333 line:-2
I'd like this scene
to have the option


204
00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:01.168 line:-2 align:center
to choose between
1 and 4 guests.


205
00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:03.403 line:-2 align:center
iOS 15 now
supports Pop Up Buttons,


206
00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:05.339 line:-2 align:center
which are perfect
for this feature.


207
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,142 line:-2
A pop-up button is
a button that when clicked


208
00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:11.245 line:-2 align:center
displays
a menu with a list of items.


209
00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:13.680 line:-2 align:center
A single item can then
be selected from that menu,


210
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,450 line:-2
which becomes the new label
of the pop-up button.


211
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,257 line:-2
I've already
created a Guests label,


212
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.893 line:-2 align:center
so all I need to do now
is add a Pop Up Button.


213
00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:28.362 line:-2 align:center
I'll open the object
library and drag one out.


214
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,407 line:-2
Pop Up Buttons also
support button styles,


215
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,476 line:-2
so I'll choose the Tinted
style to match the Check in


216
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:43.710 line:-1 align:center
and Check out buttons.


217
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:51,351 line:-2
Then, I'll create two more
menu items using Option-drag


218
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:54,054 line:-2
to copy the existing menu
items in the outline view.


219
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,830 line:-2
Finally,
I'll configure the menu items


220
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,400 line:-1
to have values from 1 to 4.


221
00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:17.544 line:-2 align:center
Note that when an app
is running on a Mac


222
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:19,880 line:-2
with Mac Catalyst 15,
buttons with styles


223
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,015 line:-2
automatically map
to native macOS variants,


224
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:25.786 line:-2 align:center
making it easier to get your app
looking great on the Mac.


225
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,789 line:-2
iOS pop-up buttons are also now
supported on Mac Catalyst 15,


226
00:11:28.822 --> 00:11:31.391 line:-2 align:center
as well as tooltips,
which provide more information


227
00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:33.427 line:-2 align:center
when the mouse cursor
hovers over a control.


228
00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:36.396 line:-2 align:center
I'm planning to have
a Mac Catalyst version


229
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.298 line:-2 align:center
of this app, so I'll go
ahead and set a Tool Tip


230
00:11:38.332 --> 00:11:41.134 line:-2 align:center
for the new Pop Up Button
in the Control inspector.


231
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.315 line:-1 align:center
And we're done.


232
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,417 line:-2
Note that menu items
must be connected to actions


233
00:11:57.451 --> 00:11:59.820 line:-1 align:center
to display at runtime.


234
00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:04.157 line:-2 align:center
Now that I've adopted new button
styles across the app,


235
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,493 line:-1
let's build and run.


236
00:12:10.297 --> 00:12:12.032 line:-2 align:center
Here's the app running
with the new Gray styled


237
00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.168 line:-2 align:center
Get Help button,
Tinted room options


238
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:16.270 line:-1 align:center
and Filled "Book Room" buttons.


239
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:21,441 line:-2
And finally the Tinted promotion
buttons, and they look great.


240
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,545 line:-2
Next, I'll hand it off
to Youssef,


241
00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:25.979 line:-2 align:center
who will cover
table content styles,


242
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:28,315 line:-2
hierarchical symbols,
and accessibility.


243
00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:29.683 line:-1 align:center
Youssef?


244
00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:31.151 line:-1 align:center
[Youssef] Thanks, Luke.


245
00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:33.020 line:-2 align:center
The next workflow we'll be
visiting is styling


246
00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:34.855 line:-2 align:center
your Table View Cells
using Table View Cell


247
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,324 line:-1
contentconfiguration styles.


248
00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:39.860 line:-2 align:center
Most great hotels also
have a great restaurant.


249
00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:41.762 line:-1 align:center
This hotel is no different.


250
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,665 line:-2
Recently, I've been working
on adding a few views to the app


251
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:47,434 line:-2
to let guests
check out the restaurant's menu.


252
00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:49.403 line:-1 align:center
Let's pick up where I left off.


253
00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:51.872 line:-2 align:center
I'll two-finger doubletap
on his Table View controller


254
00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:53.340 line:-1 align:center
to focus in on it.


255
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,909 line:-2
This static Table View
shows a list of the amenities


256
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,911 line:-2
at the hotel,
and I've recently added


257
00:12:57.945 --> 00:13:01.148 line:-2 align:center
another Table View row
for the restaurant.


258
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,684 line:-2
I want the title labels
in the cells here to stand out


259
00:13:03.717 --> 00:13:06.186 line:-2 align:center
above the subtitle labels
underneath them.


260
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,056 line:-2
One of the new Table View Cell
content configuration styles


261
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,924 line:-2
can give us
the appearance that I want.


262
00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:13.627 line:-2 align:center
Here are some of the cell
layouts you get


263
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.999 line:-2 align:center
with the new
cell styles like grouped header,


264
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:25,038 line:-2
value cell,
and grouped footer.


265
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,174 line:-2
These new styles work great
with images


266
00:13:27.207 --> 00:13:31.078 line:-2 align:center
and also get some functionality
like dynamic type for free.


267
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,013 line:-2
So let's head back
to Interface Builder


268
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:36,049 line:-2
and restyle
the cells in this Table View.


269
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,652 line:-2
I'll select all of the cells
in the document outline,


270
00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:42.589 line:-2 align:center
and I'll click on the Styles
drop down near the top


271
00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:45.359 line:-2 align:center
of the Attributes inspector,
showing me


272
00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:48.128 line:-2 align:center
all of the new content
configuration styles.


273
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:51.098 line:-1 align:center
I'll select Subtitle Cell.


274
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:52.933 line:-2 align:center
Since we're now using
one of the new styles,


275
00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.702 line:-2 align:center
we can change Image Padding
right from the inspector.


276
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:57,471 line:-2
Let's do that here
to put some breathing room


277
00:13:57.504 --> 00:14:00.507 line:-2 align:center
between the cell's labels
and their images.


278
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:03.510 line:-2 align:center
Our cells now have larger,
clearer title labels.


279
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:07,047 line:-2
This is exactly what I wanted,
and a good visual improvement,


280
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.184 line:-2 align:center
but I still think the cells
could do with some more color.


281
00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:12.953 line:-2 align:center
Next, let's go over how
hierarchical symbols


282
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,388 line:-1
can help us out here.


283
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:18,292 align:center
New in iOS 15,
symbols can have multiple layers


284
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:22,496 line:0
that I can specify the color
for on a layer-by-layer basis.


285
00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:26.400 line:-2 align:center
This rendering can add more
color and depth to my symbols.


286
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:29,436 line:-2
There are two new render modes
that take advantage of this.


287
00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:32.940 line:-2 align:center
The first is Hierarchical,
which lets you specify the color


288
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,808 line:-1
for the symbol's primary layer


289
00:14:34.842 --> 00:14:37.144 line:-2 align:center
and derives the colors
for the symbol's other layers


290
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:40,714 line:-2
as reduced alpha versions
of the primary layer color.


291
00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:42.649 line:-1 align:center
The other mode is Palette,


292
00:14:42.683 --> 00:14:44.551 line:-2 align:center
which lets you independently set
the colors


293
00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:46.520 line:-1 align:center
for the symbol's layers.


294
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,089 line:0
You can learn more about
the new symbol rendering modes


295
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,925 line:0
in the "What's new in SF
Symbols" video.


296
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,293 line:-2
The symbols
in our Table View


297
00:14:53.327 --> 00:14:55.929 line:-2 align:center
are currently rendering
in Monochrome mode.


298
00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:59.766 line:-2 align:center
However, I want to emphasize
the symbol's primary elements.


299
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.270 line:-2 align:center
The Hierarchical rendering
mode is perfect for this.


300
00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:06.273 line:-2 align:center
Here are our symbols rendered
using this new mode.


301
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,742 line:-2
The varied opacities
between the symbol's layers


302
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,911 line:-2
give it the emphasis
that I want,


303
00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:14.448 line:-2 align:center
so let's go ahead and adopt this
in Interface Builder.


304
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:17.351 line:-2 align:center
Again, with all of the cells
selected,


305
00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:20.254 line:-2 align:center
I'll click on the Render Mode
drop down for cells' symbols.


306
00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:24.725 line:-2 align:center
I'll select Hierarchical
and choose Tint Color


307
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,360 line:-1
to match my app's color scheme.


308
00:15:28.228 --> 00:15:30.497 line:-2 align:center
Great.
We've given this Amenities view


309
00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:32.799 line:-2 align:center
a fresh new look by using one
of the new


310
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,369 line:-2
content configuration styles
for our cells


311
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,539 line:-2
and the Hierarchical rendering
mode for our symbols.


312
00:15:38.572 --> 00:15:40.674 line:-2 align:center
Now that we've updated
our Amenities view,


313
00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:42.442 line:-1 align:center
let's go over accessibility.


314
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:45,245 line:-2
Let's turn our attention
to the menu item detail view,


315
00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:46.880 line:-2 align:center
which shows us some
more information


316
00:15:46.914 --> 00:15:49.750 line:-2 align:center
on one of the restaurant's
menu items.


317
00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:53.120 line:-2 align:center
The Description Label here
is using the subhead text style,


318
00:15:53.153 --> 00:15:55.155 line:-2 align:center
which means
it supports dynamic type.


319
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:57,191 line:-2
This label
is already pretty wide,


320
00:15:57.224 --> 00:15:58.625 line:-2 align:center
and I suspect
we might run into


321
00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:01.528 line:-2 align:center
some layout issues with some
of the larger type settings.


322
00:16:01.562 --> 00:16:04.031 line:-2 align:center
New in Interface Builder
in Xcode 13,


323
00:16:04.064 --> 00:16:06.166 line:-2 align:center
you can now preview
how your iOS scenes react


324
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,634 line:-1
to Accessibility settings


325
00:16:07.668 --> 00:16:10.971 line:-2 align:center
right in Interface Builder
at design time.


326
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,607 line:0
As Luke mentioned before,
the canvas bottom bar


327
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,276 line:0
has all-new
accessibility options.


328
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,312 align:center
Clicking the Accessibility
button brings up


329
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,080 line:0
a popover showing me
the different settings


330
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,349 align:center
that I can adjust
in Interface Builder.


331
00:16:22.382 --> 00:16:24.585 line:-2 align:center
Some settings can change
text sizes,


332
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:27,120 line:-2
frame values,
and colors in my scenes.


333
00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:30.257 line:-2 align:center
Now I can enable and preview
those settings in my canvas


334
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,427 line:-2
to make sure my views react
as intended.


335
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.596 line:-2 align:center
All right, let's get back
to our Description Label


336
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:39,166 line:-2
and verify that it works well
in larger type sizes.


337
00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:43.337 line:-2 align:center
To do this, I'll open up
the Accessibility popover,


338
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,473 line:-1
activate the settings,


339
00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:48.976 line:-2 align:center
and move
the Dynamic Type slider.


340
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:50.477 line:-2 align:center
Notice that
the Description Label


341
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,180 line:-1
is now out of the view's bounds.


342
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:56,583 line:-2
I can fix this by opening
up the Constraint popover


343
00:16:56.617 --> 00:17:00.454 line:-2 align:center
and adding a trailing
constraint to my label.


344
00:17:00.487 --> 00:17:02.856 line:-2 align:center
I'll also need to change the
label's number of lines property


345
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.026 line:-2 align:center
from the Attributes inspector
and set it to 0.


346
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.564 line:-2 align:center
This makes the label wrap around
to as many lines as needed.


347
00:17:10.597 --> 00:17:13.534 line:-2 align:center
With those changes,
my label is no longer clipped


348
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,602 line:-1
and grows to fit its text.


349
00:17:15.636 --> 00:17:18.772 line:-2 align:center
Dragging the Dynamic Type
slider again,


350
00:17:18.805 --> 00:17:20.274 line:-2 align:center
notice that
the Description Label


351
00:17:20.307 --> 00:17:23.477 line:-2 align:center
now fits great
across all type sizes.


352
00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:27.314 line:-2 align:center
Being able to preview
Accessibility settings


353
00:17:27.347 --> 00:17:29.483 line:-2 align:center
at design time
is really powerful


354
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,318 line:-2
because it allows you
to iterate faster


355
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,587 line:-2
and stay within Interface
Builder when adjusting


356
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.523 line:-2 align:center
your views for the iOS
Accessibility settings.


357
00:17:36.557 --> 00:17:38.959 line:-2 align:center
Now that we've made
all of those changes,


358
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:43,130 line:-2
let's check out our app
running in the simulator.


359
00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:44.898 line:-2 align:center
The cells
in our Amenities Table View


360
00:17:44.932 --> 00:17:46.333 line:-2 align:center
are using one of
the Table View Cell


361
00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:47.968 line:-1 align:center
content configuration styles


362
00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:50.804 line:-2 align:center
that gave us the new
layout that we wanted.


363
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:52,973 line:-2
The cells have the symbols
we configured to use


364
00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:54.541 line:-1 align:center
the Hierarchical rendering mode,


365
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:58,011 line:-2
making the symbol's primary
elements more prominent.


366
00:17:58.045 --> 00:18:01.515 line:-2 align:center
Clicking through to our
menu item detail view,


367
00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:04.451 line:-2 align:center
the Description Label
fits in great here.


368
00:18:04.484 --> 00:18:07.254 line:-2 align:center
To recap, we started off by
touring the more compact


369
00:18:07.287 --> 00:18:10.290 line:-2 align:center
device bar and improvements
to the outline view.


370
00:18:10.324 --> 00:18:12.659 line:-2 align:center
We took a look at how you
can customize your app's buttons


371
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,596 line:-2
using the powerful new
button style system.


372
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:17,865 line:-2
We went over how to adopt
pop-up buttons for both


373
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:21,435 line:-2
iOS and Mac Catalyst,
as well as how to quickly give


374
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,036 line:-2
your Table View Cells
a new layout


375
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.939 line:-2 align:center
using content
configuration styles.


376
00:18:25.973 --> 00:18:28.075 line:-2 align:center
Your symbols can also
get a lot more color


377
00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:31.545 line:-2 align:center
and emphasis with the new
rendering modes.


378
00:18:31.578 --> 00:18:34.047 line:-2 align:center
Finally, we also went
over how previewing


379
00:18:34.081 --> 00:18:37.084 line:-2 align:center
Accessibility settings at design
time makes it much easier


380
00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.653 line:-2 align:center
to ensure that your app's views
work as intended


381
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:44,024 line:0
for the many iOS Accessibility
settings available.


382
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,093 line:0
We made all of these
changes without writing


383
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,129 line:0
a single line of code,
letting you spend more time


384
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,899 align:center
focusing on what
makes your app stand out.


385
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,003 line:0
We invite you to use all the
tools we talked about today


386
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:59,373 align:center
to refresh, stylize,
and modernize your app.


387
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:00,707 align:center
And be sure to sure to check out


388
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:02,409 align:center
the "Meet the UIKit
button system"


389
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:05,579 align:center
and "What's new
in SF Symbols" videos.


390
00:19:05.612 --> 00:19:09.149 line:-2 align:center
Thanks for watching,
and have a great WWDC21.


391
