[Holly]
Hi, my name is Holly,


5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,180 line:-2
and I’m a manager
on the Continuous Integration


6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,348 line:-1
Technologies Team,


7
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:17.351 line:-2 align:center
and I’ll later be joined
by my teammate Geoff McGinnis.


8
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,854 line:-2
Today, it’s my pleasure
to introduce Xcode Cloud,


9
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,689 line:-2
an easy-to-use
continuous integration


10
00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:25.125 line:-2 align:center
and delivery service
designed for developers


11
00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.994 line:-2 align:center
just like you,
anyone who’s building


12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,929 line:-2
apps and frameworks
for Apple platforms.


13
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,565 line:-2
In this session,
we’re gonna start


14
00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.967 line:-2 align:center
with an introduction
to continuous integration


15
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.669 line:-1 align:center
and meet Xcode Cloud.


16
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,939 line:-2
Then we’ll setup a project,
make a code change,


17
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,675 line:-2
and learn how to use Xcode Cloud
to collaborate with your team.


18
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.011 line:-1 align:center
Let’s get started.


19
00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:48.549 line:-2 align:center
Continuous integration or CI
is the practice


20
00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.717 line:-2 align:center
of integrating
code changes regularly,


21
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:53.220 line:-2 align:center
so that issues
are caught and fixed early.


22
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,588 line:-2
Adopting this practice
allows teams


23
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,323 line:-1
to work collaboratively


24
00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:58.692 line:-2 align:center
while also creating
high-quality products.


25
00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:03.330 line:-2 align:center
A typical CI workflow
is a set of automated steps


26
00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.199 line:-2 align:center
that runs when you
or a team member


27
00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.601 line:-2 align:center
push a code change
to your repository.


28
00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.604 line:-2 align:center
These steps can do things
like build, run tests,


29
00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:12.239 line:-1 align:center
or any other number of actions


30
00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.141 line:-2 align:center
needed to ensure
that the code change


31
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,411 line:-2
meets your team’s
established level of quality.


32
00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.813 line:-2 align:center
With CI,
you can have peace of mind


33
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:22,382 line:-2
that integrating a change
is low-risk


34
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,085 line:-2
and that your next release
is stable.


35
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,888 line:-2
Now, to think about what CI
might look like for you,


36
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.857 line:-2 align:center
let’s take a look
at the life cycle of an app.


37
00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.660 line:-2 align:center
As a developer,
you’re likely working


38
00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:35.729 line:-2 align:center
with feedback
from multiple sources.


39
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,265 line:-2
You fix bugs
and create features in Xcode,


40
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,400 line:-2
you receive code review feedback
from your team


41
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,469 line:-2
on pull requests,
and you distribute


42
00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:45.706 line:-2 align:center
new versions via TestFlight
and integrate tester feedback.


43
00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:49.376 line:-2 align:center
Your team’s ability
to iterate on code


44
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,412 line:-2
and feedback productively
is essential to creating


45
00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:54.848 line:-1 align:center
a high-quality app or framework.


46
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:57,784 line:-2
That’s where Xcode Cloud
comes in.


47
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:01,655 line:-2
Xcode Cloud builds upon the idea
of CI while connecting the dots


48
00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.324 line:-2 align:center
between Apple developer tools
to provide you


49
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,660 line:-2
with the complete
development pipeline


50
00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.862 line:-1 align:center
to build, test, distribute,


51
00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:10.631 line:-2 align:center
collect feedback,
and quickly iterate


52
00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:11.965 line:-1 align:center
on your projects.


53
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,901 line:-2
Let’s take a tour
of the features


54
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,269 line:-1
to learn about what you can do.


55
00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.840 line:-2 align:center
You spend most of your time
developing in Xcode,


56
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,543 line:-2
and Xcode Cloud
is right there in Xcode.


57
00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.279 line:-2 align:center
Here, you can see
Xcode Cloud in action.


58
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,047 line:-2
There are multiple workflows
set up


59
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,249 line:-2
and builds are running
and catching issues.


60
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:31,652 line:-2
You also get a new insight
into all of the work


61
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:32,686 line:-1
your team is doing.


62
00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:37.758 line:-2 align:center
A workflow is a configuration
that tells Xcode Cloud


63
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:41.361 line:-2 align:center
which actions to perform
and when to perform them.


64
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,564 line:-2
You can breeze through
the easy onboarding


65
00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:46.033 line:-2 align:center
and get your first workflow
up and running quickly.


66
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,768 line:-2
Then you can come back
and edit it,


67
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,270 line:-2
or make new workflows
to support different use cases.


68
00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.109 line:-2 align:center
The result of running a workflow
is called a build.


69
00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:57.744 line:-1 align:center
Xcode Cloud runs builds


70
00:02:57.778 --> 00:02:59.947 line:-2 align:center
in Apple managed
Cloud infrastructure


71
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,182 line:-2
that provides
code signing and access


72
00:03:02.216 --> 00:03:04.151 line:-2 align:center
to multiple
operating system versions


73
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.119 line:-1 align:center
and Xcode releases.


74
00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:07.254 line:-1 align:center
When you click on your app


75
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,456 line:-2
in the Cloud tab
of the report navigator,


76
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,658 line:-2
you can view the status
of all of your workflows


77
00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:13.493 line:-2 align:center
and the latest builds
in the sidebar.


78
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,198 line:-2
Clicking your app also opens
the build group overview,


79
00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:20.467 line:-2 align:center
which shows all of your builds
organized by the way


80
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,203 line:-2
your development team works,
not just by workflow


81
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,640 line:-2
but also by git branch,
allowing you to use one workflow


82
00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:29.343 line:-2 align:center
for many branches but still see
the results separately.


83
00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:32.880 line:-2 align:center
You can also filter
down the list


84
00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:35.649 line:-2 align:center
to see only builds
started by your code changes,


85
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:39,319 line:-2
by clicking the Mine filter
above the overview...


86
00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:42.456 line:-2 align:center
or by selecting the person icon
in the report navigator.


87
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,226 line:-2
One level down
from the build group overview


88
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,630 line:-2
is the build report
for a single run of a workflow.


89
00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:51.798 line:-2 align:center
This is where you can deep-dive
into the results


90
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,901 line:-1
specific to your code change.


91
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,104 line:-2
You can view test reports,
logs, and jump directly


92
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,072 line:-2
into the code
that caused an issue.


93
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,642 line:-2
Geoff will go into more details
of the build report later.


94
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.613 line:-2 align:center
Everything we just saw
is not only available in Xcode,


95
00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:09.583 line:-2 align:center
but it’s also available
in App Store Connect.


96
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,452 line:-2
This includes starting
and viewing builds,


97
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,054 line:-1
managing workflows,


98
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,023 line:-2
viewing
and downloading artifacts,


99
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,624 line:-1
sharing results with your team,


100
00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:19.860 line:-2 align:center
and managing
notification settings.


101
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,095 line:-2
And if you’re already
working in TestFlight,


102
00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.298 line:-2 align:center
Xcode Cloud
is the tab right next door


103
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:26.200 line:-2 align:center
in App Store Connect
for quick access.


104
00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:29.670 line:-2 align:center
In App Store Connect,
you can also set up


105
00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:32.105 line:-2 align:center
your personal
notification settings.


106
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,740 line:-2
I like to set up
Slack notifications


107
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,076 line:-2
for failing builds
so I can continue working


108
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,378 line:-2
after pushing my code
but get alerted quickly


109
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,214 line:-1
if there’s something to fix.


110
00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:42.516 line:-2 align:center
Everyone on your team
can set up notifications


111
00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:43.717 line:-1 align:center
that work best for them.


112
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,488 line:-2
Whether you’re on the go,
or want visibility into builds


113
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,991 line:-2
of a project
you don’t have set up in Xcode,


114
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,026 line:-2
or you’re a member of a team
who isn’t committing code


115
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.163 line:-2 align:center
to a project,
Xcode Cloud in App Store Connect


116
00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:59.566 line:-2 align:center
provides a fully-featured
web-based experience.


117
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,636 line:-2
When we created Xcode Cloud,
we designed it


118
00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.338 line:-1 align:center
for your development process


119
00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:06.607 line:-2 align:center
and for collaboration
with your team,


120
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.376 line:-2 align:center
but it has also been built
with privacy at its core.


121
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:13,514 line:-2
Your source code
is the heart of your project.


122
00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:16.683 line:-2 align:center
That’s why all aspects
of Xcode Cloud are designed


123
00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:19.186 line:-2 align:center
to ensure
that your data is protected.


124
00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:23.357 line:-2 align:center
Build environments
are temporary.


125
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.592 line:-2 align:center
Workloads
are completely isolated,


126
00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:27.027 line:-1 align:center
and environments are torn down


127
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.630 line:-2 align:center
and created from scratch
between builds.


128
00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.798 line:-1 align:center
Source code is never stored.


129
00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:33.867 line:-1 align:center
Xcode Cloud fetches your code


130
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,770 line:-2
only within
the temporary build environment.


131
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,306 line:-2
Build data is encrypted at rest
and stored


132
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,542 line:-2
in a dedicated
CloudKit database.


133
00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:44.077 line:-2 align:center
And you’re
in control of your data.


134
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,280 line:-2
You can delete your data
at any time,


135
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,814 line:-2
and it will be
completely removed


136
00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:48.849 line:-1 align:center
from the system.


137
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.119 line:-2 align:center
Now that I’ve introduced
Xcode Cloud,


138
00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:54.555 line:-2 align:center
I’m gonna hand it over to Geoff
to walk through getting set up.


139
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,724 line:-2
[Geoff]
Let’s get started onboarding


140
00:05:57.758 --> 00:05:59.126 line:-1 align:center
to Xcode Cloud.


141
00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.128 line:-2 align:center
It takes only a few simple steps
to get started


142
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:02.529 line:-2 align:center
thanks to
the powerful integration


143
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:03,564 line:-1
with Xcode.


144
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,300 line:-2
The process begins
by visiting


145
00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:08.535 line:-2 align:center
the Xcode Cloud section
of the product menu


146
00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.170 line:-1 align:center
and selecting Create Workflow.


147
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,313 line:-2
Next, I select which app
I’d like to onboard


148
00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:21.982 line:-2 align:center
from these options
detected for my local project.


149
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,451 line:-2
Today, I’ll pick
this new smoothie ordering app


150
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,420 line:-2
my team is developing
called “Fruta.”


151
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,956 line:-2
The app supports
both iOS and macOS,


152
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,425 line:-2
and we’ll onboard both platforms
together at once.


153
00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.998 line:-2 align:center
Our app begins
with a default first workflow


154
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:39.633 line:-1 align:center
created automatically for me.


155
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,603 line:-2
By inspecting my local project,
Xcode Cloud can tailor


156
00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:44.805 line:-2 align:center
these initial workflow settings
to match my team’s


157
00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:46.473 line:-1 align:center
existing configurations.


158
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,410 line:-2
Workflows are made up
of a start condition,


159
00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:53.146 line:-2 align:center
an environment,
the set of actions


160
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.449 line:-2 align:center
to be performed,
and post-actions


161
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,551 line:-2
such as deployments
and notifications.


162
00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:02.890 line:-2 align:center
And I can see Xcode Cloud
selected every push


163
00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:05.392 line:-2 align:center
to the main branch
as the start condition,


164
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.828 line:-2 align:center
the latest released Xcode
for my environment,


165
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,764 line:-2
and archive actions
for both iOS and macOS.


166
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,901 line:-2
I have the option
of changing these settings,


167
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,603 line:-2
but this looks good to me,
so I’ll continue on.


168
00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:18.338 line:-2 align:center
For a deep dive
into workflow editing,


169
00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:21.375 line:-2 align:center
check out the “Explore
Xcode Cloud Workflows” session


170
00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:22.576 line:-1 align:center
later in the conference.


171
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:27,514 line:-2
Next, I’ll authorize Xcode Cloud
to access my source code.


172
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,651 line:-2
This is a one-time action
covering all source repositories


173
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,921 line:-2
required to build my project
including the primary repo,


174
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,990 line:-2
any submodules,
and private Swift packages.


175
00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:39.359 line:-2 align:center
For any publicly
accessible repositories,


176
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,461 line:-2
no additional authorization
is necessary.


177
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.666 line:-2 align:center
Xcode Cloud discovered
the two private repos


178
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,935 line:-2
within my project,
so, next, we’ll grant


179
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,572 line:-2
explicit permissions to GitHub
where the source is hosted.


180
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:54,908 line:-2
Clicking Grant Access
takes me to App Store Connect


181
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,044 line:-2
with more details
about the next steps.


182
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,514 line:-2
It’s important to note
that this process will vary


183
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,149 line:-2
depending on
the source provider,


184
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,152 line:-2
and I can revoke access
at any time for any reason.


185
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,655 line:-1
Granting source code access


186
00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:10.991 line:-2 align:center
to Xcode Cloud
is completed on the web,


187
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,327 line:-2
and this assistant
guides me through the process.


188
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,832 line:-2
First, I connect my Apple ID
with my source account,


189
00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:20.968 line:-2 align:center
which is used to enable
a personalized experience


190
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.736 line:-1 align:center
in Xcode Cloud.


191
00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.071 line:-1 align:center
This step leverages


192
00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:26.006 line:-2 align:center
the provider’s
native authentication flow


193
00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:28.175 line:-2 align:center
and Xcode Cloud’s
secure encryption,


194
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,077 line:-2
so I know my code
and personal information


195
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,111 line:-1
remain protected.


196
00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:35.616 line:-2 align:center
Then I install
the Xcode Cloud application


197
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,284 line:-1
to my GitHub organization,


198
00:08:37.317 --> 00:08:39.653 line:-2 align:center
enabling access
to the repos I select.


199
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,222 line:-1
Great!


200
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,025 line:-2
With those steps complete,
my GitHub account is all set.


201
00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:47.461 line:-2 align:center
Let’s finish the onboarding
in Xcode locally.


202
00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:51.164 line:-2 align:center
Repositories are ready.
I’ll continue.


203
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,135 line:-2
In the final step,
Xcode Cloud will offer


204
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,570 line:-1
to register my application


205
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,306 line:-2
and bundle ID
to App Store Connect.


206
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,375 line:-2
Our application
is already created,


207
00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:03.177 line:-2 align:center
so I’ll just confirm
the details here.


208
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,378 line:-1
Everything looks good.


209
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,649 line:-2
Now that my app is configured
for Xcode Cloud,


210
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,484 line:-2
I can wrap up
the onboarding process,


211
00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:11.985 line:-2 align:center
which will kick off
my first build.


212
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,721 line:-2
Looks like
my first build is finished.


213
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,757 line:-2
Let’s take
a deeper look at the results.


214
00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:20.827 line:-2 align:center
The build group overview
shows my active


215
00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:22.629 line:-2 align:center
and completed builds
at a glance,


216
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:23,897 line:-1
and clicking the first entry


217
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,899 line:-2
opens up
the overview page for our build.


218
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,840 line:-2
This overview shows me
brief details about the build


219
00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:35.576 line:-2 align:center
such as durations
and environment configurations,


220
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,945 line:-2
with the lower section
showing me the status


221
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,980 line:-2
of all actions
and post-actions involved.


222
00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:44.852 line:-2 align:center
Also, the top-right
has helpful buttons


223
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,554 line:-2
to rebuild the run again,
and check out this revision


224
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,922 line:-1
in my local environment.


225
00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:53.227 line:-2 align:center
Leaving the overview
and expanding an action node,


226
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,762 line:-2
such as the passing
“Archive-iOS” one


227
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,831 line:-2
shows the summary
of this specific action.


228
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,104 line:-2
And within the view,
I can find logs and artifacts


229
00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:05.305 line:-1 align:center
produced by this run.


230
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,345 line:-2
The logs page neatly organizes
all the tasks


231
00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:13.614 line:-2 align:center
within this action,
with filters available


232
00:10:13.647 --> 00:10:15.983 line:-2 align:center
at the top to focus
on areas that need attention.


233
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,586 line:-2
I also have
easy access to binaries,


234
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.688 line:-2 align:center
log files,
and other artifacts produced


235
00:10:21.722 --> 00:10:23.357 line:-2 align:center
by my build
in the artifacts page.


236
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,194 line:-2
This all makes
for a very convenient way


237
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,429 line:-2
for my teammates and I
to access our CI content


238
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,464 line:-1
right here in Xcode.


239
00:10:31.698 --> 00:10:34.434 line:-2 align:center
Now let’s investigate why
the Mac archive action failed


240
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,036 line:-1
by visiting the action summary.


241
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,941 line:-2
Similar to the logs view,
I can filter these issues


242
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,576 line:-1
by type for efficient triage.


243
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:46.880 line:-2 align:center
Looks like our first CI build
caught an import issue


244
00:10:46.914 --> 00:10:48.882 line:-2 align:center
I previously missed
for our Mac app,


245
00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:51.218 line:-2 align:center
and since I’m triaging
my results in Xcode,


246
00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:53.153 line:-2 align:center
I can use this jump button
within an issue


247
00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:55.455 line:-2 align:center
to navigate directly
to the code I need to fix.


248
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,962 line:-2
I’ll make a quick code change
to clean things up.


249
00:11:04.932 --> 00:11:07.267 line:-2 align:center
And I want our CI builds
to get off to a good start,


250
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:08,268 line:-1
so I’ll go ahead and commit


251
00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:09.937 line:-2 align:center
and push it
to my remote repository.


252
00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:23.817 line:-2 align:center
And right after
I push my change,


253
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:26.320 line:-2 align:center
I see Xcode Cloud
has started a new build for me.


254
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,456 line:-2
And I can continue
to follow along


255
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,891 line:-1
with all my changes live.


256
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,661 line:-2
I’m pretty excited
with my quick progress.


257
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,364 line:-2
By running our CI builds
on Apple’s Cloud Infrastructure,


258
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,966 line:-2
our team will collaborate
on our project


259
00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:40.567 line:-1 align:center
more efficiently than ever.


260
00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:42.402 line:-2 align:center
Now, back to Holly
to join in on the fun.


261
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:44,571 line:-2
[Holly]
Thanks, Geoff,


262
00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:46.039 line:-1 align:center
for getting Xcode Cloud set up


263
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,041 line:-2
and running
for our project Fruta.


264
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,910 line:-1
As a member of the same team,


265
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,712 line:-2
I can open
the Fruta Xcode project


266
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,647 line:-2
on my Mac
and see all of the workflows


267
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.415 line:-2 align:center
and builds that Geoff
and the rest of our team


268
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:56,450 line:-1
have been working on.


269
00:11:57.718 --> 00:12:00.420 line:-2 align:center
Here in the report navigator
on the Cloud tab


270
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:01,955 line:-1
when I click on my project name,


271
00:12:01.989 --> 00:12:03.924 line:-2 align:center
because workflows
are shared within teams,


272
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,360 line:-2
I can see the default workflow
that Geoff just created.


273
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,997 line:-2
It looks like Build 2
that Geoff started


274
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.833 line:-2 align:center
when he fixed the import error
has completed successfully.


275
00:12:12.866 --> 00:12:14.701 line:-2 align:center
Now that we have
a passing build,


276
00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:16.904 line:-2 align:center
let’s edit the workflow
to see what it does,


277
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,539 line:-2
and find out what improvements
we can make


278
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,274 line:-2
to get additional coverage
for Fruta.


279
00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:22.209 line:-2 align:center
I can right-click
on the workflow name


280
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,844 line:-1
and select Edit Workflow.


281
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,081 line:-2
Let’s start
by giving the workflow


282
00:12:28.115 --> 00:12:29.716 line:-1 align:center
a more descriptive name.


283
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,418 line:-2
Let’s call this workflow
“Releases”


284
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,920 line:-2
since we’re gonna be
building and testing


285
00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:35.355 line:-2 align:center
a couple of branches
we use for our releases.


286
00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:43.163 line:-2 align:center
Now,
let’s edit the start condition.


287
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,831 line:-2
I’ll select
the start condition section


288
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,100 line:-2
from the sidebar
to bring up the configuration.


289
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,672 line:-2
Remember, the start condition
defines what needs to happen


290
00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:53.407 line:-1 align:center
to cause the workflow to run.


291
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,275 line:-2
The default is set
to start when a code change


292
00:12:55.309 --> 00:12:56.643 line:-2 align:center
is pushed
to your main branch.


293
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,180 line:-2
My team
also uses a release branch,


294
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,282 line:-2
so let’s go ahead
and add that here too.


295
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:05,285 line:-2
I just click on the plus button
in the custom branches section


296
00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:07.287 line:-2 align:center
and type my branch name
in the table row.


297
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.629 line:-2 align:center
That looks good
for the start condition.


298
00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:17.064 line:-1 align:center
Now let’s move on to actions.


299
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,434 line:-2
The default workflow
automatically creates


300
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,336 line:-2
archive actions
for all platforms


301
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,971 line:-1
that my project runs on.


302
00:13:24.004 --> 00:13:26.139 line:-2 align:center
This is a great foundation
to build upon,


303
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,875 line:-2
but to add
some additional coverage,


304
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,243 line:-1
I’d like to add some tests here.


305
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:31,778 line:-1
I click the plus button


306
00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:32.946 line:-2 align:center
to the right
of the Actions header


307
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.415 line:-2 align:center
in the sidebar
and select the Test action type.


308
00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:39.219 line:-2 align:center
For the Test action,
I can select the platform--


309
00:13:39.253 --> 00:13:40.888 line:-1 align:center
let’s do iOS--


310
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,824 line:-2
then select the correct scheme,
Fruta iOS in our case.


311
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,895 line:-2
In the sidebar,
there’s still a red X


312
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,297 line:-2
next to our new Test action
because we haven’t yet


313
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.032 line:-2 align:center
filled out everything
that’s required.


314
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,634 line:-2
The last setting
I need to configure


315
00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:56.603 line:-2 align:center
is adding some devices
for these tests to run on.


316
00:13:56.637 --> 00:13:59.273 line:-2 align:center
Clicking the plus button
below the Destination table


317
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:02,142 line:-2
automatically adds
recommended iPhone simulators...


318
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,247 line:-2
And clicking one more time
adds recommended iPads.


319
00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:14.688 line:-2 align:center
I can also change these to pick
a specific device simulator.


320
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,823 line:-2
Let’s choose the latest iPhone
to make sure my app


321
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,759 line:-1
works great on iPhone 12.


322
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,831 line:-2
Notice that all
of the destinations


323
00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:28.101 line:-2 align:center
I’ve added are automatically set
to use the latest OS version.


324
00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:32.139 line:-2 align:center
I can review
my workflow in the sidebar,


325
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,975 line:-2
and everything looks good to me,
so let’s save the changes


326
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,544 line:-2
by clicking the Save button
in the bottom right-hand corner.


327
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,317 line:-2
Now that we’ve made changes
to the workflow,


328
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.319 line:-2 align:center
I want to make sure it works
without having to make


329
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,887 line:-1
a code change to start it.


330
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,755 line:-2
I can do that manually
by right-clicking


331
00:14:48.789 --> 00:14:50.657 line:-2 align:center
on the workflow
in the report navigator


332
00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:52.526 line:-1 align:center
and selecting Start Build.


333
00:14:57.931 --> 00:15:00.834 line:-2 align:center
Next, I’m prompted to choose
which branch I want to run.


334
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:02,503 line:-1
Let’s try it with “release/v1”


335
00:15:02.536 --> 00:15:04.571 line:-2 align:center
since we’ve just added
that branch to the workflow.


336
00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:07.608 line:-2 align:center
And from here,
I click Start Build


337
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,643 line:-1
to kick it off.


338
00:15:09.676 --> 00:15:12.846 line:-2 align:center
Great, it looks like
our new build is running.


339
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.615 line:-2 align:center
Now,
in the build group overview,


340
00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:17.150 line:-2 align:center
there’s a new section
for our release/v1 branch,


341
00:15:17.184 --> 00:15:19.520 line:-2 align:center
and the new build
I just started, Build 3,


342
00:15:19.553 --> 00:15:22.322 line:-2 align:center
appears here
with a running status.


343
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,324 line:-2
After this completes,
I’ll have a good idea


344
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,193 line:-2
of how our release branch
is doing.


345
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:29,029 line:-2
Then I can continue to add
to the release workflow


346
00:15:29.062 --> 00:15:31.331 line:-2 align:center
or create new ones to support
how my team works.


347
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,837 line:0
Xcode Cloud
made it really simple


348
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,739 align:center
to adopt a continuous
integration practice


349
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,873 align:center
for our app.


350
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:42,009 line:0
With just a few clicks,
Geoff got us set up


351
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,211 align:center
and fixed an issue
that the workflow found.


352
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:47,414 line:0
Then I was able to easily see
everything he had already done,


353
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,317 align:center
and make our workflow
more robust.


354
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,920 line:0
Your team’s ability
to iterate on both code


355
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,123 align:center
and feedback productively
is essential to creating


356
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,659 line:0
a high-quality app or framework.


357
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,728 align:center
With Xcode Cloud,
you can easily setup CI,


358
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,131 align:center
and whether this
is a totally new practice


359
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,166 line:0
or makes your process seamless,


360
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,735 line:0
you can be more productive
and feel more confident


361
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:10,971 align:center
that your users
will have a great experience


362
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,005 line:0
with your product.


363
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,542 line:-2
We hope this session
helped you get acquainted


364
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:17,978 line:-2
with Xcode Cloud
and Continuous Integration.


365
00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:20.080 line:-2 align:center
From our team
in Vancouver, Canada,


366
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,815 line:-2
and on behalf of Geoff
and myself,


367
00:16:21.849 --> 00:16:25.118 line:-2 align:center
thank you and enjoy
the rest of WWDC 2021.
