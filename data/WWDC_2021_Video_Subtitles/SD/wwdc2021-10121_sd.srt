00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,212 line:-2
[Nandini] Hello,
I am Nandini Sundara Raman,


4
00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.947 line:-2 align:center
and today,
I will be showing you


5
00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.216 line:-2 align:center
how you can tailor
the VoiceOver experience


6
00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:20.320 line:-2 align:center
in your data-rich apps
using AXCustomContent API.


7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,823 line:-2
VoiceOver
is Apple's screen reader


8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.292 line:-2 align:center
that lets you interact
with any Apple device,


9
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.461 line:-2 align:center
even if
you can't see the screen.


10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,130 line:-2
You can use VoiceOver
by touching the screen


11
00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.132 line:-2 align:center
to listen
to what is under your finger


12
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,801 line:-2
and then perform
simple gestures like swipe


13
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.970 line:-1 align:center
to navigate the interface.


14
00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.606 line:-2 align:center
So, here I have a simple
app that I created


15
00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.108 line:-1 align:center
called Woof Woof Kennel


16
00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:44.411 line:-2 align:center
where we have detailed
descriptions of several dogs


17
00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:45.913 line:-1 align:center
listed in a table view,


18
00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.415 line:-2 align:center
and VoiceOver user can
swipe through the list


19
00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.350 line:-1 align:center
to explore the kennel.


20
00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.786 line:-2 align:center
Let's have a quick look
of the VoiceOver experience


21
00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.588 line:-1 align:center
of this app.


22
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,723 line:-2
[VoiceOver] Bailey, beagle,
happy-go-lucky,


23
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.892 line:-2 align:center
excellent hunting dog,
and loyal companion.


24
00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.562 line:-2 align:center
Popularity, number one.
Age, three years.


25
00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:04.965 line:-2 align:center
Weight, 25 pounds.
Height, 14 inches.


26
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.135 line:-2 align:center
Winston, pug,
loving, intelligent,


27
00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:10.337 line:-1 align:center
affectionate, loyal, charming,


28
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,805 line:-1
playful, and mischievous.


29
00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:13.373 line:-1 align:center
Popularity, number two.


30
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.443 line:-2 align:center
Age, three years.
Weight, 14 pounds.


31
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,845 line:-1
Height, 10 inches.


32
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,113 line:-2
[Nandini] Whoa!
That was a lot of data


33
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,082 line:-2
read by VoiceOver
for each dog


34
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.650 line:-2 align:center
where all the contents
of the cell


35
00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:26.286 line:-2 align:center
was read from top left
to bottom right.


36
00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:29.523 line:-2 align:center
While navigating an interface
with VoiceOver,


37
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,692 line:-2
too much data
can be overwhelming,


38
00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.393 line:-1 align:center
with cognitive load on users,


39
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.829 line:-2 align:center
and make your app
hard to navigate.


40
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,898 line:-1
And too little data


41
00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:41.068 line:-2 align:center
will result in incomplete
experience of your app.


42
00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.170 line:-1 align:center
Both extremes are frustrating,


43
00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:45.239 line:-2 align:center
and finding a balance here
might be difficult


44
00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.475 line:-2 align:center
because different users might
want different information


45
00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:50.043 line:-1 align:center
when using your app.


46
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,645 line:-1
To achieve this balance,


47
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,848 line:-2
we have the Accessibility
Custom Content API.


48
00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:58.285 line:-2 align:center
This class and protocol
in Accessibility framework


49
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,420 line:-1
is available on all platforms.


50
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:05,125 line:-2
A common issue with presenting
complex data with Voiceover


51
00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:07.027 line:-1 align:center
is solved by this API


52
00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:10.130 line:-2 align:center
by delivering accessibility
information to your users


53
00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:11.765 line:-1 align:center
in measured portions.


54
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,303 line:-2
With this API, you can leverage
assistive technologies


55
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,273 line:-2
to present only the content
your app users need


56
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,941 line:-1
when they need it.


57
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:24.811 line:-2 align:center
Now, let's look at how
AXCustomContent API


58
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,781 line:-2
can be implemented
in our data-rich apps.


59
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,116 line:-1
And to do that,


60
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,919 line:-2
first I would like to show you
how my app looks


61
00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.255 line:-2 align:center
with AXCustomContent API
implemented.


62
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,025 line:-2
[VoiceOver] Bailey, beagle.
More content available.


63
00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:39.760 line:-2 align:center
[Nandini] Yes!
You heard that right.


64
00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.028 line:-1 align:center
VoiceOver just announced


65
00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:43.897 line:-2 align:center
that we have more content
available on this cell.


66
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,200 line:-2
By this, it means that
you can access


67
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,968 line:-1
additional content on this cell


68
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,636 line:-1
using the More Content rotor.


69
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,007 line:-2
Voiceover rotors enable users
to navigate applications


70
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,243 line:-1
quickly and efficiently.


71
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,878 line:-1
It has many built-in uses


72
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,280 line:-2
such as setting
the VoiceOver language,


73
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,049 line:-1
adjusting the speaking rate,


74
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,652 line:-2
and also moving between
the links on a web page, etc.


75
00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.488 line:-2 align:center
Here, with More Content rotor,
we can navigate


76
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,490 line:-2
between additional content
of an element


77
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,059 line:-1
under the VoiceOver cursor.


78
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,262 line:-2
To get to the More Content
rotor with VoiceOver


79
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,697 line:-1
in iOS devices,


80
00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:18.298 line:-2 align:center
twist two fingers
on the screen


81
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,067 line:-1
as if rotating a dial


82
00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.035 line:-2 align:center
till you reach
the desired rotor option


83
00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:24.605 line:-2 align:center
that is
the More Content rotor.


84
00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:26.573 line:-1 align:center
[VoiceOver] More content.


85
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.809 line:-2 align:center
[Nandini]
And then, swipe down or up


86
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,979 line:-2
to navigate to the next
or previous additional content


87
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,181 line:-2
available
under the VoiceOver cursor.


88
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.250 line:-1 align:center
Now, as I swipe down the cell,


89
00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:38.085 line:-2 align:center
VoiceOver will present
additional content


90
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,020 line:-1
present on it.


91
00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:41.488 line:-1 align:center
[VoiceOver] Three years, age.


92
00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.123 line:-1 align:center

94
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,128 line:-2
Happy-go-lucky,
excellent hunting dog,


95
00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:49.863 line:-2 align:center
and loyal companion.
Description.


96
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,033 line:-2
[Nandini] Let's see how the
macOS version of the same app


97
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,004 line:-2
works after implementing
AXCustomContent API on it.


98
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.540 line:-2 align:center
[VoiceOver] Bailey, beagle.
More content available.


99
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,241 line:-2
[Nandini]
Once the VoiceOver cursor


100
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,243 line:-2
is on the element
with more content,


101
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.146 line:-2 align:center
we can bring up the rotor
with VO + command + /


102
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,348 line:-1
to reveal its custom content.


103
00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:11.818 line:-2 align:center
[VoiceOver] More Content menu.
Five items.


104
00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:15.022 line:-2 align:center
Age, three years.
Popularity, number one.


105
00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.157 line:-1 align:center
Weight, 25 pounds.


106
00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:19.226 line:-1 align:center
Height, 14 inches.


107
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,094 line:-1
Description, happy-go-lucky,


108
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,931 line:-2
excellent hunting dog,
and loyal companion.


109
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,233 line:-2
[Nandini]
In iOS, to get notified


110
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,669 line:-2
when VoiceOver element
has additional content,


111
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,539 line:-2
go to VoiceOver preferences
and open Verbosity settings.


112
00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:36.677 line:-2 align:center
Under Verbosity settings,
select More Content.


113
00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.682 line:-2 align:center
And choose either
to speak hints,


114
00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.517 line:-1 align:center
play sound,


115
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,586 line:-2
or change pitch
to get notified


116
00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:47.421 line:-2 align:center
when additional
content is available.


117
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,990 line:-2
Similarly,
you can set the verbosity


118
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:53,527 line:-2
of more content available
announcement in macOS as well.


119
00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:57.097 line:-2 align:center
You can do this using
VoiceOver Utility preferences.


120
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:00,267 line:-2
Now, let's see how we can
make our Woof Woof Kennel app


121
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,370 line:-2
support Accessibility
Custom Content API.


122
00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:06.073 line:-2 align:center
Here, we have
the DogTableViewCell


123
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:09,309 line:-1
with variables for dog photo,


124
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,579 line:-2
name,
type, description,


125
00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:16.350 line:-2 align:center
popularity, age,
weight, and height.


126
00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:20.554 line:-2 align:center
To implement
AXCustomContent API,


127
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,390 line:-2
we first import
Accessibility framework.


128
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.293 line:-2 align:center
Then we need to
add and implement


129
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,364 line:-2
AXCustomContentProvider Protocol
on our TableViewCell.


130
00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:33.967 line:-2 align:center
Before implementing
the protocol methods,


131
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,637 line:-2
let's override
accessibilityLabel property


132
00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:40.407 line:-2 align:center
and return just the name
and the type of the dog,


133
00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:42.976 line:-2 align:center
as they are the most
relevant details here.


134
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,214 line:-2
We then implement
AXCustomContentProvider


135
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:50,384 line:-2
protocol method
accessibilityCustomContent


136
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,021 line:-2
with an array of
AXCustomContent objects


137
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,089 line:-1
where AXCustomContent objects


138
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,825 line:-2
are a key-value pair
of localized strings.


139
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:03,864 line:-2
Here we create AXCustomContent
object for description


140
00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:06.600 line:-2 align:center
with string "Description"
as the label


141
00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:08.435 line:-1 align:center
and description's text value


142
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,839 line:-2
as the value of
the AXCustomContent object.


143
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,142 line:-2
We then also create
AXCustomContent objects


144
00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:17.578 line:-1 align:center
for popularity, age,


145
00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:20.147 line:-1 align:center
weight, and height as well.


146
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:24,218 line:-2
We then return an array of all
these AXCustomContent objects


147
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,986 line:-2
in the order
you want VoiceOver


148
00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:28.055 line:-2 align:center
to present them
to your user.


149
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,924 line:-2
Now, let's see how
the VoiceOver experience


150
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,793 line:-2
has improved
after implementing


151
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,262 line:-2
AXCustomContentProvider
protocol


152
00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:36.997 line:-1 align:center
on our TableViewCell.


153
00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:39.900 line:-2 align:center
[VoiceOver] Bailey, beagle.
More content available.


154
00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.368 line:-1 align:center

25 pounds, weight.


156
00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:45.873 line:-1 align:center
14 inches, height.


157
00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:47.808 line:-2 align:center
Happy-go-lucky,
excellent hunting dog,

00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,810 line:-2
and loyal companion,
description.


159
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,846 line:-2
[Nandini] For a user who is
trying to browse this list,


160
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,949 line:-2
the age of the dog might be
a crucial information for them


161
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,918 line:-1
if they want to adopt it.


162
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:02,256 line:-2
Currently, its value is hidden
behind the More Content rotor.


163
00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:05.826 line:-2 align:center
AXCustomContent object has
a property named "importance"


164
00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:08.228 line:-2 align:center
that can be used
to solve this problem.


165
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,898 line:-2
We can set this property's
value to "high,"


166
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,133 line:-2
and the content
will always be presented


167
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,402 line:-2
when VoiceOver
focuses on the element


168
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,572 line:-2
without cycling through
the additional elements.


169
00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.574 line:-2 align:center
To ensure that the age
of the dog


170
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,809 line:-2
is always presented
by VoiceOver,


171
00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:24.611 line:-2 align:center
we have set
the importance property


172
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,481 line:-2
on the age custom content
object to be "high."


173
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.085 line:-2 align:center
Now, here we see
that the age of the dog


174
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,221 line:-1
is always read by VoiceOver.


175
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,789 line:-2
[VoiceOver] Bailey, beagle,
three years.


176
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,091 line:-1
More content available.


177
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,661 line:-2
[Nandini] This age information
will also be available


178
00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:42.429 line:-1 align:center
in your More Content rotor.


179
00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:44.498 line:-1 align:center
New this year is that


180
00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:47.835 line:-2 align:center
we support the same capability
with SwiftUI as well.


181
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:49.102 line:-1 align:center
We can set


182
00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:51.271 line:-2 align:center
the accessibilityCustomContent
modifier


183
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,373 line:-2
on our custom views
in SwiftUI


184
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.777 line:-2 align:center
by passing in localizable
text for both label


185
00:07:56.844 --> 00:07:58.445 line:-1 align:center
and the value parameters


186
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:01,481 line:-2
and set the importance
property as needed.


187
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,483 line:-2
This way works well
in situations


188
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,987 line:-2
where the custom content value
is added in one place


189
00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:10.524 line:-2 align:center
and not manipulated later
in the hierarchy.


190
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:12.893 line:-2 align:center
To implement this
in our DogCell View,


191
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.829 line:-2 align:center
we first set the accessibility
hidden modifiers


192
00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.731 line:-1 align:center
on description text


193
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,734 line:-2
and on the HStack
that contains popularity,


194
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,403 line:-2
age, weight,
and height of the dog


195
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.706 line:-2 align:center
so that these aren't
automatically picked up


196
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,408 line:-2
for the accessibility
label of the DogCell.


197
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,576 line:-1
We then set


198
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,312 line:-2
accessibilityCustomContent
modifiers for age


199
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,249 line:-2
with importance set
to high, popularity,


200
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,285 line:-2
weight, height,
and description.


201
00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:40.187 line:-2 align:center
If we want
our custom content value


202
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,489 line:-2
to be manipulated
in more than one place


203
00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:44.324 line:-1 align:center
in the Swift UI hierarchy,


204
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,660 line:-2
we can avoid redefinition
of the key


205
00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:50.631 line:-2 align:center
by creating an extension of
AccessibilityCustomContentKey.


206
00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:52.933 line:-2 align:center
This will give the ability
to update


207
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.935 line:-2 align:center
or remove
the value for that key


208
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,804 line:-2
without recreating
the localizable text string.


209
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,940 line:-1
In our DogCell example,


210
00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:01.508 line:-2 align:center
we have created
an extension of


211
00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:03.544 line:-1 align:center
AccessibilityCustomContentKey


212
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.780 line:-2 align:center
and added age as one
of the custom keys.


213
00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:08.949 line:-1 align:center
On the DogCell body's VStack,


214
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:12,019 line:-2
we have added accessibility
CustomContent modifier


215
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,621 line:-2
with the
AccessibilityCustomContentKey


216
00:09:14.688 --> 00:09:17.658 line:-2 align:center
"age," instead of using
a string key here.


217
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,661 line:-2
Finally, here is what
we hope you will do


218
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,663 line:-2
to tailor
the VoiceOver experience


219
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,264 line:-1
of our data-rich apps.


220
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:28,168 line:-2
First, identify visually
data-rich parts of your app.


221
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,104 line:-2
Turn on VoiceOver
and determine if the content


222
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:34.708 line:-2 align:center
under the VoiceOver cursor
is too verbose.


223
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,376 line:-1
If it is verbose,


224
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,213 line:-2
implement
AXCustomContentProvider protocol


225
00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:42.516 line:-2 align:center
and consider moving
the supplementary information


226
00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:45.219 line:-1 align:center
to accessibilityCustomContent.


227
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,588 line:-2
Set the importance property
to "high"


228
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:51,258 line:-2
for the information you always
want to present to your user.


229
00:09:51.325 --> 00:09:54.161 line:-2 align:center
For the VoiceOver users,
to have an option


230
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,697 line:-2
to access their content
in measured portions


231
00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.832 line:-2 align:center
and have the content
presented to them


232
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,535 line:-2
only when they need it
will greatly improve


233
00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:04.037 line:-2 align:center
the Accessibility
experience of your app.


234
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,773 line:-2
So now, to give
a better experience


235
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,442 line:-1
to our VoiceOver users,


236
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:10.410 line:-2 align:center
I really encourage you
to take a look


237
00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:12.112 line:-1 align:center
at how you can incorporate


238
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,816 line:-2
AXCustomContent APIs
into your data-rich apps!


239
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:17,584 line:-1
And thank you so much


240
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,052 line:-2
for watching this session,
everyone.


241
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.220 line:-1 align:center
Bye-bye!


242
