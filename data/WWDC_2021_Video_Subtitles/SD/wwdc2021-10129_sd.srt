[Lucy] My name is Lucy Zhang,
and I'm a software engineer


4
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,615 line:-2
on the Installation
and Software Update team.


5
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,717 line:-2
I'll be talking about
managed software updates


6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,287 line:-2
for macOS,
iOS, and iPadOS today.


7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,623 line:-2
Software updates are
critical to everyone


8
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,324 line:-1
using Apple products.


9
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,793 line:-2
Updates bring new security
enhancements,


10
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,496 line:-2
like notarization
and the sealed system volume


11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,331 line:-1
in macOS Big Sur.


12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,267 line:-2
They enable
all the latest features,


13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,369 line:-1
and maybe most importantly,


14
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,038 line:-2
that's how you get
all the new emojis.


15
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.208 line:-2 align:center
Our platform makes it easy
to update your device.


16
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,912 line:-2
In fact,
86% of all iPhones introduced


17
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,682 line:-2
in the last four years
use iOS 14.


18
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,118 line:-2
However,
in managed environments,


19
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:54.021 line:-2 align:center
you need more control
over this process.


20
00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.490 line:-2 align:center
When managing a fleet
of devices,


21
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,525 line:-2
you want to keep them
up to date,


22
00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.328 line:-2 align:center
but you need time to test
updates before releasing them,


23
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:05.799 line:-2 align:center
to ensure that the OS is
compatible with your software.


24
00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.902 line:-2 align:center
After your testing is complete,
you want to ensure that


25
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,305 line:-2
updates are installed
as soon as possible,


26
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:14,274 line:-2
while minimizing disruption
to the user.


27
00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:16.577 line:-2 align:center
In this session,
we will first explore


28
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,680 line:-2
the programs and restrictions
that allow you to test


29
00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:23.083 line:-2 align:center
beta and newly released
software updates.


30
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,687 line:-2
Next, the MDM commands
for deploying updates.


31
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.989 line:-2 align:center
And finally,
I can't wait to tell you about


32
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,758 line:-2
a new way you can ensure
users get updated


33
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,028 line:-2
to the latest version
you're ready to support.


34
00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:38.365 line:-2 align:center
Let's get started
with testing updates.


35
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:42,402 line:-2
When Apple releases a beta OS,
you have time and tools to test


36
00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:45.672 line:-2 align:center
the OS in your environment
before it's released.


37
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,909 line:-2
AppleSeed for IT help
you access and test


38
00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.712 line:-2 align:center
new Apple software
while it's in beta.


39
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:55,749 line:-2
Any non-student Managed Apple ID
from Apple School Manager


40
00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:59.453 line:-2 align:center
or Apple Business Manager
can participate in the program,


41
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,222 line:-2
which gives you access
to pre-release Apple software


42
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,091 line:-1
for testing in your environment,


43
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:07.995 line:-2 align:center
and includes detailed test plans
and a way to provide feedback.


44
00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:10.163 line:-2 align:center
Once the update
is publicly released,


45
00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:12.132 line:-1 align:center
you may still need time to test,


46
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,368 line:-2
and you don't want
the update to be available


47
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:16.436 line:-1 align:center
to all your users yet.


48
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,572 line:-1
For that, you have deferral.


49
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,974 line:-2
Deferral prevents
supervised devices


50
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,677 line:-2
from offering
software updates to users,


51
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.647 line:-2 align:center
until a specified period of time
has expired


52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,317 line:-2
since those updates
were published by Apple.


53
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.619 line:-2 align:center
When you
apply a deferral restriction,


54
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,356 line:-2
the default delay is 30 days
since update publication.


55
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.694 line:-2 align:center
You can also specify a custom
value between 1 and 90 days.


56
00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:42.863 line:-2 align:center
When an update has been
available long enough


57
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,265 line:-2
for the specified delay
to expire,


58
00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.135 line:-2 align:center
that update is offered
to users as part of the standard


59
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.971 line:-2 align:center
software update notifications
and update process.


60
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,874 line:-2
These restrictions give you
more granular control


61
00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:58.612 line:-2 align:center
over the Software Update
interface in System Preferences.


62
00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.914 line:-2 align:center
The deferred updates
restriction only affects


63
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,749 line:-1
the Software Update interface.


64
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,953 line:-2
It does not change
the behavior of MDM commands.


65
00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:09.122 line:-2 align:center
Even with a restriction set,
MDM has the ability


66
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:12,726 line:-2
to send specific updates
to devices.


67
00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.897 line:-2 align:center
For iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV,
deferring software updates


68
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,700 line:-2
is available
in iOS 11.3 or later,


69
00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:22.135 line:-1 align:center
iPadOS 13.1 or later,


70
00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.372 line:-1 align:center
and tvOS 12.2 or later.


71
00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:28.675 line:-2 align:center
When you defer updates,
you set the same deferral window


72
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,812 line:-1
for major and minor updates.


73
00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:34.815 line:-2 align:center
For Mac computers,
deferring software updates


74
00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:38.151 line:-2 align:center
is available
in macOS 10.13 or later.


75
00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:42.756 line:-2 align:center
In macOS 11.3 or later,
an admin may now choose to delay


76
00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.759 line:-2 align:center
major releases for longer
than minor releases.


77
00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.228 line:-2 align:center
That way, users can still
benefit from


78
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:51,131 line:-2
important security updates,
while the admin works


79
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,967 line:-2
to approve the latest
major release for production


80
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,303 line:-1
in their environment.


81
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,572 line:-2
These are the keys that you
can set in a profile


82
00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:00.741 line:-1 align:center
to install on the Mac computer.


83
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,210 line:-2
Use the
forceDelayedMajorSoftwareUpdates


84
00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.946 line:-2 align:center
key to defer
a major release.


85
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,649 line:-2
With this key,
you can still receive minor OS


86
00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:12.553 line:-2 align:center
and security updates, while
deferring a major OS update.


87
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,988 line:-2
There may be times where
you want to separately


88
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,758 line:-2
defer a minor release,
and you'll use


89
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:20.761 line:-2 align:center
the forceDelayedSoftwareUpdates
key to do that.


90
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,196 line:-2
And for separately
deferring


91
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,198 line:0
supplemental updates,
you'll use the


92
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:27,000 align:center
forceDelayedAppSoftwareUpdates
key.


93
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:30,404 align:center
If a deferral type is enabled,
but there is no corresponding


94
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,207 line:0
deferral period set,
we will fallback to using


95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,010 line:0
the old key,
ManagedDeferredInstallDelay.


96
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,646 line:-2
When there are deferral
restrictions in place,


97
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.715 line:-2 align:center
this is how the software
update preference pane


98
00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.150 line:-1 align:center
appears on macOS.


99
00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:46.220 line:-2 align:center
Let's explore how
deferral might work.


100
00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:48.722 line:-2 align:center
Back to the timeline,
you've now deferred


101
00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:51.291 line:-2 align:center
an update
and continued testing the new OS


102
00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:53.694 line:-2 align:center
for compatibility
in your environment.


103
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,697 line:-2
Once you've confirmed the OS
and completed testing,


104
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.699 line:-2 align:center
you're ready to push it
to users.


105
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,201 line:-2
You want devices to update
when users are ready,


106
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,804 line:-2
and it's not intrusive
to their workflow.


107
00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:06.440 line:-2 align:center
So let's explore
deploying updates.


108
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,942 line:-2
There are a few steps
to install the right update


109
00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:11.745 line:-2 align:center
on the right device,
and with macOS Monterey,


110
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,883 line:-2
there's more parity than ever
before between macOS and iOS.


111
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:19,186 line:-2
The first step in deploying
updates for all platforms


112
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:22,990 line:-2
is to check for updates
and confirm device eligibility.


113
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,994 line:-2
Here's how that was done for Mac
prior to macOS Monterey.


114
00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:30.097 line:-2 align:center
Available OS updates
were only able to be


115
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,599 line:-1
evaluated on the user's device.


116
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,636 line:-2
You used the command
ScheduleOSUpdateScan,


117
00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.738 line:-2 align:center
which tells the Mac
to query the server


118
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:41,275 line:-2
for available OS updates,
and then evaluates the updates


119
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,310 line:-1
to determine eligibility.


120
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:47.080 line:-2 align:center
Once the scan finished and was
sent back to the MDM server,


121
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:50,150 line:-2
the MDM could then choose
an update to deploy.


122
00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:54.321 line:-2 align:center
However, Apple provides the
Apple Software Lookup service,


123
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.257 line:-2 align:center
which provides
a list of available OS versions


124
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,159 line:-1
across platforms.


125
00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:02.162 line:-2 align:center
Here, we are presented
with the iOS devices.


126
00:06:02.196 --> 00:06:04.698 line:-2 align:center
You may already be using
the feed for iPhone


127
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.601 line:-2 align:center
and iPad to reduce
the back-and-forth that comes


128
00:06:07.634 --> 00:06:09.970 line:-2 align:center
with the ScheduleOSUpdateScan
for Mac.


129
00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:13.473 line:-2 align:center
For iOS, MDM solutions
use the


130
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,810 line:-2
Apple Software Lookup Service
to be aware of available updates


131
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,646 line:-2
to push the command
directly to the device.


132
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.148 line:-1 align:center
Here's how:


133
00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:23.283 line:-2 align:center
First, the MDM Server
can get a list


134
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:27,754 line:-2
of available updates,
such as 12.1 or 12.2,


135
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,290 line:-2
from the Apple Software
Lookup Service.


136
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:33,260 line:-2
When you're ready to deploy
an update, the MDM server


137
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:36,163 line:-2
will send the update
version to the device.


138
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,866 line:-2
Then, the device will reach
the software update server


139
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,101 line:-2
to verify that
the update is eligible


140
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,538 line:-2
and begin
to download and install it.


141
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:47.808 line:-2 align:center
New with macOS Monterey,
we are unifying this process


142
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,744 line:-1
for macOS and iOS.


143
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,914 line:-2
We now support a new
DeviceInformation query key


144
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,116 line:-1
called SoftwareUpdateModelID,


145
00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.819 line:-2 align:center
which returns the hardware
model string for iOS


146
00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:00.954 line:-1 align:center
and macOS to MDM.


147
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:04,024 line:-2
The Apple Software Lookup
Service will include


148
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,994 line:-2
the appropriate hardware
identifier for macOS,


149
00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:10.430 line:-2 align:center
allowing MDM servers
to determine the applicability


150
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:13,500 line:-2
of an update without
the AvailableOSUpdates command.


151
00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:16.603 line:-2 align:center
Just like on iOS,
the MDM will be able


152
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,672 line:-2
to determine
update applicability


153
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,808 line:-2
by comparing the result from
DeviceInformation query


154
00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:25.312 line:-2 align:center
to the device IDs
listed in the JSON feed.


155
00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:29.550 line:-2 align:center
Also, until now, macOS has
ignored the ProductVersion key


156
00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:31.485 line:-1 align:center
and used ProductKey instead.


157
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:34,254 line:-2
As of macOS Monterey,
the ProductVersion key


158
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,456 line:-1
will be supported on macOS.


159
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,693 line:-2
iOS already uses this
key to specify updates.


160
00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:42.996 line:-2 align:center
For compatibility, if you
specify both ProductVersion


161
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,567 line:-2
and ProductKey,
then ProductKey will be used.


162
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,769 line:-2
If the device can't find
an update eligible


163
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,506 line:-2
for that version, it will send
the appropriate response.


164
00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:55.576 line:-2 align:center
This removes the round
trip for minor OS updates


165
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,578 line:-2
as long as you have
previously collected


166
00:07:57.611 --> 00:08:00.681 line:-2 align:center
the supported device ID
of the device.


167
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,550 line:-2
MDM administrators can
automatically install


168
00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:06.887 line:-2 align:center
and authorize software
updates for macOS, iOS,


169
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,657 line:-2
and iPadOS, as long as
the device is supervised.


170
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:13,927 line:-2
In macOS 11 or later,
all Mac computers enrolled


171
00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:15.829 line:-1 align:center
using either Device Enrollment


172
00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:19.366 line:-2 align:center
or Automated Device Enrollment
are supervised.


173
00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:22.970 line:-2 align:center
For iOS and iPadOS,
the user will be required


174
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,139 line:-2
to enter their passcode
to proceed with the update.


175
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,141 line:-1
Mac computers with Apple silicon


176
00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:30.744 line:-2 align:center
introduce the concept
of "ownership."


177
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,413 line:-2
Ownership can
loosely be defined as the user


178
00:08:33.447 --> 00:08:37.050 line:-2 align:center
who has first claimed a Mac
for configuring it for their use


179
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:41,421 line:-2
and is not tied to true legal
ownership or chain of custody.


180
00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:44.424 line:-2 align:center
Ownership defines who is
authorized to make changes


181
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,962 line:-2
to the startup security policy
for a specific install of macOS.


182
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:52,366 line:-2
On Apple silicon,
the startup security policy


183
00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:54.801 line:-2 align:center
defines the restrictions
around which versions


184
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:58,438 line:-2
of macOS can boot on Mac
computers and permission


185
00:08:58.472 --> 00:09:02.042 line:-2 align:center
to use the bootstrap token
for automated updates.


186
00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:05.679 line:-2 align:center
macOS requires authentication
to perform updates.


187
00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.981 line:-2 align:center
For Mac computers
with Apple silicon,


188
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,684 line:-2
authentication requires
a user password


189
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.653 line:-1 align:center
or an MDM bootstrap token.


190
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:15,322 line:-2
A user password is required
for user-initiated,


191
00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:17.991 line:-2 align:center
interactive updates through
System Preferences.


192
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,061 line:-2
An MDM Bootstrap Token
is used for automated


193
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,729 line:-1
non-interactive updates,


194
00:09:22.763 --> 00:09:25.532 line:-2 align:center
which requires macOS 11.2
or later,


195
00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:29.736 line:-2 align:center
and the update being installed
must be signed by Apple.


196
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.973 line:-2 align:center
New in macOS Monterey,
we have introduced support


197
00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:34.541 line:-1 align:center
for the bootstrap token


198
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:38,245 line:-2
for MDM-initiated
install-later flows.


199
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,415 line:-2
This means that Apple silicon
devices can schedule


200
00:09:41.448 --> 00:09:43.283 line:-2 align:center
and perform updates
at a later time,


201
00:09:43.317 --> 00:09:45.686 line:-1 align:center
when the device is not in use.


202
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,821 line:-2
Your users will appreciate
that you're updating


203
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:50,490 line:-2
their device while not
disrupting their workflow.


204
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:54,094 line:-2
They can just wake up the next
day to an updated machine.


205
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,663 line:-2
If you're already supporting
the bootstrap token,


206
00:09:56.697 --> 00:09:58.332 line:-2 align:center
this will just start
working when you use


207
00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:02.402 line:-2 align:center
the InstallLater action
in ScheduleOSUpdate.


208
00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:06.340 line:-2 align:center
Once the MDM knows which
update is applicable to devices,


209
00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:09.142 line:-2 align:center
the ScheduleOSUpdate
command is used to deploy


210
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:12,813 line:-2
the update to macOS, iOS,
and iPadOS.


211
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,382 line:-2
Just note,
an MDM command can be used


212
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:19,119 line:-2
to install the update during
the deferral window or after.


213
00:10:19.152 --> 00:10:21.355 line:-2 align:center
There are several options
when using


214
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,490 line:-1
the ScheduleOSUpdate command.


215
00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:26.760 line:-2 align:center
One option that must be set
is the install action,


216
00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.595 line:-2 align:center
whose value
significantly affects


217
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,797 line:-1
the behavior of the update.


218
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:34,101 line:-2
The InstallASAP install action
is the primary


219
00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:37.538 line:-2 align:center
update mechanism
for userless macOS devices.


220
00:10:37.571 --> 00:10:40.440 line:-2 align:center
InstallASAP
uses the bootstrap token


221
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:44,077 line:-2
for authentication on Mac
computers with Apple silicon.


222
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,246 line:-2
This action
performs immediately,


223
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.949 line:-2 align:center
with an option for a user
to cancel the update.


224
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:53,086 line:-2
Just note that InstallASAP
command does not automatically


225
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.556 line:-2 align:center
close applications that are
actively in use


226
00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:58.792 line:-2 align:center
unless the InstallForceResart
option is used.


227
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:03,430 line:-2
DownloadOnly is useful for both
users and userless devices


228
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,165 line:-2
to download
the update in the background


229
00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:07.568 line:-1 align:center
before the installation time.


230
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:10,704 line:-2
NotifyOnly is used to alert
users that there is


231
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,639 line:-1
an action for installation.


232
00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:15.175 line:-2 align:center
Neither command will
start the install.


233
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,144 line:-2
InstallLater allows you
to schedule


234
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,046 line:-1
an Install Tonight update.


235
00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:21.215 line:-2 align:center
The device will choose
a window of time,


236
00:11:21.248 --> 00:11:23.650 line:-2 align:center
usually between
2:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m.,


237
00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:26.286 line:-2 align:center
based on machine learning,
using conditions such as


238
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.155 line:-1 align:center
when the device is least used,


239
00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.823 line:-1 align:center
for the install to occur.


240
00:11:29.857 --> 00:11:32.226 line:-2 align:center
The device then schedules
the update to occur


241
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,495 line:-2
in that window of time, given
that you are plugged into power.


242
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,965 line:-2
Let's check
out the notifications.


243
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:41,301 line:-2
With the InstallASAP command,
or Default command,


244
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:44,371 line:-2
users can get a restart
countdown notification.


245
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,940 line:-2
The user can choose
to cancel the restart


246
00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:49.376 line:-1 align:center
in the notification options.


247
00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:52.646 line:-2 align:center
And in macOS Monterey,
when you use InstallLater,


248
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,748 line:-2
the user
will get this notification.


249
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:58,185 line:-1
Let's examine this more closely.


250
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,354 line:-2
This notification shows
that the update


251
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,556 line:-2
will attempt to install
that night.


252
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,958 line:-2
The user is reminded that
the device must be connected


253
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:08,195 line:-2
to power at the time it
performs the update later.


254
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,232 line:-1
For iOS or iPadOS devices,


255
00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:14.868 line:-2 align:center
Default
is the primary update mechanism.


256
00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:17.171 line:-2 align:center
DownloadOnly
is useful for both user


257
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,840 line:-2
and userless devices
to install the download


258
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:22,910 line:-2
in the background
before the installation time.


259
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,445 line:-2
Here is what a user
would be presented with.


260
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,215 line:-2
Non-passcode-protected
devices install the version


261
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.618 line:-2 align:center
immediately after the command
is sent from the MDM server.


262
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:33,420 line:-2
Passcode-protected devices
require


263
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,988 line:-1
a slightly different flow.


264
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:38,492 line:-2
Once the device receives
the install command from MDM,


265
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,360 line:-2
we will schedule
the installation alert


266
00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:41.962 line:-1 align:center
to show on the next unlock.


267
00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:44.865 line:-2 align:center
This gives the user
the option to Install Now,


268
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,233 line:-1
or Install Tonight,


269
00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.202 line:-1 align:center
or Remind Me Later.


270
00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:51.471 line:-2 align:center
On iOS, this first install alert
shown to the user


271
00:12:51.505 --> 00:12:55.709 line:-2 align:center
allows you to choose Install
Now, Later, or Details.


272
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,245 line:-2
Subsequent alerts shown
will say that the update


273
00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.479 line:-1 align:center
is ready to install.


274
00:12:59.513 --> 00:13:03.116 line:-2 align:center
For example, "iOS 15.0 is ready
to install."


275
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:07,187 line:-2
And the provided options
are Install Now or Later.


276
00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:09.223 line:-2 align:center
Tapping Later
in the previous screen


277
00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:10.657 line:-1 align:center
will show the passcode prompt


278
00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:13.994 line:-2 align:center
with the Remind Me Later
option at the bottom.


279
00:13:14.027 --> 00:13:17.531 line:-2 align:center
The MDM server can also
flag an update as required.


280
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,700 line:-2
This will let the user choose
Remind Me Later


281
00:13:19.733 --> 00:13:22.803 line:-1 align:center
a maximum of three times.


282
00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:25.339 line:-2 align:center
After the third tap
of Remind Me Later,


283
00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:27.241 line:-2 align:center
the installation
notification will be shown


284
00:13:27.274 --> 00:13:29.610 line:-2 align:center
every time the user
hits the Home screen,


285
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,846 line:-2
and the Remind Me Later
option is removed.


286
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,382 align:center
Let's return to the timeline
where we're now ready


287
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,317 align:center
to install the update.


288
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:39,653 align:center
For userless devices,
you can use


289
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:43,223 align:center
the InstallForceRestart option
with ScheduleOSUpdate.


290
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:46,793 line:0
Those devices will do a hard
restart to perform the update.


291
00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:50.330 line:-2 align:center
And for user devices, once you
send the install command,


292
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,833 line:-2
you relied on the user
to perform the update.


293
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.402 line:-1 align:center
That is, until now.


294
00:13:55.435 --> 00:13:58.005 line:-2 align:center
I'm excited to tell you
about a new feature


295
00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:00.140 line:-1 align:center
we are introducing for macOS.


296
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,177 line:-2
After the admin update
deferral period is over,


297
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,646 line:-2
you want to ensure that
updates are installed quickly


298
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,081 line:-2
after you've made
them available to users.


299
00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:10.417 line:-2 align:center
You don't want the user
to continue to cancel


300
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.952 line:-1 align:center
or defer the update.


301
00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:13.820 line:-1 align:center
You need a way to enforce it.


302
00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:17.691 line:-2 align:center
In macOS Monterey,
you now gain more control


303
00:14:17.724 --> 00:14:21.461 line:-2 align:center
over the InstallLater policy
to enforce the update.


304
00:14:21.495 --> 00:14:23.897 line:-2 align:center
You can specify the number
of times the device


305
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:27,634 line:-2
should prompt to install
before the update is enforced.


306
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:31,638 line:-2
This number is defined by
the MaxUserDeferrals key.


307
00:14:31.672 --> 00:14:35.309 line:-2 align:center
This MaxUserDeferrals key
implies the existing key,


308
00:14:35.342 --> 00:14:38.245 line:-2 align:center
InstallForceRestart,
once the maximum number


309
00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:40.781 line:-1 align:center
of deferrals has been reached.


310
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,617 line:-2
When you enforce the number
of maximum deferrals,


311
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,420 line:-2
the user will receive
informative notifications


312
00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:48.755 line:-2 align:center
about the remaining
number of attempts left


313
00:14:48.789 --> 00:14:51.592 line:-2 align:center
before a forced update
will occur.


314
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,361 line:-2
To change the maximum
number of user deferrals,


315
00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:58.565 line:-2 align:center
you simply need to issue
a new InstallLater command.


316
00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:00.968 line:-2 align:center
Here's what the user
would be presented with.


317
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,403 line:-2
When you
set the MaxUserDeferrals value,


318
00:15:03.437 --> 00:15:05.906 line:-2 align:center
the notification shows
the remaining number of attempts


319
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,941 line:-1
before a forced install.


320
00:15:07.975 --> 00:15:09.643 line:-2 align:center
The update
is scheduled for tonight,


321
00:15:09.676 --> 00:15:12.646 line:-1 align:center
but the user is given options.


322
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,648 line:-2
They can
select Remind Me Tomorrow,


323
00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:16.683 line:-2 align:center
which will defer the update
again and decrement


324
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:19,453 line:-2
the count of remaining
number of attempts.


325
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,022 line:-2
They can install it now,
or they can have it


326
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,724 line:-1
attempt to update later tonight.


327
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,425 line:-2
If the user does nothing,
the update


328
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,528 line:-1
will attempt that night.


329
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:30.531 line:-2 align:center
When the number of maximum
user deferrals is reached,


330
00:15:30.564 --> 00:15:33.700 line:-2 align:center
the user is notified
that this update will be forced.


331
00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:36.770 line:-2 align:center
This means the machine will
restart to perform the update,


332
00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:40.707 line:-2 align:center
regardless if the user
is still using the device.


333
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:44,011 align:center
With these new changes,
admins gain more control


334
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,847 line:0
over enforcing the macOS
update and ensuring that


335
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,183 align:center
devices are updated
in a timely manner.


336
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,253 line:-2
There is one more thing
I want to tell you


337
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,422 line:-1
about managing software updates.


338
00:15:55,455 --> 00:16:00,260 line:-2
New this year, iOS and iPadOS
now offer users a choice


339
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,296 line:-2
between two
software update versions


340
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:03.897 line:-1 align:center
within the Settings app.


341
00:16:03.931 --> 00:16:06.700 line:-2 align:center
For example, you can update
to the next major OS


342
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,336 line:-2
as soon as it's released,
for the latest features


343
00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:11.738 line:-2 align:center
and most complete set
of security updates.


344
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:15,609 line:-2
Alternatively, continue on
the current major release


345
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,212 line:-2
and still get important
security updates,


346
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,781 line:-2
until you're ready to jump to
the next major version


347
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,383 line:-1
of iOS or iPadOS.


348
00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:26.053 line:-2 align:center
A new option on the Settings
command lets you control


349
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,755 line:-2
what OS update is
presented to the user.


350
00:16:28.789 --> 00:16:31.859 line:-2 align:center
You specify this by providing
a SoftwareUpdateSettings


351
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:35,829 line:-2
dictionary, which has a key
called RecommendationCadence.


352
00:16:35.863 --> 00:16:38.699 line:-1 align:center
This key can have three values.


353
00:16:38.732 --> 00:16:42.269 line:-2 align:center
Here's what's shown if you have
RecommendationCadence set to 0.


354
00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:45.005 line:-2 align:center
This is the default view,
which is what you would get


355
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,641 line:-2
if no MDM restrictions
are in place.


356
00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.676 line:-2 align:center
Both the major and minor
versions


357
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,678 line:-1
of updates are available.


358
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:55,482 line:-2
Here's what's shown if you have
RecommendationCadence set to 1.


359
00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:57.985 line:-2 align:center
If two software update versions
are available,


360
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,287 line:-2
the device will show the
software update version


361
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,656 line:-1
with the lower version number.


362
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:06.226 line:-2 align:center
Here's what's shown if you have
RecommendationCadence set to 2.


363
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.529 line:-2 align:center
If two software update versions
are available,


364
00:17:08.562 --> 00:17:10.330 line:-2 align:center
the device will show
the software update


365
00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:12.499 line:-1 align:center
with the higher version number.


366
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:15,802 line:-2
Just note, if a deferral
is set with the existing


367
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,105 line:-1
enforceSoftwareDelayUpdate key,


368
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,940 line:-2
the device will take that
into account


369
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,676 line:-2
and filter by
the RecommendationCadence.


370
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,479 line:-2
The two update choices
will eventually converge.


371
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,918 line:-2
To recap, on macOS, we will now
support deploying updates


372
00:17:30.951 --> 00:17:34.121 line:-2 align:center
using an OS version
so MDMs can determine


373
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,223 line:-2
what updates are needed
for devices


374
00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:38.592 line:-2 align:center
and push them
in a timely manner.


375
00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:41.195 line:-2 align:center
We have also automated
InstallLater flows


376
00:17:41.228 --> 00:17:42.996 line:-2 align:center
on Mac computers
with Apple silicon


377
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,165 line:-1
using the bootstrap token.


378
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:49,269 line:-2
We will allow the MDM to enforce
updates with MaxUserDeferrals,


379
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:51,438 line:-2
allowing for users
to stay informed about


380
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,041 line:-2
when updates occur,
and scheduling updates


381
00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:57.578 line:-2 align:center
at times least likely
to disrupt their workflows.


382
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,781 line:-2
Finally, on iOS,
we have added support to manage


383
00:18:00.814 --> 00:18:03.717 line:-2 align:center
what versions of updates
are shown in Settings.


384
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,453 line:-2
We look forward to you
gaining this additional control


385
00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:08.488 line:-2 align:center
and providing
a great update experience


386
00:18:08.522 --> 00:18:11.859 line:-2 align:center
for users in macOS
Monterey and iOS 15.


387
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:15,062 line:-2
Thank you,
and have a great WWDC.
