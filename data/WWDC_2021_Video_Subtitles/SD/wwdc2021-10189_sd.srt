00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,813 line:-1
And I work on media playback


8
00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:15.449 line:-1 position:50%
in WebKit and Safari
here at Apple.


9
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,318 line:-1
People love watching
their favorite shows and movies


10
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,020 line:-1
and listening
to their music together,


11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,123 line:-1
whether it’s with people
in the same room, next door,


12
00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.925 line:-1 position:50%
or on the other side
of the world.


13
00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.627 line:-1 position:50%
And now with GroupActivities,


14
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,730 line:-1
it’s easier than ever to provide
a SharePlay experience


15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,900 line:-1
to your users,
wherever they are.


16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.936 line:-1 position:50%
In this session,
we'll cover four topics.


17
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:39,773 line:-1
An introduction to coordinated
playback in Safari;


18
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:44,611 line:-1
how to prepare your iOS app to
work with SharePlay in Safari;


19
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:49,449 line:-1
how to adopt the Media Session
API in your app's web page;


20
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,019 line:-1
and a new web API
for coordinating playback


21
00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.589 line:-1 position:50%
across multiple devices.


22
00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.458 line:-1 position:50%
So let’s start by talking
a little bit about SharePlay


23
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,494 line:-1
and Safari.


24
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,796 line:-1
In the previous session,
you learned how to create


25
00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:05.532 line:-1 position:50%
an amazing SharePlay experience
in your iPhone


26
00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:09.269 line:-1 position:50%
and iPad applications
with GroupActivities.


27
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,938 line:-1
And on macOS Monterey,


28
00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:12.606 line:-1 position:50%
you can bring
that same experience --


29
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,142 line:-1
along with your great iPhone
and iPad apps --


30
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,011 line:-1
to Mac using Catalyst.


31
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,781 line:-1
And if your application
has a companion website,


32
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,684 line:-1
you can bring that same amazing
SharePlay experience


33
00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:25.953 line:-1 position:50%
to your Mac Safari 15 users,


34
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,155 line:-1
without requiring those users
to download your app


35
00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:29.756 line:-1 position:50%
from the App Store.


36
00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.825 line:-1 position:50%
And that’s what I’m going
to show you how to do


37
00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.260 line:-1 position:50%
in this session.


38
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.162 line:-1 position:50%
I’ve been working
on an iPhone application


39
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,830 line:-1
that lets you watch
movie trailers.


40
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,067 line:-1
I’ve already added support
for GroupActivities to my app,


41
00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:42.703 line:-1 position:50%
and that lets friends watch
movie trailers together


42
00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:43.937 line:-1 position:50%
over FaceTime.


43
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,873 line:-1
But my movie trailers app
also has a website.


44
00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:49.343 line:-1 position:50%
And here’s how it should look
once I add support


45
00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:53.013 line:-1 position:50%
for GroupActivities
in that web page as well.


46
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,482 line:-1
I’m on a FaceTime call
with my friend Sam.


47
00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.351 line:-1 position:50%
Sam loves
watching movie trailers,


48
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,352 line:-1
so I’ve asked them


49
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,687 line:-1
to help me test this new
Movie Trailers app.


50
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,523 line:-1
When they start playing
a new trailer in that app


51
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,524 line:-1
during our call,


52
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:09,029 line:-1
I’ll be invited to watch that
trailer through a notification.


53
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:12,265 line:-1
It will give me the option
to join the session in Safari.


54
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,235 line:-1
When I click that notification,


55
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,805 line:-1
Safari will be launched with
a URL for the shared content,


56
00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.807 line:-1 position:50%
and when Sam starts
playing the trailer,


57
00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.477 line:-1 position:50%
it will play here in Safari
at the same time.


58
00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:27.114 line:-1 position:50%
I can pause, play, and even seek
the video here in Safari,


59
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,283 line:-1
and everyone else in the session
will see those same commands


60
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,453 line:-1
reflected in their local video
at the same time.


61
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,622 line:-1
It's going to be really great!


62
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,225 line:-1
So, what will it take to add
GroupActivities support


63
00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:40.193 line:-1 position:50%
to the movie trailers website?


64
00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:42.496 line:-1 position:50%
Before we take a look
under the hood of Safari --


65
00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:45.632 line:-1 position:50%
at the new Web APIs
available in Safari 15 --


66
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,801 line:-1
let's talk about how to get
your app ready to work


67
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,704 line:-1
with Safari
through GroupActivities.


68
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,706 line:-1
In order to join
a GroupActivities session


69
00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:55.909 line:-1 position:50%
with Safari, a user
with your iPhone or iPad app


70
00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.879 line:-1 position:50%
will need to create
a GroupSessionActivity


71
00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.816 line:-1 position:50%
with a fallbackURL
that points to your website.


72
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:06,053 line:-1
The fallbackURL must identify
not just your website,


73
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,989 line:-1
but the specific content
to be played.


74
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,692 line:-1
When a Watch Together invitation
is issued by an iPhone user


75
00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.327 line:-1 position:50%
to a user on a Mac,


76
00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:17.464 line:-1 position:50%
Safari will be launched
and asked to load the URL


77
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,567 line:-1
that you provide
in GroupSessionActivity.


78
00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:23.070 line:-1 position:50%
Once the fallbackURL
is loaded in Safari,


79
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.471 line:-1 position:50%
your site will need to implement


80
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,240 line:-1
a few simple
but important Web APIs.


81
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,709 line:-1
The first is Media Session.


82
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,778 line:-1
Media Session is
a standard Web API


83
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,848 line:-1
which allows your site
to tell the browser -- Safari --


84
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,217 line:-1
more about the current state
of media playback


85
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.753 line:-1 position:50%
within your page.


86
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,122 line:-1
Your site can tell the browser
the current play state,


87
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,757 line:-1
the duration of your content.


88
00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:46.827 line:-1 position:50%
It can provide artwork
for the current playback item.


89
00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:49.262 line:-1 position:50%
It can even tell the browser
that the current content


90
00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.532 line:-1 position:50%
is an advertisement
that can be skipped.


91
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,302 line:-1
Once the Browser has all
this metadata available,


92
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,538 line:-1
it can provide that metadata to
the rest of the operating system


93
00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:00.140 line:-1 position:50%
and present it to your users


94
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.409 line:-1 position:50%
outside of the browser
window itself.


95
00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.045 line:-1 position:50%
One place the operating system
displays that data


96
00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.581 line:-1 position:50%
is within something
called "Now Playing."


97
00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:10.350 line:-1 position:50%
Now Playing is a great way
for users to quickly see


98
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.787 line:-1 position:50%
and control the media
that they’re enjoying right now.


99
00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:16.423 line:-1 position:50%
In iOS, users can access
Now Playing


100
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,659 line:-1
from the Control Center
as well as from the Lock screen.


101
00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.363 line:-1 position:50%
And now in macOS Monterey,
users can access Now Playing


102
00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.332 line:-1 position:50%
directly from the menu bar.


103
00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:27.100 line:-1 position:50%
And Safari will use
the information


104
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.137 line:-1 position:50%
provided through Media Session
to populate Now Playing


105
00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:34.341 line:-1 position:50%
with your content’s title,
duration, play state, artwork,


106
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,909 line:-1
and more.


107
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,578 line:-1
Now Playing also allows users
to control playback


108
00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:39.980 line:-1 position:50%
of what they’re listening to,


109
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.083 line:-1 position:50%
by showing the user a simple set
of playback controls.


110
00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:45.318 line:-1 position:50%
Your site can register
with the Media Session


111
00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:47.454 line:-1 position:50%
for specific actions to perform


112
00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.823 line:-1 position:50%
when a user interacts
with Now Playing,


113
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,191 line:-1
so that for example,


114
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,760 line:-1
when a user taps
the Play button in Now Playing,


115
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.596 line:-1 position:50%
Safari can run
your site’s own action handler


116
00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.932 line:-1 position:50%
to begin playback.


117
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,268 line:-1
Media Session gives your site
complete control


118
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,204 line:-1
over what metadata
to expose to the browser,


119
00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:08.141 line:-1 position:50%
as well as control over how to
implement playback commands.


120
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,910 line:-1
Need to do some set up
or preflighting


121
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.711 line:-1 position:50%
before beginning playback?


122
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,679 line:-1
No problem.


123
00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:15.115 line:-1 position:50%
With mediaSession’s
play action handler,


124
00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:16.950 line:-1 position:50%
now you can.


125
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.286 line:-1 position:50%
If your site has previously
adopted Media Session,


126
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,054 line:-1
you’re halfway done already.


127
00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:24.491 line:-1 position:50%
But the movie trailers site
hasn’t adopted Media Session


128
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,661 line:-1
yet, so let’s add support
for that now.


129
00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:30.297 line:-1 position:50%
This site will want to add
actions for play,


130
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,899 line:-1
pause, and seekto.


131
00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.468 line:-1 position:50%
To do so, we’ll use
the mediaSession property


132
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,205 line:-1
of navigator.


133
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,608 line:-1
Let’s first add
an action handler for play.


134
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,611 line:-1
We’ll call mediaSession.
setActionHandler(),


135
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:47.747 line:-1 position:50%
passing in the string play
and an inline function


136
00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:50.884 line:-1 position:50%
that just calls play()
on our video element.


137
00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:56.323 line:-1 position:50%
Then, we’ll do the same
for pause and seekto.


138
00:05:56.323 --> 00:05:57.924 line:-1 position:50%
And to make sure
that we’re accurately


139
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,794 line:-1
representing playback state
to the browser,


140
00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:03.463 line:-1 position:50%
we’ll add event listeners
to our video element


141
00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:07.100 line:-1 position:50%
and update mediaSession
when that state changes.


142
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.401 line:-1 position:50%
First, let’s add a function


143
00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.171 line:-1 position:50%
called
updateMediaSessionState().


144
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,606 line:-1
It will query the video element


145
00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:16.176 line:-1 position:50%
to find out
if it’s playing or paused.


146
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,945 line:-1
Then it will set mediaSession’s
playbackState property


147
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,915 line:-1
to either the string
playing or paused,


148
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:26,152 line:-1
depending on the video element’s
playback state.


149
00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:29.489 line:-1 position:50%
Next, it will query
the video element’s duration,


150
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,858 line:-1
playback rate,
and current time.


151
00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:33.426 line:-1 position:50%
Then, using those values,


152
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,130 line:-1
it will call mediaSession’s
setPositionState() function,


153
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.001 line:-1 position:50%
passing in those values
in the dictionary parameter.


154
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,602 line:-1
Then, let’s add
an event listener


155
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,771 line:-1
to detect when
those values change,


156
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,706 line:-1
and call
updateMediaSessionState()


157
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,176 line:-1
to update mediaSession
with those new values.


158
00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:52.545 line:-1 position:50%
We’ll need an event listener

pause, duration change,
rate change, and time change.


160
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,854 position:50%
And last, because
the movie trailers website


161
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,891 line:0
has both a title string
and a URL for the title artwork,


162
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,661 position:50%
we can set the Media Session’s
metadata property


163
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:13,233 line:0
to a new MediaMetadata object
containing those values.


164
00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:16.036 line:-1 position:50%
So let’s try it out!


165
00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:20.073 line:-1 position:50%
I’ll reload my page in Safari,
begin playing,


166
00:07:20.073 --> 00:07:23.043 line:-1 position:50%
then click on the Now Playing
icon in the system menu.


167
00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:25.879 line:-1 position:50%
And I see the title and artwork
in the Now Playing panel.


168
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,614 line:-1
And when I tap the Pause button,


169
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:32,319 line:-1
our pause action handler
is called and playback pauses.


170
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,421 line:-1
Media Session provides
the building blocks


171
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:37,023 line:-1
for a Watch Together experience
in a web page,


172
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,360 line:-1
by providing a mechanism
for the browser to tell the page


173
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.229 line:-1 position:50%
it should start
or stop playback.


174
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,065 line:-1
Now we’re ready move
onto the second part


175
00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:47.934 line:-1 position:50%
of creating a cowatching
experience in our web page:


176
00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:51.705 line:-1 position:50%
coordinating playback across
every device in the session.


177
00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:54.207 line:-1 position:50%
To do so, we’ve extended
Media Session


178
00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:58.778 line:-1 position:50%
by adding a new property
on it called "Coordinator."


179
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,980 line:-1
Your page will use
Media Session's Coordinator


180
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,751 line:-1
to inform every other user in
the session of the page’s intent


181
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,087 line:-1
to begin or pause playback,


182
00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:09.956 line:-1 position:50%
to seek to a specific point
in the media’s timeline,


183
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,927 line:-1
or to move to the next item
in a playlist.


184
00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:16.529 line:-1 position:50%
The Coordinator will
communicate those intents


185
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,598 line:-1
with all the other devices
in the session


186
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,168 line:-1
and listen for changes to every
other device's play state,


187
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.770 line:-1 position:50%
resolve conflicts,


188
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,407 line:-1
and wait for everyone
to be ready to begin playback.


189
00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:28.875 line:-1 position:50%
And when everyone is ready,


190
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,878 line:-1
the Coordinator will use the
Media Session action handlers


191
00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:34.314 line:-1 position:50%
we added earlier
to start playback


192
00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:36.983 line:-1 position:50%
along all the other users
in the session.


193
00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:40.220 line:-1 position:50%
And if another user pauses
playback for whatever reason,


194
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.389 line:-1 position:50%
the Coordinator will call
your Media Session’s


195
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:44.624 line:-1 position:50%
pause action handler.


196
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,794 line:-1
That said, I’d like to point out
a few caveats.


197
00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:51.598 line:-1 position:50%
The Coordinator interface
is an experimental web API;


198
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,800 line:-1
it has yet to go
through standardization,


199
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.770 line:-1 position:50%
and while that process
will likely improve this API,


200
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.539 line:-1 position:50%
some aspects
of the API may change.


201
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.573 line:-1 position:50%
To find out more,


202
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:05,812 line:-1
please watch the W3C’s
Media Session GitHub page.


203
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,815 line:-1
This API is currently
only implemented in Safari,


204
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,917 line:-1
though the GroupActivities
framework,


205
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,052 line:-1
which Safari uses
to implement the Coordinator,


206
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:18,391 line:-1
can -- and we hope will -- be
adopted by other Mac browsers.


207
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.327 line:-1 position:50%
And the final caveat is
that while your users can join


208
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,263 line:-1
an existing session in Safari,


209
00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:26.232 line:-1 position:50%
a GroupSession currently
must be initiated


210
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:30.870 line:-1 position:50%
from an iPhone, iPad,
or macOS application.


211
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.008 line:-1 position:50%
So let’s add support
for the Coordinator now.


212
00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:37.444 line:-1 position:50%
The first thing I’d like to do
is join the session


213
00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:39.212 line:-1 position:50%
once it becomes available.


214
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,449 line:-1
So I’m going to add a
coordinatorchange event listener


215
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,951 line:-1
to mediaSession.


216
00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:47.921 line:-1 position:50%
In the handler, if there’s
a non-null coordinator property


217
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,825 line:-1
on mediaSession,
I’ll call its join() function.


218
00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:54.160 line:-1 position:50%
I’d also like to add an icon
to my controls


219
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.529 line:-1 position:50%
to show that we’re playing back
in a session.


220
00:09:56.529 --> 00:10:00.066 line:-1 position:50%
So in the handler, I’ll either
show or hide the icon,


221
00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:02.368 line:-1 position:50%
based on whether
there’s a coordinator property


222
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,471 line:-1
on mediaSession.


223
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:08.541 line:-1 position:50%
I’m also going to hook up a
click event listener to the icon


224
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:13,179 line:-1
to call leave()
on the coordinator.


225
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,348 line:0
Next, I’m going to modify
the event handlers


226
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,850 position:50%
for my custom controls


227
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,320 position:50%
to check for the presence of a
coordinator, and if we have one,


228
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,690 line:0
call the appropriate
coordinator function instead.


229
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,161 position:50%
I’ll add one for my Play button,
and then for my Pause button,


230
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,297 line:0
and also for timeline slider.


231
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,834 position:50%
And let’s see it in action!


232
00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:37.504 line:-1 position:50%
I’ve got an invite here
from my friend Sam,


233
00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:39.572 line:-1 position:50%
