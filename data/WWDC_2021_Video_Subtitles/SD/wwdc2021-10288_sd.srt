Paul Sim: Hi there! I'm Paul,


7
00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.379 line:-1 position:50%
and I work
on the SF Symbols app.


8
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,815 line:-1
Today, we're going to go through
some of the awesome new features


9
00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.884 line:-1 position:50%
we've added to the app
this year and talk about


10
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,887 line:-1
how the SF Symbols app can
help you create your own apps,


11
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,022 line:-1
whether you're a designer,
a developer,


12
00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.057 line:-1 position:50%
or a little bit of both.


13
00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.827 line:-1 position:50%
First, we'll go over how to find
symbols to use in your projects


14
00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.862 line:-1 position:50%
and preview how they'll look.


15
00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:29.963 line:-1 position:50%
Then we'll talk about


16
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,667 line:-1
how the app can help manage
custom symbols that you create.


17
00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:37.004 line:-1 position:50%
And finally, we'll show you how
you can copy and export symbols


18
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.006 line:-1 position:50%
for use throughout
all stages of the design


19
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,174 line:-1
and development process.


20
00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.176 line:-1 position:50%
Now, I've got an idea
for a card game app.


21
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,746 line:-1
I want my family to be able
to play games together,


22
00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:47.814 line:-1 position:50%
even if we can't be
in the same room.


23
00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.683 line:-1 position:50%
So let's dive
into the SF Symbols app


24
00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:54.154 line:-1 position:50%
and find some symbols
I can use in my UI.


25
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,223 line:-1
First off, I'll start
by making a collection


26
00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.125 line:-1 position:50%
using the plus button
here in the corner,


27
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,861 line:-1
so I can keep symbols
for my card game together


28
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:03.297 line:-1 position:50%
and find them quickly later on.


29
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,898 line:-1
Now, let's start
finding some symbols.


30
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,600 line:-1
It won't be much
of a family game night


31
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.268 line:-1 position:50%
if I'm the only one playing,


32
00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:11.705 line:-1 position:50%
so let's look for a symbol I can
use for inviting other players.


33
00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.907 line:-1 position:50%
You can browse the SF Symbols
catalog by category


34
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.275 line:-1 position:50%
here in the sidebar.


35
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,944 position:50%
The Human category
has some symbols


36
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,046 line:0
that could be perfect
for adding a player.


37
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:22,382 line:0
I'll drag and drop this symbol
with a person and a plus


38
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:27,187 line:0
onto my Card Game collection so
I can find it quickly later on.


39
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,623 line:0
Well, once we've invited some
players, we'll need some cards.


40
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,559 line:0
I'll need symbols for spades,
hearts, clubs, and diamonds --


41
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,428 position:50%
the four suits of cards.


42
00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:37.097 line:-1 position:50%
So I'll search for the word
"suit" up here in the toolbar,


43
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.166 line:-1 position:50%
which filters
the system-provided catalog


44
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,467 line:-1
of symbols.


45
00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.269 line:-1 position:50%
And SF Symbols
has me covered here, too.


46
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:44.638 line:-1 position:50%
I will add the filled versions
of these suits


47
00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:47.574 line:-1 position:50%
to my Card Game collection.


48
00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.609 line:-1 position:50%
Some symbols for moving cards
around in the deck


49
00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.544 line:-1 position:50%
could come in handy.


50
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,946 position:50%
Let's search
for the word "stack"


51
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:58,652 position:50%
and find a few more
symbols to use.


52
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,053 line:0
And finally, I want to make sure


53
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,621 position:50%
new players can get
their bearings


54
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,524 line:0
when facing off against some of
the card experts in my family,


55
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,393 position:50%
so we should have
a rule book, too.


56
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,862 line:-1
One more search for "book"


57
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,999 line:-1
and one more symbol
to add to my collection.


58
00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.035 line:-1 position:50%
Great, now I've got an
easy-to-get-to shortlist


59
00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:18.372 line:-1 position:50%
of all the symbols
I've found for my project.


60
00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:19.606 line:-1 position:50%
So what's next?


61
00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.075 line:-1 position:50%
Well, the SF Symbols library
is constantly growing,


62
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,644 line:-1
so it's important to make sure
I can use these symbols


63
00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:28.215 line:-1 position:50%
on all of the platforms
I want my app to run on.


64
00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:30.384 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a look
at my Add Player symbol.


65
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,918 line:-1
I know that some
of my family members


66
00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.787 line:-1 position:50%
are still running older OS's,


67
00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:37.791 line:-1 position:50%
so I want to make sure
that my app runs on iOS 13.


68
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.926 line:-1 position:50%
I can see here
in the information inspector


69
00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:43.230 line:-1 position:50%
that the name
person.fill.badge.plus


70
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,967 line:-1
has been available in monochrome
since SF Symbols version 2.0,


71
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:51,071 line:-1
which corresponds to iOS 14;
that's too new for me.


72
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,106 line:-1
However, there's another name
down here


73
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,708 line:-1
with a warning
symbol next to it.


74
00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.576 line:-1 position:50%
That is a deprecated name,


75
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,613 line:-1
which will work if I need
to target older platforms.


76
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:03,383 line:-1
person.badge.plus.fill
is available in monochrome


77
00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.453 line:-1 position:50%
going all the way back
to SF Symbols 1.0,


78
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,422 line:-1
which corresponds to iOS 13.


79
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,792 line:-1
So I can use that name if
I want to maintain compatibility


80
00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:15.662 line:-1 position:50%
with iOS 13
and other older platforms.


81
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,032 line:-1
But remember that deprecated
names are, well, deprecated.


82
00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:22.335 line:-1 position:50%
So, you should move to the newer
names as soon as you can.


83
00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:24.571 line:-1 position:50%
Once I know my family
has updated their devices


84
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,407 line:-1
and I'm ready to drop support
for older OS's,


85
00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:29.409 line:-1 position:50%
I should switch to using
the more modern name


86
00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.445 line:-1 position:50%
for this symbol.


87
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,512 line:-1
What else should I check


88
00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.748 line:-1 position:50%
before I'm ready to use
these symbols in my app?


89
00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:37.050 line:-1 position:50%
Well, lots of my family members
use languages


90
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,653 line:-1
other than American English
on their devices,


91
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,455 line:-1
and I want to make sure
that my card game app


92
00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:43.790 line:-1 position:50%
looks great for them, too.


93
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.693 line:-1 position:50%
The information inspector also
shows how a symbol's appearance


94
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,162 line:-1
will change
in different localizations.


95
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,331 line:-1
The symbol I grabbed
for my rule book earlier


96
00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:52.999 line:-1 position:50%
automatically appears
with a character


97
00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.634 line:-1 position:50%
in the user's native script.


98
00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:57.938 line:-1 position:50%
It even adjusts the direction
that the book opens


99
00:03:57.938 --> 00:03:59.039 line:-1 position:50%
to account for differences


100
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,576 line:-1
between left-to-right
and right-to-left languages.


101
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,145 line:-1
So that means,
with zero extra work from me,


102
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,481 line:-1
every member of my family
is going to see a book


103
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.883 line:-1 position:50%
with a character
from their preferred language,


104
00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:11.384 line:-1 position:50%
which is pretty awesome.


105
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,554 line:-1
Now, it is possible to specify
a particular localization


106
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:20,060 line:-1
in Xcode using suffixes
like .ar or .zh, but in general,


107
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.396 line:-1 position:50%
you'll want to use the symbol
name with no localization suffix


108
00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.866 line:-1 position:50%
and let the system choose
the proper representation


109
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,702 line:-1
for your user's
preferred language.


110
00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:30.904 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let's get an idea of what
these symbols will look like


111
00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:32.105 line:-1 position:50%
in our app.


112
00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.040 line:-1 position:50%
Using the rendering inspector,
I can control


113
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,976 line:-1
how the symbols are rendered
here in the app


114
00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:38.311 line:-1 position:50%
and see how they'll look
next to each other.


115
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,881 line:-1
Let's take a quick tour through
the different rendering modes.


116
00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:41.882 line:-1 position:50%
In Monochrome mode,


117
00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:44.885 line:-1 position:50%
I can choose a single color
to use when rendering symbols,


118
00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:47.387 line:-1 position:50%
like the built-in
system purple.


119
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:52,959 line:-1
Or I can choose a custom color.


120
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,661 line:-1
If I switch to Multicolor mode,


121
00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:57.330 line:-1 position:50%
the symbols take on colors
intrinsic to their meaning.


122
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,566 line:-1
The heart and diamond suits
turn red,


123
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,768 line:-1
and the spade
and club turn black.


124
00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:04.437 line:-1 position:50%
In fact, the spade and club
will even adjust their color


125
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,872 line:-1
to account for Dark Mode,


126
00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:09.342 line:-1 position:50%
which I can test using
the Background picker here.


127
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,212 line:-1
And I can pick a color
to use for the parts of symbols


128
00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:15.916 line:-1 position:50%
that don't have
an intrinsic color.


129
00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:18.451 line:-1 position:50%
This year, we introduced
the Hierarchical rendering mode


130
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.520 line:-1 position:50%
which takes a single color


131
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.657 line:-1 position:50%
and uses opacity to add depth
and interest to symbols.


132
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,326 line:-1
I can pick a single color
and see how different parts


133
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:30.931 line:-1 position:50%
of the symbol use different
levels of opacity to stand out.


134
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,933 line:-1
And finally, the new Palette
rendering mode


135
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,668 line:-1
provides finer-grained control.


136
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,204 line:-1
I can specify two or three
different colors to use


137
00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:42.475 line:-1 position:50%
during rendering and see how
that affects the symbols.


138
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,377 line:0
For a deeper dive into
the different rendering modes


139
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,912 position:50%
and when you might want
to use them,


140
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:49,082 position:50%
along with some insight into the
latest additions to SF Symbols,


141
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,752 position:50%
check out Thalia's session,
"What's new in SF Symbols."


142
00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:55.055 line:-1 position:50%
All right, now I've got a bunch
of SF Symbols picked out


143
00:05:55.055 --> 00:05:56.823 line:-1 position:50%
that are going to speed up
the design and development


144
00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:57.791 line:-1 position:50%
of my app --


145
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,492 line:-1
not to mention make it
look amazing.


146
00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:02.128 line:-1 position:50%
There are now
over 3000 SF Symbols


147
00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:03.663 line:-1 position:50%
built into Apple platforms.


148
00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:06.566 line:-1 position:50%
But what if we need something
for our app that isn't covered?


149
00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:09.002 line:-1 position:50%
That's where custom
symbols come in.


150
00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:11.137 line:-1 position:50%
Since the queen of hearts
plays such an important role


151
00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:12.239 line:-1 position:50%
in so many card games,


152
00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:15.308 line:-1 position:50%
I want to make sure that she has
a special symbol in my app.


153
00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:17.611 line:-1 position:50%
There isn't a symbol
in the system set for this,


154
00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:20.513 line:-1 position:50%
so it's time to make
my own custom symbol.


155
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,383 line:-1
Now, I like the built-in crown
SF Symbol,


156
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,019 line:-1
and I think that's a great place
to start for my custom design.


157
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,555 line:-1
So I'll select crown.fill,


158
00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:32.626 line:-1 position:50%
and choose File >
Duplicate as Custom Symbol.


159
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,028 line:-1
And that's it, I've just created
a custom symbol.


160
00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:36.863 line:-1 position:50%
From here, I can give it
a more descriptive name


161
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,333 line:-1
like queen.heart.fill,


162
00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:43.470 line:-1 position:50%
and start making changes
to the design.


163
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.105 line:-1 position:50%
To change the shape
of a custom symbol,


164
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,440 line:-1
I'll export a template SVG file,


165
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,876 line:-1
open it with a vector editor
like Sketch,


166
00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:53.513 line:-1 position:50%
and make my modifications
to the design.


167
00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:56.483 line:-1 position:50%
Once I'm done, I can just drag
and drop the edited template


168
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:01,321 line:-1
back onto my custom symbol
in the SF Symbols app,


169
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,124 line:-1
and my symbol
will update instantly.


170
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,925 line:-1
Now, like I said earlier,
I want to make sure


171
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,594 line:-1
our queen has a symbol
that really pops,


172
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,530 line:-1
so I want my new custom symbol
to use the new rendering modes


173
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.999 line:-1 position:50%
that were introduced this year.


174
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,269 line:-1
When I switch to a rendering
mode like Multicolor,


175
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.138 line:-1 position:50%
in the sidebar
with my custom symbol selected,


176
00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:20.407 line:-1 position:50%
I can see a new set
of controls that allow me


177
00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:23.977 line:-1 position:50%
to annotate my symbol and opt
into the new rendering modes.


178
00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:25.945 line:-1 position:50%
I can also use
the new Gallery view


179
00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:30.050 line:-1 position:50%
to get a big representation
of my symbol to edit.


180
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,719 line:-1
For Multicolor mode, let's make
the heart part of the crown red


181
00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:35.221 line:-1 position:50%
and the lower part
of the crown yellow.


182
00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:38.792 line:-1 position:50%
I'll select the heart
and drag it to a new layer.


183
00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.995 line:-1 position:50%
Then I can set
the new layer's color to red


184
00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:43.330 line:-1 position:50%
and set the older layer


185
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,068 line:-1
with the lower parts
of the crown's color to yellow.


186
00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:49.369 line:-1 position:50%
In Hierarchical mode,


187
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,838 line:-1
we'll put the heart
on a primary layer


188
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,507 line:-1
and the rest of the crown
on a secondary layer.


189
00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:56.876 line:-1 position:50%
Well, the default layer
is already set to Primary,


190
00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:59.479 line:-1 position:50%
so let's grab the two lower
parts of the crown


191
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.382 line:-1 position:50%
and drag them to a new layer.


192
00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:04.551 line:-1 position:50%
Since I've already
got a primary layer,


193
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,587 line:-1
the new layer that's created is
automatically set to Secondary,


194
00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:09.556 line:-1 position:50%
so I'm done.


195
00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:10.890 line:-1 position:50%
OK, now that I'm done
annotating,


196
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.126 line:-1 position:50%
let's add my symbol
to my Card Game collection


197
00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:15.628 line:-1 position:50%
to keep it with all
my other symbols.


198
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,796 line:-1
Once it's part of my collection,


199
00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:19.299 line:-1 position:50%
I can see how it looks alongside
other system symbols


200
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:24,170 line:-1
using all the new
rendering modes.


201
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,271 line:0
If you'd like to do a deep dive


202
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,173 line:0
into how to make
your own custom symbol


203
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,942 position:50%
and learn about some
of the awesome new things


204
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,544 line:0
that were added to custom
symbol templates this year,


205
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,612 position:50%
you can find all of that


206
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:36,282 line:0
in the "Create Custom
Symbols" session with Mike.


207
00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:37.550 line:-1 position:50%
All right, I've got
my collection of symbols


208
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,518 line:-1
ready to go.


209
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:43,223 line:-1
Now it's time to get them into
my designs and into my code.


210
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,358 line:-1
Let's start with a simple case
for a design comp.


211
00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:48.027 line:-1 position:50%
Remember the book symbol
I grabbed for my rule book?


212
00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:51.197 line:-1 position:50%
I want to mock up a button with
that symbol and the word "Rules"


213
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,500 line:-1
so users know they can tap
for more information


214
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.468 line:-1 position:50%
on how to play the game.


215
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,872 line:-1
So I'm using
a system-provided SF Symbol,


216
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,608 line:-1
I'm placing it alongside text,


217
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,577 line:-1
and I'm planning on using
the Monochrome rendering mode.


218
00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:07.347 line:-1 position:50%
In this case, the absolute
best way to get this symbol


219
00:09:07.347 --> 00:09:09.816 line:-1 position:50%
into a design app
is to use the SF fonts


220
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:13,987 line:-1
that were installed
alongside the SF Symbols app.


221
00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:17.490 line:-1 position:50%
To do this, I'll choose
Edit > Copy Symbol --


222
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,994 line:-1
or press Command-C --
and paste into my design app.


223
00:09:20.994 --> 00:09:22.929 line:-1 position:50%
This will paste
the symbol as text.


224
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,831 line:-1
I can add the word
"Rules" to it --


225
00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:28.368 line:-1 position:50%
right alongside it --
in the same text box.


226
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,703 line:-1
Using the SF fonts means
that the pasted symbol


227
00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.305 line:-1 position:50%
will be aligned
and weight-matched


228
00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:33.473 line:-1 position:50%
with text around it,


229
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,642 line:-1
with no additional work
required from me.


230
00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:37.277 line:-1 position:50%
And the kind of design
that requires


231
00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:40.280 line:-1 position:50%
no additional work from me
is my favorite kind of design.


232
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,315 line:0
For more information
on using the SF fonts,


233
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,519 position:50%
check out the "SF Symbols 2"
session from WWDC20.


234
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,222 line:-1
So that's the story for system
symbols in monochrome.


235
00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:51.758 line:-1 position:50%
But what about our special
queen of hearts symbol?


236
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,059 line:-1
Since it's a custom symbol,


237
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,461 line:-1
rather than a built-in
system symbol,


238
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,563 line:-1
we can't use the SF fonts.


239
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,232 line:-1
And what about system symbols
using rendering modes


240
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,502 line:-1
like Multicolor or Hierarchical?


241
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:05,872 line:-1
Well, I'm super excited to
announce that the SF Symbols app


242
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,541 line:-1
now supports copying
images of symbols


243
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,577 line:-1
to place in your design comps.


244
00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:14.614 line:-1 position:50%
Just select a symbol, pick the
correct weight in the toolbar,


245
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,649 line:-1
and set up
the rendering inspector.


246
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,152 line:-1
Then, choose
Edit > Copy Image --


247
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,621 line:-1
or press Option-Command-C --


248
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:27,026 line:-1
and paste into your design.


249
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,696 line:-1
You can also choose
Edit > Copy Image As...


250
00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:31.731 line:-1 position:50%
to control the format
of the copied image.


251
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,968 line:-1
Symbols can be copied
in either PNG or SVG format,


252
00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:38.137 line:-1 position:50%
and you can specify
a point size and pixel scale.


253
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,373 line:-1
The SF Symbols app will
keep using these settings


254
00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:44.010 line:-1 position:50%
for copying images until you
come back and reconfigure them.


255
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,979 line:-1
Note that copied images
of symbols


256
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,148 line:-1
may have some extra vertical
padding added to them.


257
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,783 line:-1
This is done
so that the vertical center


258
00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:53.353 line:-1 position:50%
of the symbol images will align,
so it's easy to work


259
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,989 line:-1
with several symbols
in a horizontal row.


260
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,224 line:-1
Now, unlike using the SF fonts,


261
00:10:58.224 --> 00:11:00.426 line:-1 position:50%
these images aren't guaranteed
to be weight-matched


262
00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.462 line:-1 position:50%
or automatically aligned
with text near them,


263
00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:04.664 line:-1 position:50%
but we're really excited
about the flexibility


264
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:08.434 line:-1 position:50%
that this new feature brings
to designing with symbols.


265
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,837 line:0
Remember that Copy Image
is intended to be used


266
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,805 line:0
when you're making design comps.


267
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,474 line:0
It's the best way to get
your custom symbols


268
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,076 line:0
into your designs,
and it will be a big help


269
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,379 position:50%
when you're designing with
symbols that use rendering modes


270
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,149 position:50%
like Multicolor, Hierarchical,
or Palette.


271
00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:25.618 line:-1 position:50%
I won't go into much detail
about using SF Symbols


272
00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:29.589 line:-1 position:50%
in code here, but I want to
mention a common sticking point.


273
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,691 line:-1
When copying an SF Symbol
for use in code,


274
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.561 line:-1 position:50%
make sure you're copying
the name of the symbol,


275
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:36.596 line:-1 position:50%
rather than the symbol itself.


276
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,298 line:-1
And though it may be tempting


277
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,833 line:-1
to use the new Copy Image
feature to bring a symbol


278
00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:42.535 line:-1 position:50%
into an asset catalog,


279
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,238 line:-1
you should instead
use the Export Symbol option


280
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,606 line:-1
to make sure you get
all the features


281
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,375 line:-1
that a full custom symbol
provides.


282
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,911 line:0
For more information
on using SF Symbols in code,


283
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,279 line:0
check out
Tom and Jacob's sessions


284
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,318 position:50%
on using SF Symbols in SwiftUI,
UIKit, and AppKit.


285
00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:00.386 line:-1 position:50%
So the SF Symbols app
is here to help you


286
00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.856 line:-1 position:50%
throughout your entire design
and development process.


287
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,758 line:-1
You can keep the symbols
you're using close at hand


288
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,494 line:-1
with collections and preview
what the symbols will look like


289
00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:11.497 line:-1 position:50%
in your app
using different rendering modes.


290
00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:13.232 line:-1 position:50%
You can create
your own custom symbols


291
00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:15.568 line:-1 position:50%
and adopt the new rendering
modes to give your app


292
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,236 line:-1
its own special personality,


293
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:21,174 line:-1
while making sure it looks right
at home on Apple platforms.


294
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,943 line:0
And of course, you can copy
or export symbols


295
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,179 position:50%
to use in your design comps
and Xcode projects


296
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,282 position:50%
to make an app that looks
and feels great.


297
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,584 line:-1
And that's what's new in
the SF Symbols app this year.


298
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,087 line:-1
We hope that it will help you
design and develop accessible,


299
00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.990 line:-1 position:50%
inclusive, and great-looking
apps in record time.


300
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,658 line:-1
And hey, once you're done
doing that,


301
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:41,127 line:-1
you're always welcome to join
my family for a game of cards.
