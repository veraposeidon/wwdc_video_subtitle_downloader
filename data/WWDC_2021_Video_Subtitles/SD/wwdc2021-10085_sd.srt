[Lauren] Hi, everyone.


4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,646 line:-2
I'm Lauren
from Privacy Engineering,


5
00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.916 line:-2 align:center
and welcome to "Apple's privacy
pillars in focus."


6
00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.484 line:-1 align:center
At Apple,


7
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:21,154 line:-2
we believe that privacy
is a fundamental human right.


8
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:24,324 line:-2
Our devices are an important
part of entertaining us


9
00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.159 line:-2 align:center
and connecting us
to one another,


10
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,529 line:-2
especially when we have
had to stay connected


11
00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.197 line:-1 align:center
from a distance.


12
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,666 line:-2
And what people share
from within these experiences


13
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.501 line:-1 align:center
should be up to them.


14
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.604 line:-2 align:center
When people understand what
happens with their data


15
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,506 line:-1
and are in control,


16
00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:42.142 line:-2 align:center
they are more likely
to engage with your experiences


17
00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:46.113 line:-2 align:center
and let your app become
a trusted part of their life.


18
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,949 line:-2
So, we have to work
together to make sure


19
00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.187 line:-2 align:center
that great features and great
privacy aren't a tradeoff.


20
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:57,424 line:-2
This isn't always easy,
so in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey,


21
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,093 line:-2
we are continuing
to provide innovative tools


22
00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.296 line:-2 align:center
that make it easier
for you to protect people


23
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:05,399 line:-2
while building features
that they will love.


24
00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.668 line:-2 align:center
In this video,
we will walk you through


25
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:11,338 line:-2
Apple's approach to privacy
and introduce new technologies


26
00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:13.106 line:-2 align:center
that make
building new features


27
00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:16.577 line:-2 align:center
while respecting people's
choices as simple as ever.


28
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,014 line:-2
Improving the privacy
protections of your app


29
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,150 line:-1
can seem like a lofty goal,


30
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.419 line:-2 align:center
or you may not even know
where to start,


31
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,721 line:-2
so we've simplified
engineering privacy


32
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,757 line:-2
into a series of principles
and related questions


33
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,061 line:-2
that you can ask yourself that
guide how to design products.


34
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,799 line:-2
So, what's
our approach to privacy?


35
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,269 align:center
At Apple, we have four
fundamental privacy pillars.


36
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,771 line:0
The first is data minimization,


37
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,773 align:center
which requesting and only using


38
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,576 align:center
data that you actually need.


39
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,945 align:center
The second is on-device
processing,


40
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,181 align:center
which is processing data
locally


41
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,050 align:center
without sending it to a server.


42
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,987 align:center
The third is transparency
and control,


43
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,755 line:0
which is providing people


44
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,423 align:center
with a clear understanding


45
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,658 align:center
and control over


46
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,094 align:center
how their data is used.


47
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,029 line:0
And finally, security
protections


48
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,864 align:center
help enforce the privacy
protections


49
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,933 line:0
on our platform.


50
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,969 align:center
In practice, these guidelines
translate to a series


51
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,273 align:center
of questions that you can ask
yourself about your features.


52
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,609 align:center
For data minimization,
do I need this data


53
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,345 line:0
in order
to make my feature great?


54
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,114 align:center
For on-device processing,


55
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,350 align:center
why does the server
need visibility into this data?


56
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,619 line:0
For transparency and control,


57
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,755 align:center
what are we gonna use this
data for,


58
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,524 line:0
and how do we communicate
that to people?


59
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,927 align:center
And Finally,
for security protections,


60
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:43,463 align:center
how is this data protected
in transit and at rest?


61
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,233 line:-2
Garrett and I will walk you
through the new features


62
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,101 line:-2
that you can adopt
to only collect


63
00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:50.971 line:-2 align:center
the data that you need,
protect your user's data,


64
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:53.440 line:-2 align:center
and a few technologies
that may inspire you


65
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.910 line:-2 align:center
to think about new opportunities
for privacy in your app.


66
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.680 line:-2 align:center
And then, Elliot will dive
into how Private Relay works


67
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.483 line:-2 align:center
and how we applied the pillars
to shape its design.


68
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,855 line:-2
Let's start with data
minimization in iOS 15.


69
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:12,726 line:-2
The places that people go can
reveal a lot about their lives.


70
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,495 line:-2
Your app
may have great experiences


71
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,698 line:-1
that rely on location.


72
00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:19.800 line:-2 align:center
But people may be skeptical
of granting your app


73
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.502 line:-1 align:center
location access right away.


74
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,507 line:-2
In iOS 13, we provided
a new way for people


75
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,909 line:-2
to try out location
features in your app


76
00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.578 line:-1 align:center
by selecting Allow Once.


77
00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:35.215 line:-2 align:center
But this experience can result
in repetitive prompts.


78
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,720 line:-2
In iOS 15, there is a new way
to build location-based features


79
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.956 line:-2 align:center
that more seamlessly blend in
with your app's experience,


80
00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.792 line:-2 align:center
while allowing people to choose
when they share location.


81
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,796 align:center
You can now add
a Share Current Location button


82
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,466 line:0
right into your
app's experience.


83
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,335 align:center
When people tap on it,
your app will receive


84
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,871 align:center
access to their location
for that session,


85
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,140 line:0
just like Allow Once.


86
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,211 line:0
For many apps, only a few
features may rely on location.


87
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,447 align:center
Adopting the location button
is a great way for you


88
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,250 line:0
to build trust with people
accessing location when they


89
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,287 line:0
interact with the features
that actually need it.


90
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.823 line:-2 align:center
When people tap this button
for the first time,


91
00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:19.126 line:-2 align:center
they'll learn how it works
and select whether


92
00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:22.629 line:-2 align:center
the app will have precise
or approximate location.


93
00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:25.933 line:-2 align:center
The location arrow
on the top left


94
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,668 line:-2
will then appear
to signal to people


95
00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:30.204 line:-2 align:center
that your app
has received their location.


96
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:34,141 line:-2
Next time they tap a location
button in your app,


97
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:37,878 line:-2
it will just work,
without any prompts.


98
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,013 line:-2
The location permission
is session-based


99
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,850 line:-2
and will last until
they leave the app.


100
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.319 line:-2 align:center
This works just like
allow-once access


101
00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.020 line:-1 align:center
but is so seamless


102
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.823 line:-2 align:center
that it's a great
replacement for while-in-use!


103
00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:53.160 line:-2 align:center
Compared to while-in-use,
location buttons let you


104
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.295 line:-2 align:center
offer a lower-commitment
way for people


105
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,165 line:-2
to try out your
location-based features.


106
00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:00.400 line:-1 align:center
The button can be customized


107
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,768 line:-1
to fit in with the rest of


108
00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:03.303 line:-1 align:center
your app by setting properties


109
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.539 line:-1 align:center
on the CLLocationButton.


110
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,974 line:-1
Some aspects of the button


111
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,342 line:-1
that you can customize


112
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,143 line:-1
include background color,


113
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,012 line:-1
text and location arrow color,


114
00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:14.615 line:-1 align:center
and rounded corners.


115
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,951 line:-2
These location buttons are built
to ensure that people intend


116
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:22.222 line:-2 align:center
to provide location to the app
when the button is pressed.


117
00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:24.758 line:-2 align:center
The consistent string
and iconography enables them


118
00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:28.729 line:-2 align:center
to be easily recognizable,
and limitations on contrast,


119
00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.866 line:-2 align:center
size, and shape ensures
that they are visible.


120
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,035 line:-2
This means that iOS can
confirm that the button


121
00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:37.604 line:-1 align:center
was tapped directly.


122
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,541 line:-2
Location buttons
are supported on watchOS,


123
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:45.412 line:-2 align:center
iOS, iPadOS,
and macOS with Catalyst.


124
00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:48.515 line:-2 align:center
Often, people have to make
a big choice about


125
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.585 line:-2 align:center
location access
right when they open your app.


126
00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:54.454 line:-2 align:center
The location button gives people
more precise control


127
00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.823 line:-2 align:center
over when their location
is used,


128
00:05:56.823 --> 00:06:00.027 line:-2 align:center
while ensuring a more
seamless user experience.


129
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:04,131 line:-2
Using the same technology as
the location button,


130
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,966 line:-1
secure paste confirms


131
00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:08.535 line:-2 align:center
that the paste button
was tapped directly.


132
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,271 line:-2
Now, the OS can reliably
distinguish


133
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,107 line:-2
user-triggered pastes
from programmatic pastes


134
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,276 line:-1
that are initiated by the app.


135
00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:21.548 line:-2 align:center
In iOS 14,
the paste-transparency notice


136
00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:24.918 line:-2 align:center
let people know when apps
access the pasteboard.


137
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,755 line:-2
This also helped you learn when
an SDK included in your app


138
00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:31.358 line:-2 align:center
may have accessed
the pasteboard unexpectedly.


139
00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:35.429 line:-2 align:center
The transparency notice
is no longer needed


140
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,865 line:-2
when people paste through
the edit options.


141
00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:41.068 line:-2 align:center
The notice will only be shown
in the UI if the user


142
00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:44.004 line:-2 align:center
did not initiate the paste
themselves in the edit menu


143
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,139 line:-1
or through their keyboard.


144
00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.941 line:-1 align:center
To improve your experience,


145
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:51,278 line:-2
shift towards only
user-initiated pastes.


146
00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:53.480 line:-2 align:center
If you need
to access the pasteboard,


147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,682 line:-2
you can use the data
detectors to confirm


148
00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:57.818 line:-2 align:center
that the content
in the pasteboard is


149
00:06:57.818 --> 00:07:01.355 line:-2 align:center
relevant to your application
before you access it.


150
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:05,058 line:-2
The next pillar
is on-device processing.


151
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,628 line:-2
On-device processing is
a fundamental building block


152
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:11,732 line:-2
to core features, like Face ID,
quick-type suggestions,


153
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:14,434 line:-2
and measuring
blood-oxygen level.


154
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:17.404 line:-2 align:center
The main benefit of on-device
processing is that you can


155
00:07:17.404 --> 00:07:20.407 line:-2 align:center
build amazing features
using sensitive data,


156
00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:22.776 line:-2 align:center
without sending it
to your server.


157
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:28,782 line:-2
In iOS 15, we applied this
principle to Siri in a big way.


158
00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:32.586 line:-2 align:center
Siri is a great example of how
we deliver powerful features


159
00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:35.355 line:-2 align:center
with industry-leading
privacy built in.


160
00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:39.359 line:-2 align:center
From the beginning,
Siri has always been designed


161
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,562 line:-1
to protect your privacy.


162
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:44,565 line:-2
Audio recordings
are not stored by default.


163
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,467 line:-2
Your requests are associated
with a random identifier,


164
00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.503 line:-1 align:center
not your Apple ID.


165
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,438 line:-2
And we work to keep
your personal information


166
00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:53.707 line:-1 align:center
on your device.


167
00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:56.910 line:-2 align:center
However, running large
machine-learning models,


168
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.046 line:-1 align:center
like those used by Siri,


169
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:02,249 line:-2
typically requires racks of
servers.


170
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,185 line:-2
But around the time we released
iOS 12,


171
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,221 line:-2
we also added
the Apple Neural Engine


172
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:08.956 line:-1 align:center
to our hardware.


173
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,291 line:-2
The Apple Neural Engine
has enabled us to move


174
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:13.594 line:-2 align:center
more components of Siri
on-device.


175
00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:17.631 line:-2 align:center
In iOS 13,
we introduced the ability


176
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:21,268 line:-2
to generate the Siri Voice
entirely on-device.


177
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:24,037 line:-2
This means that it became
possible for Siri's response


178
00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:26.907 line:-2 align:center
to your request
to not leave your device.


179
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:33,347 line:-2
In iOS 14, we introduced
on-device keyboard dictation.


180
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,649 line:-2
This was the first high-quality
speech-to-text model


181
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,985 line:-1
that we ran on-device.


182
00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:40.320 line:-2 align:center
One concern that people
still have


183
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.624 line:-2 align:center
with voice assistants is
unwanted voice recording.


184
00:08:43.624 --> 00:08:45.692 line:-1 align:center
To help address this concern,


185
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,795 line:-2
we are moving all automatic
speech recognition models


186
00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:52.866 line:-2 align:center
for Siri
to run entirely on-device.


187
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,936 line:-2
By bringing on-device
speech recognition to Siri,


188
00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:59.907 line:-2 align:center
this means that, by default,
the audio of your requests


189
00:08:59.907 --> 00:09:03.043 line:-2 align:center
will not leave
your iPhone or iPad.


190
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,279 line:-2
This new innovation
is another step


191
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,882 line:-2
in the right direction
for on-device processing.


192
00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.318 line:-2 align:center
Moving Siri automatic
speech recognition models


193
00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:14.655 line:-2 align:center
on-device is a great example
of how designing for privacy


194
00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:17.090 line:-1 align:center
enables great new features.


195
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:22.229 line:-2 align:center
On-device processing means
that Siri is incredibly fast.


196
00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:25.632 line:-2 align:center
By no longer sending requests
to the server and processing


197
00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:30.337 line:-2 align:center
on-device, instead, Siri can
respond to your requests faster.


198
00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:33.707 line:-2 align:center
And now, you can even make
some requests while offline.


199
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,211 align:center
The Apple Neural Engine
has been a key part


200
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:40,280 line:0
of moving more Siri
processing on-device.


201
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,816 line:0
In iOS 15,
you can take advantage


202
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,985 line:0
of the Apple Neural Engine, too.


203
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:48,622 line:-2
New in iOS 15,
you can use the CreateML


204
00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:52.860 line:-2 align:center
framework to train models
right on an iPhone or iPad.


205
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.395 line:-2 align:center
Now, you can personalize
models to each person


206
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,830 line:-1
who uses your app,


207
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,832 align:center
leaving sensitive data,
like photos,


208
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,068 align:center
all on their device.


209
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,003 line:0
Check out the Machine Learning
team's talk,


210
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,906 align:center
"Build dynamic iOS apps with
the Create ML framework,"


211
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,474 align:center
to learn more.


212
00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:10.077 line:-2 align:center
Next, Garrett will tell you
about transparency


213
00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:14.147 line:-2 align:center
and control on iOS 15
and macOS Monterey.


214
00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:16.216 line:-1 align:center
[Garrett] Thanks, Lauren!


215
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,652 line:-2
Building clear transparency
and understandable controls


216
00:10:18.652 --> 00:10:21.455 line:-2 align:center
into your app can help you
build trust with people.


217
00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:23.757 line:-2 align:center
Knowing how you plan
to use their email,


218
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,827 line:-2
photos, or health data,
or who you plan to share it with


219
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,363 line:-2
gives people the comfort
to explore your app's features


220
00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:31.431 line:-1 align:center
and use your app more fully.


221
00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:34.101 line:-2 align:center
So, today, we're going
to talk through a number


222
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:37,471 line:-2
of examples of transparency
and control on our platforms,


223
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:40.674 line:-2 align:center
making sure you know
what steps to take for your app.


224
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,077 line:-1
First, we'll talk about


225
00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:46.580 line:-2 align:center
email-related transparency
and control features.


226
00:10:48.348 --> 00:10:50.050 line:-2 align:center
You may have thought
twice before providing


227
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.286 line:-2 align:center
your email address
to a service before.


228
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:55,322 line:-2
People who use your app can have
the same apprehension.


229
00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:56.990 line:-2 align:center
They may be worried
that their information will


230
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,092 line:-2
be shared with others
or used to link their purchases


231
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,862 line:-2
or behavior
across apps and websites.


232
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,731 line:-2
In iOS 13,
Sign in With Apple introduced


233
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:07.167 line:-2 align:center
a new way to sign in
to apps and websites,


234
00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:10.304 line:-2 align:center
allowing people to hide their
names or email addresses.


235
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,541 line:-2
In iOS 15, these benefits
are available everywhere,


236
00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:17.878 line:-2 align:center
using Hide My Email
with iCloud+.


237
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,147 line:-2
From Safari,
where people can easily


238
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,783 line:-2
generate a new email address
when filling in a form,


239
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:26,186 line:-2
to right in Mail,
while composing a new message.


240
00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:30.257 line:-2 align:center
And these can come in
from other channels.


241
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,292 line:-2
Anywhere you receive
email addresses


242
00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:35.362 line:-2 align:center
might have a Hide My Email
address.


243
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,831 line:-2
When one of your customers
uses Hide My Email,


244
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:40.701 line:-2 align:center
your email will land
right in their inbox.


245
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,270 line:-2
Make sure to respect their
decision and only request


246
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.606 line:-2 align:center
additional information,
like their name,


247
00:11:45.606 --> 00:11:48.509 line:-1 align:center
if needed for your experience.


248
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,211 line:-2
In order to make email
rich and engaging,


249
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,414 line:-2
emails often contain
remotely-hosted images.


250
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,317 line:-2
When a mail program displays
one of those emails,


251
00:11:57.317 --> 00:12:00.854 line:-2 align:center
remote images are fetched,
revealing when, roughly where,


252
00:12:00.854 --> 00:12:04.691 line:-2 align:center
and on what kind of device
the mail was opened.


253
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,995 line:-2
Many marketing emails now
include unique image URLs


254
00:12:07.995 --> 00:12:10.631 line:-2 align:center
for each user,
or even invisible pixels,


255
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:13.567 line:-2 align:center
specifically to link
this information to people


256
00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:15.769 line:-1 align:center
when they read their messages.


257
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:18.605 line:-2 align:center
This resulted in people choosing
between text-only emails


258
00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:21.175 line:-2 align:center
to preserve privacy,
or rendering emails


259
00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:24.411 line:-2 align:center
with full content,
but revealing mail activity.


260
00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:29.049 line:-2 align:center
In iOS 15, we're introducing
Mail Privacy Protection.


261
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,885 line:-2
People can choose to have
iOS privately load


262
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:35,889 line:-2
remote message content,
hiding their mail activity.


263
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,926 line:-1
This is really cool!


264
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,395 line:-1
And it's great news for you.


265
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,497 line:-2
More people
will read your emails,


266
00:12:43.497 --> 00:12:47.267 line:-2 align:center
with all the images
and visuals you included.


267
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,670 line:-2
If you've been using remote
images to measure the impact


268
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.273 line:-2 align:center
of your campaigns, there are
a few changes to be aware of.


269
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,143 line:-2
Since Mail content may be loaded
automatically after delivery,


270
00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:59.213 line:-2 align:center
the time of Mail viewing
will no longer be correct.


271
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,415 line:-2
And since that content is loaded
without revealing people's


272
00:13:01.415 --> 00:13:04.184 line:-2 align:center
IP addresses and without
detailed headers,


273
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,486 line:-2
the location and type of device
reading the Mail


274
00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:08.555 line:-1 align:center
aren't revealed.


275
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,924 line:-2
And you'll see your
emails as being opened,


276
00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:14.228 line:-2 align:center
regardless of if the user
read it or not.


277
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:16.730 line:-2 align:center
Next up in transparency
and control,


278
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,299 line:-2
we'll take a quick tour through
focus and indicators.


279
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,805 line:-2
New in iOS 15,
if you have a communication app,


280
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,374 line:-2
you can assist people
in Do Not Disturb


281
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,142 line:-1
or another Focus


282
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,778 line:-2
by requesting access
to read their availability,


283
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,282 line:-2
then sharing that status
within your app's experience.


284
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,718 align:center
To request access to status,


285
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:40,721 line:0
you'll need
a NSFocusStatusUsageDescription


286
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:43,123 line:0
key in your app's Info.plist,


287
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,458 align:center
and the User Notifications


288
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,895 line:0
Communication capability
enabled in Xcode.


289
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:50,964 align:center
For more information on Focus,
check out


290
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:55,068 line:0
"Send communication and Time
Sensitive notifications."


291
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,672 line:-2
In macOS Monterey,
we've complemented the camera


292
00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:01.508 line:-2 align:center
indicator light
with a recording indicator.


293
00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:03.844 line:-2 align:center
Now, any time
the built in microphone,


294
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,780 line:-2
or W1 or H1 audio device,
is listening,


295
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.784 line:-2 align:center
people can see that with an
orange dot in the status bar.


296
00:14:10.784 --> 00:14:14.087 line:-2 align:center
Of course, part of building
trust is not abusing it.


297
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,456 line:-2
Make sure your app runs
the microphone


298
00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:19.026 line:-2 align:center
only when it makes sense
to people.


299
00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:22.162 line:-2 align:center
As an example,
if your app has a mute button,


300
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:25,032 line:-2
stop receiving audio from
the system when muted.


301
00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:28.468 line:-2 align:center
Make sure to test your app
on macOS Monterey


302
00:14:28.468 --> 00:14:31.672 line:-2 align:center
to make sure it behaves
the way people will expect.


303
00:14:31.672 --> 00:14:34.074 line:-1 align:center
Also, you can easily confirm


304
00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:36.076 line:-2 align:center
that no third-party
SDKs in your app


305
00:14:36.076 --> 00:14:38.445 line:-1 align:center
are listening unexpectedly.


306
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,081 line:-2
Next, let's look at
tools that provide


307
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,417 line:-2
transparency
for recent app behavior.


308
00:14:44.618 --> 00:14:47.354 line:-2 align:center
App Privacy Report will enable
people to understand


309
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,656 line:-2
what's going on with their
everyday applications


310
00:14:49.656 --> 00:14:53.794 line:-2 align:center
and will be available
in an upcoming software update.


311
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:56,964 line:-2
It will reveal to people
when your app accesses user data


312
00:14:56.964 --> 00:15:01.034 line:-2 align:center
and sensors, such as Location,
Photos, or Contacts


313
00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:03.504 line:-2 align:center
and show who your app
may be sharing data with


314
00:15:03.504 --> 00:15:05.839 line:-2 align:center
by listing all the domains
your app contacts,


315
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,242 line:-2
as well as the domains
that websites accessed


316
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,710 line:-1
within your app contact.


317
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,814 line:-2
App Privacy Report
will be in Privacy Settings


318
00:15:13.814 --> 00:15:16.517 line:-2 align:center
and can be enabled
by people to better understand


319
00:15:16.517 --> 00:15:18.652 line:-1 align:center
the apps they have installed.


320
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,554 line:-2
If people want to clear usage
history,


321
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:23,557 line:-2
they can
just turn it back off again.


322
00:15:23.557 --> 00:15:26.293 line:-2 align:center
It's also important to note
that App Privacy Report


323
00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:29.429 line:-2 align:center
will not record ephemeral WebKit
sessions by web browsers,


324
00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.832 line:-2 align:center
such as Private Browsing Mode
in Safari.


325
00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:38.172 line:-2 align:center
In iOS 15, Record App Activity
provides export functionality


326
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:41,408 line:-2
for you to better understand
your apps' behaviors.


327
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,877 line:-2
So, you'll
want to grab the iOS 15 beta


328
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,680 line:-2
and turn on Record App Activity
to get a head start


329
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.682 line:-2 align:center
on what people
will see for your app


330
00:15:48.682 --> 00:15:51.952 line:-2 align:center
in the App Privacy Report
feature.


331
00:15:51.952 --> 00:15:54.555 line:-2 align:center
Then, when you select
Save App Activity,


332
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:57,758 line:-1
iOS will produce a JSON file.


333
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:59,860 line:-2
You should review
the content of this JSON file


334
00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.663 line:-2 align:center
to confirm your app
behaves as expected.


335
00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:09.203 line:-1 align:center
So, let's take a look.


336
00:16:09.203 --> 00:16:11.371 line:-2 align:center
The JSON will have a list
of stream dictionaries,


337
00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:14.741 line:-2 align:center
one for each time a binary
accessed user data and sensors,


338
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:17,511 line:-1
like location or camera.


339
00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:20.214 line:-2 align:center
Here's an example
of a single access.


340
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:23,650 line:-2
First, search for all
instances of the bundle IDs


341
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,353 line:-1
of all your app's binaries.


342
00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:29.122 line:-2 align:center
From there,
the timestamps can help you


343
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,625 line:-2
tie those accesses
to your software behavior.


344
00:16:34.862 --> 00:16:36.997 line:-2 align:center
To see all the domains
you've contacted,


345
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,900 line:-2
look below
the section marker in JSON:


346
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,935 line:-1
there's a final dictionary.


347
00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:46.006 line:-2 align:center
This uses bundle IDs for keys,
so there's one dictionary


348
00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:49.042 line:-2 align:center
for each
of your app's executables.


349
00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:52.312 line:-2 align:center
From there,
you can see all domain contacts,


350
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:56,383 line:-2
when they were initiated, and if
they were app or user-initiated.


351
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,954 line:-2
Now, let me show you
the difference between


352
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:04,157 line:-2
a connection by an app
and a connection by a website.


353
00:17:04.157 --> 00:17:06.059 line:-2 align:center
Connections made by
SafariViewController


354
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,928 line:-1
and ASWebAuthenticationSessions


355
00:17:07.928 --> 00:17:11.131 line:-2 align:center
are automatically tagged as
connections by websites.


356
00:17:11.131 --> 00:17:13.133 line:-2 align:center
You can also manually tag
connections


357
00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:15.002 line:-1 align:center
as being caused by a website


358
00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:17.938 line:-2 align:center
if a connection is made
on behalf of third-party content


359
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:19,940 line:-2
and isn't core
to app functionality.


360
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:25,412 line:0
At standard layers,
we've added an attribution


361
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,948 align:center
enum to manually tag
a connection.


362
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:29,850 align:center
You'll need to specify "user."


363
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,418 align:center
If you don't specify,


364
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:34,188 align:center
connections will be
marked as app traffic.


365
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:37,257 align:center
This enum exists in
NSMutableURLRequests,


366
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,194 align:center
where you'll want to supply
the MainDocumentURL,


367
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,896 line:0
in NWConnection in the Network
framework,


368
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,098 line:0
and sockets.


369
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,967 line:0
You can also tag connections


370
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:49,903 align:center
via convenience methods in other
Apple frameworks,


371
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,907 line:0
such as LinkPresentation
and AVFoundation.


372
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:58,245 line:0
WKWebView has added new methods
to pass an NSURLRequest,


373
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,881 align:center
so you can tag your
connections appropriately.


374
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:05,485 align:center
For more info, see "Explore
WKWebView additions."


375
00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:09.489 line:-1 align:center
App Privacy Report exists


376
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:12,759 line:-2
to provide transparency
on app behaviors.


377
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,762 line:-2
And Record App Activity
is a great tool to help you


378
00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:18.565 line:-2 align:center
understand what people
will see when App Privacy Report


379
00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:21.935 line:-2 align:center
becomes available
in an upcoming software update.


380
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,538 line:-2
Your app should access
only data the user would expect


381
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,874 line:-2
and at the times
they would expect.


382
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:28,075 line:-1
This is another opportunity


383
00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:30.744 line:-2 align:center
to really build trust
with your users,


384
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:34,414 line:-2
as they can understand more of
what your application does.


385
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,217 line:-2
Also, Record App Activity
is a good way


386
00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:39.653 line:-2 align:center
to better understand
the behavior of the SDKs


387
00:18:39.653 --> 00:18:41.388 line:-1 align:center
you've put in your apps


388
00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:44.424 line:-2 align:center
and confirm their practices
align with yours.


389
00:18:44.424 --> 00:18:47.661 line:-2 align:center
Integrate Record App Activity
into your QA passes,


390
00:18:47.661 --> 00:18:50.831 line:-2 align:center
and confirm that only
the data you expect to access


391
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:53,567 line:-2
is present
in the App Activity JSON.


392
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:58,038 line:0
And for our final section
of transparency and control,


393
00:18:58,038 --> 00:18:59,840 align:center
I'd like to walk through
a few existing areas


394
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,142 line:0
where we frequently see
questions from developers.


395
00:19:03.544 --> 00:19:05.612 line:-1 align:center
In late 2020,


396
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,881 line:-2
Privacy Nutrition Labels
went live.


397
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,816 line:-2
Labels are designed
to bring transparency


398
00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:12.052 line:-1 align:center
in a glanceable format.


399
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:14,388 line:-2
Knowing what your app
will do with their data makes it


400
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:18,592 line:-2
easier for people to trust you
and engage with your app.


401
00:19:18.592 --> 00:19:21.161 line:-2 align:center
We know how hard building
good privacy is


402
00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:24.431 line:-2 align:center
and that the best work
can be invisible.


403
00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:27.868 line:-2 align:center
Your label is a place you can
show off the hard work you do


404
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,336 line:-1
to protect people.


405
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:33,807 line:-2
Labels need to be inclusive
of all your practices,


406
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:37,878 line:-2
all features, and all
OS versions per platform.


407
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:41,215 line:-2
Labels must line up with your
App Tracking Transparency usage,


408
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:43,517 line:-2
which brings me
to the next topic.


409
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:47,988 align:center
App Tracking Transparency
was announced at WWDC 2020


410
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:53,160 align:center
and was required beginning
in spring 2021 with iOS 14.5.


411
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,362 line:0
Now, people can chose
whether they want to be


412
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,732 align:center
tracked across apps
and websites.


413
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,801 align:center
This lets people more
easily trust new apps,


414
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,437 line:0
and existing ones, too.


415
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:05,606 align:center
To request permission,
you'll need to provide


416
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:09,009 line:0
a purpose string explaining
why you want to track.


417
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,544 line:0
You can further explain by
putting


418
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,013 align:center
additional information
ahead of that prompt.


419
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,715 align:center
If you choose to take this
approach,


420
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,950 align:center
there are a few details
to keep in mind.


421
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,620 line:0
For example, you shouldn't
pre-prompt with a yes or no.


422
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,255 line:0
For more information,


423
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,224 line:0
refer to our
Human Interface Guidelines.


424
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,594 line:0
Now, some things to keep
in mind.


425
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:31,298 align:center
Tracking is about linking user
data across apps and websites


426
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:34,701 align:center
for advertising purposes
or sharing with data brokers.


427
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,837 line:0
For the detailed definition,


428
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:39,606 line:0
see the User Privacy
and Data Use page.


429
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:42,276 line:0
App Tracking Transparency
is about


430
00:20:42,276 --> 00:20:45,579 line:0
more than the IDFA, or
Identifier For Advertising.


431
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:49,516 line:0
The IDFA is one way to track,
but App Tracking Transparency


432
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:52,319 line:0
requires you to ask
permission for any tracking.


433
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,488 line:0
As part of your app's
functionality,


434
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:56,990 align:center
you might collect
names, email addresses,


435
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,426 line:0
or other identifiers.


436
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,428 align:center
Linking data using this
information


437
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,931 align:center
is also considered tracking.


438
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,300 line:0
Fingerprinting,
or the collection


439
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,168 align:center
of multiple bits of
information


440
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:10,671 align:center
to generate a stable
device identity,


441
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:13,640 align:center
is disallowed by the developer
program license agreement,


442
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,976 align:center
even if people give you
permission to track.


443
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,280 line:0
If tracking is denied,
all app functionality


444
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,449 align:center
must still be available.


445
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:25,552 line:0
Make sure that your
App Tracking Transparency usage


446
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,821 line:0
is reflected
in your Nutrition Label.


447
00:21:29.756 --> 00:21:31.725 line:-2 align:center
Many of you
embed third-party SDKs


448
00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:34.595 line:-2 align:center
to avoid reimplementing
functionality or to take


449
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:37,564 line:-2
advantage of helpful
third-party services.


450
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,434 line:-2
You need to be aware of what
those SDKs are doing.


451
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:43,103 line:-2
You're responsible for the
behavior of your whole app.


452
00:21:43.103 --> 00:21:45.372 line:-2 align:center
If an SDK collects data,
you need to


453
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:47,774 line:-2
put that behavior
on your Privacy Label.


454
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,476 line:-1
If an SDK is going to track,


455
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,178 line:-2
you need to get
people's permission


456
00:21:51.178 --> 00:21:53.280 line:-1 align:center
before calling those methods.


457
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,649 line:-1
Many SDKs have documentation


458
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,118 line:-2
related to the Privacy Nutrition
Label.


459
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:01,154 line:-2
You can also reach out
to them to ask.


460
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,892 line:-2
We know that advertising
is a key part of how our


461
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:07,427 line:-2
developers thrive,
so we've been hard at work


462
00:22:07.427 --> 00:22:11.365 line:-2 align:center
building privacy-preserving
ad-attribution technologies.


463
00:22:11.365 --> 00:22:13.100 line:-1 align:center
If you run ads in your app,


464
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.903 line:-2 align:center
pay for ads to grow
your customer base,


465
00:22:15.903 --> 00:22:18.005 line:-2 align:center
or work directly in the ad
ecosystem,


466
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,606 line:-2
here are some
of the improvements.


467
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:23,243 line:0
We added conversion values
and the source apps


468
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:25,712 align:center
when possible,
hardened fraud resilience,


469
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:28,849 align:center
provided credit for
alternate advertising flows,


470
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:31,485 line:0
launched privacy-preserving
web attribution,


471
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:34,254 align:center
provided accounting
for lost conversions,


472
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:36,790 line:0
further hardened
our privacy protections,


473
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,960 align:center
and now,
with iOS 15, we've added


474
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,529 align:center
a specific pingback to you
so you can measure


475
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:47,534 line:0
ad campaign performance without
help from the ad network.


476
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,304 line:0
For more information on all
these changes, check out


477
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:53,740 line:0
"Meetprivacy-preserving ad
attribution."


478
00:22:55.108 --> 00:22:56.410 line:-2 align:center
And that wraps up
our tour


479
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,612 align:center
through the transparency
and control pillar


480
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:01,148 align:center
and all the actions you'll need
to take with your apps.


481
00:23:03.116 --> 00:23:05.552 line:-2 align:center
The final privacy pillar
is security.


482
00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:08.155 line:-2 align:center
Security is a vital part of
some of the most well-known


483
00:23:08.155 --> 00:23:11.525 line:-2 align:center
features on our platform,
such as ensuring only the person


484
00:23:11.525 --> 00:23:14.528 line:-2 align:center
that you are iMessaging
can read your messages.


485
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:17,664 line:-2
As an example of how security
enables privacy,


486
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,766 line:-2
the iMessaging
privacy assurance


487
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,436 line:-2
is upheld
by end-to-end encryption.


488
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:24,938 line:-2
If you use
CloudKit for your app,


489
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:28,308 line:-2
we've got some new security
measures in store for you.


490
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:30,711 line:-2
You have always been able
to have CKAssets


491
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:33,213 line:-2
automatically encrypted
at rest with CloudKit.


492
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:37,451 line:-2
In iOS 15,
we provide functionality


493
00:23:37.451 --> 00:23:39.186 line:-2 align:center
so you're able to have
other data types


494
00:23:39.186 --> 00:23:41.755 line:-2 align:center
similarly protected
with strong encryption


495
00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:44.124 line:-1 align:center
by just calling a function.


496
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:47,027 line:-2
This means that where you were
previously handling encryption


497
00:23:47.027 --> 00:23:50.230 line:-2 align:center
of user data yourselves, now we
will provide the encryption


498
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.300 line:-2 align:center
and key management for all
data types stored in iCloud.


499
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,402 line:-2
We're now supporting strings,
numbers,


500
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:58,939 line:-1
dates, CLLocation and Arrays.


501
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.409 line:-1 align:center
And it's really easy!


502
00:24:02.409 --> 00:24:04.811 line:-2 align:center
You just set the key
value pair on the record


503
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:07,314 line:-1
using the encryptedValues API,


504
00:24:07.314 --> 00:24:10.918 line:-2 align:center
and CKModifyRecordsOperation
to save.


505
00:24:10.918 --> 00:24:12.853 line:-2 align:center
And to retrieve
the encrypted value,


506
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:14,988 line:-2
just call
CKFetchRecordsOperation


507
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:17,491 line:-2
with the same encryptedValues
property.


508
00:24:20.761 --> 00:24:23.297 line:-2 align:center
And now,
I'll hand it off to Elliot


509
00:24:23.297 --> 00:24:26.400 line:-2 align:center
to talk about Private Relay,
and how the privacy pillars


510
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.036 line:-2 align:center
helped shape
its design decisions.


511
00:24:29.036 --> 00:24:31.171 line:-1 align:center
[Elliot] Thanks, Garrett!


512
00:24:31.171 --> 00:24:34.241 line:-2 align:center
We use the internet throughout
our lives to express ourselves,


513
00:24:34.241 --> 00:24:37.611 line:-2 align:center
to connect us to work
and school, order food,


514
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:41.381 line:-2 align:center
and to help us learn new
things at developer conferences.


515
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:44,218 line:-2
Wi-Fi in a hotel,
cellular on the go,


516
00:24:44.218 --> 00:24:46.420 line:-2 align:center
and even the internet
in our homes--


517
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.156 line:-2 align:center
wherever you go,
and whatever network you use,


518
00:24:49.156 --> 00:24:53.026 line:-2 align:center
privacy on the internet
has never been more important.


519
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:55,362 line:-2
Let's walk through
my Sunday morning


520
00:24:55.362 --> 00:24:57.431 line:-2 align:center
after recently moving
to Cupertino.


521
00:24:57,431 --> 00:25:01,201 line:-2
After drinking a pot of coffee,
I sit down on my broken couch


522
00:25:01.201 --> 00:25:03.837 line:-2 align:center
and decide it's time
to get a new one.


523
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,739 line:-2
I like the couches
at Apple Park,


524
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:08,709 line:-2
so I open my Mac and browse
to Furniture Site in Safari


525
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:11,311 line:-1
to find some similar styles.


526
00:25:11.311 --> 00:25:12.980 line:-1 align:center
As soon as I connect,


527
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.617 line:-2 align:center
Furniture Site
has my IP address.


528
00:25:16.617 --> 00:25:19.119 line:-2 align:center
Which can be used to determine
which city I live in,


529
00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:23.924 line:-2 align:center
so Cupertino is also added
to my activity profile.


530
00:25:23.924 --> 00:25:25.893 line:-2 align:center
Behind the scenes,
Furniture Site,


531
00:25:25.893 --> 00:25:27.561 line:-1 align:center
like many other websites,


532
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:30,297 line:-2
gathers information about me
to share with data brokers.


533
00:25:32.299 --> 00:25:35.502 line:-2 align:center
Furniture Site contributes
the data about my couch browsing


534
00:25:35,502 --> 00:25:38,071 line:-2
and my IP address is used
to combine all of the other


535
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:41,775 line:-2
bits of data collected
about me from many other places.


536
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:44,077 align:center
When combined,
the bits and pieces form


537
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:46,647 line:0
a comprehensive profile
about what I do on the web.


538
00:25:49.049 --> 00:25:51.919 line:-2 align:center
Adding it all together,
the profile that is built


539
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,022 line:-2
represents a very personal
and up-to-date snapshot about


540
00:25:55.022 --> 00:25:58.959 line:-2 align:center
who I am and what's going
on in my life right now.


541
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:01,695 line:-2
My profile even includes
personal details,


542
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:04,598 line:-2
like my email address,
and even my home address


543
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:07,467 line:-2
that I shared to have
a table delivered.


544
00:26:07.467 --> 00:26:09.336 line:-2 align:center
I never provided
some of this information


545
00:26:09.336 --> 00:26:12.372 line:-2 align:center
intentionally or wanted it
to be shared.


546
00:26:12.372 --> 00:26:14.441 line:-2 align:center
This kind of browsing
history can't be cleared


547
00:26:14.441 --> 00:26:18.679 line:-2 align:center
or reset and isn't even
stored on my own devices.


548
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,148 align:center
Not only can this data
be used to serve ads


549
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:23,350 align:center
on other sites that I visit,
it can be used


550
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,385 align:center
to influence my behavior
without me knowing.


551
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:29,456 align:center
Later on Sunday,
I started researching


552
00:26:29,456 --> 00:26:31,658 line:0
lawn mowers on Lawn Mower Site.


553
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:34,494 line:0
Using my IP address and other
profile information,


554
00:26:34,494 --> 00:26:38,065 align:center
I was served an ad about
the couch that I looked at.


555
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:39,933 align:center
Two days later,
I received a couch catalog


556
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,469 align:center
in the mail
from Furniture Site.


557
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:45,772 line:0
Internet tracking doesn't always
stay on the internet.


558
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,174 align:center
With a detailed profile,


559
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:50,344 line:0
tracking can transition
to physical space.


560
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,679 line:0
Tracking reduces trust
and can lead people


561
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,215 align:center
to limit what they do
on your website.


562
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:58,218 align:center
Networks and equipment
makers are able to collect


563
00:26:58,218 --> 00:26:59,953 align:center
this type of information,
too,


564
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,788 align:center
even discover behavior
patterns


565
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,991 align:center
from people who
use your website or app.


566
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:08,128 align:center
Technologies like TLS
and encrypted DNS


567
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:11,098 align:center
help protect behavior patterns
and your users' data


568
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:13,300 align:center
from being exposed
to network providers.


569
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,936 line:0
You should
adopt these technologies.


570
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:18,906 align:center
To learn more about how to use
built-in ways to protect


571
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:22,676 line:0
internet privacy in apps,
check the "Enable Encrypted DNS"


572
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:25,479 line:0
and "Boost performance and
security with modern networking"


573
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:28,916 align:center
videos from WWDC 2020.


574
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:32,553 align:center
In iOS 15 and macOS Monterey,
we are introducing


575
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:36,423 align:center
iCloud Private Relay,
a new internet privacy service.


576
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:39,726 align:center
Included in iCloud+,
Private Relay makes sure


577
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:42,396 align:center
every internet connection
you make is encrypted,


578
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:44,965 line:0
and your IP address
no longer identifies you


579
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:48,702 align:center
or gives away your location
to websites in Safari.


580
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:51,772 align:center
And the best part, with
Private Relay's unique design,


581
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:53,540 align:center
no one, including Apple,


582
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,210 align:center
can see both who you are
and which websites you visit.


583
00:27:57,811 --> 00:28:00,047 align:center
Let's briefly explore
how Private Relay works


584
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:02,683 align:center
when I shop for my new home.


585
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:05,252 align:center
First, when making a connection
to Furniture Site,


586
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:08,255 align:center
two different Proxy operators
in the Private Relay Network


587
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:10,858 align:center
are randomly picked
so that no single operator


588
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:13,460 align:center
has control or can see
the whole picture.


589
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,996 line:-2
The proxy that accepts
my connection from


590
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:19,199 line:-2
the internet is called
the Ingress Proxy.


591
00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:21.401 line:-2 align:center
The Ingress Proxy prevents
other servers


592
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:23,036 line:-1
from seeing my IP address


593
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,872 line:-1
and encrypts my internet traffic


594
00:28:24.872 --> 00:28:26.406 line:-1 align:center
to prevent my network provider


595
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:28,342 line:-1
from knowing what I'm up to.


596
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:30,944 line:-2
The relay back
to the internet is provided


597
00:28:30.944 --> 00:28:34.214 line:-2 align:center
by the Egress Proxy,
which prevents the Ingress Proxy


598
00:28:34.214 --> 00:28:36.083 line:-2 align:center
from seeing what website
I'm contacting.


599
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:39,620 align:center
Private Relay manages
network access in a way


600
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,756 align:center
that doesn't require
identity or account information,


601
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:45,259 align:center
using RSA Blinded Signatures.


602
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:47,461 align:center
A cryptographic blinding
operation,


603
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:49,930 align:center
performed by my device,
lets me redeem it


604
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,432 line:0
for network access,
without giving away


605
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:55,669 align:center
any information about my account
or who's making the connection.


606
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,239 line:-2
Using the public key
from the Token server,


607
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:01,375 line:-2
a Private Relay Proxy
can quickly verify


608
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,809 line:-1
network access permission.


609
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:06,513 align:center
Before making a connection,


610
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:09,383 align:center
the Private Relay Access Token
Server provides a bundle


611
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:11,084 line:0
of different tokens to my
device.


612
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:14,888 line:0
This gives me access to any
proxy operator I choose,


613
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:16,657 align:center
whenever I need it.


614
00:29:17.758 --> 00:29:19.960 line:-2 align:center
To enforce the separation
of information between


615
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.362 line:-2 align:center
the proxies I picked,
the connection is built


616
00:29:22.362 --> 00:29:24.898 line:-2 align:center
using multiple
layers of encryption.


617
00:29:24.898 --> 00:29:27.000 line:-2 align:center
The proxies
remove layer-by-layer


618
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,670 line:-2
when the connection passes
through.


619
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.939 line:-2 align:center
Only my device
can decrypt every layer,


620
00:29:31.939 --> 00:29:34.641 line:-2 align:center
which is required to know that I
am accessing the Furniture Site.


621
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:37,544 line:-1
When making the connection,


622
00:29:37.544 --> 00:29:41.048 line:-2 align:center
the Egress Proxy randomly
selects an IP address to use.


623
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:43,650 line:-2
This helps to prevent linking
my couch search


624
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:47,120 line:-2
to my lawn mower search,
or my recent table delivery.


625
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,489 line:-2
Over time,
Private Relay connections


626
00:29:49.489 --> 00:29:51.859 line:-2 align:center
are automatically created
and reused


627
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,361 line:-2
to provide IP
address tracking protection


628
00:29:54.361 --> 00:29:57.364 line:-1 align:center
and good performance.


629
00:29:57.364 --> 00:29:59.333 line:-2 align:center
The way Private Relay
hides my IP address


630
00:29:59.333 --> 00:30:01.668 line:-1 align:center
has one more privacy benefit.


631
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:05,739 line:-2
Since my home IP address can be
geo-coded to my rough location,


632
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:09,376 line:-2
the Ingress Proxy can share
that location with me.


633
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:11,411 line:-2
This lets me inform
the Egress Proxy


634
00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:14.314 line:-2 align:center
which group of IP addresses
to choose between.


635
00:30:14.314 --> 00:30:18.285 line:-2 align:center
This is a great example of great
features and great privacy.


636
00:30:18.285 --> 00:30:21.822 line:-2 align:center
Websites can provide
local content in Safari,


637
00:30:21.822 --> 00:30:23.757 line:-2 align:center
while my precise location
stays hidden.


638
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:27,895 line:-2
Remember, the Ingress Proxy
is the only one


639
00:30:27.928 --> 00:30:30.631 line:-1 align:center
that can see my IP address,


640
00:30:30.664 --> 00:30:33.200 line:-2 align:center
The Ingress Proxy
converts my IP address


641
00:30:33.233 --> 00:30:34.868 line:-1 align:center
to the same IP-based area


642
00:30:34.902 --> 00:30:37.671 line:-2 align:center
that lawnmower site
would have seen,


643
00:30:37.704 --> 00:30:40.207 line:-2 align:center
then returns
an approximated version back.


644
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,076 align:center
In this example,
the Ingress Proxy sends back


645
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:47,648 line:0
"Bay Area, California," which is
forwarded to the Egress Proxy


646
00:30:47,648 --> 00:30:50,050 align:center
to help it pick from a group
of IP addresses


647
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,953 align:center
that are assigned
to that general area.


648
00:30:52,953 --> 00:30:55,656 align:center
With a regional IP address,
sites that I contact


649
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:57,591 line:0
can still find nearby stores.


650
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:00,694 line:0
Let's visualize how this works.


651
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:03,463 align:center
When I connect,
both sites see connections


652
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:07,367 line:0
coming from an IP address
that maps to my general area.


653
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,503 align:center
The dots on the map
represent possible


654
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:11,505 align:center
Private Relay IP address
locations


655
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:13,574 align:center
that are shared by
everyone in the region.


656
00:31:16.276 --> 00:31:18.478 line:-2 align:center
When the "Use Country
and Time Zone" option


657
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:21,181 line:-2
is selected in iCloud
Internet Privacy settings,


658
00:31:21.181 --> 00:31:23.550 line:-2 align:center
no hint is provided
to the Egress Proxy.


659
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:26,420 align:center
So, it picks a random
IP address from the group


660
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,255 align:center
that represents
the much larger region


661
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:30,791 line:0
that belongs
to the Ingress Proxy.


662
00:31:30.791 --> 00:31:33.093 line:-2 align:center
As a result,
websites will see connections


663
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:35,929 line:-2
being made
from a broad regional area.


664
00:31:35.929 --> 00:31:39.233 line:-2 align:center
The same set of IP addresses are
used by everyone in the region.


665
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,302 line:-2
With the more generalized
location setting,


666
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:45,339 line:-2
the Lawn Mower Site can now
see a randomized location,


667
00:31:45.339 --> 00:31:47.808 line:-2 align:center
which, for me,
can be places like Los Angeles


668
00:31:47.808 --> 00:31:49.743 line:-1 align:center
instead of Cupertino.


669
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:52,679 line:-2
Privacy on the internet
gets even better


670
00:31:52.679 --> 00:31:56.116 line:-2 align:center
when Private Relay and Hide
My Email are used together


671
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:59,086 line:-2
to prevent websites from
using your IP and email address


672
00:31:59.086 --> 00:32:01.855 line:-2 align:center
to track your activity
across the web.


673
00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:05,158 line:-2
We've gone over how iCloud
Private Relay demonstrates


674
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:08,161 line:-2
key concepts
from our privacy pillars.


675
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:11,198 align:center
The data minimization
concept is illustrated by


676
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:14,268 line:0
using unlinkable tokens
for network access.


677
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:17,337 align:center
Only devices are able
to process and decrypt


678
00:32:17,337 --> 00:32:20,974 align:center
all of the encryption layers
in a Private Relay connection.


679
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:23,343 align:center
IP address protections
enhance control


680
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,746 align:center
over tracking on the internet.


681
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:28,815 line:0
Layered encryption and strong
security enforces control


682
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:32,119 align:center
over who can access
internet browsing content.


683
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:35,155 line:0
Our privacy pillars have helped
us every step of the way


684
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:37,324 line:0
when designing
iCloud Private Relay.


685
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:38,692 line:-1
Back to Lauren.


686
00:32:38.692 --> 00:32:40.460 line:-1 align:center
[Lauren] Thanks, Elliot.


687
00:32:40.494 --> 00:32:43.564 line:-2 align:center
Great features and great
privacy becomes easier


688
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:45,832 line:-1
when we all work together.


689
00:32:45.866 --> 00:32:49.169 line:-2 align:center
We hope that learning about
the new improvements in iOS 15


690
00:32:49.169 --> 00:32:51.872 line:-2 align:center
and how Apple builds
privacy into our products,


691
00:32:51.872 --> 00:32:54.608 line:-2 align:center
like Private Relay,
has inspired you to consider


692
00:32:54.608 --> 00:32:57.644 line:-2 align:center
opportunities for innovation
when building your app.


693
00:32:58.612 --> 00:33:02.883 line:-2 align:center
To better protect people's data,
encrypt new assets in CloudKit.


694
00:33:02.883 --> 00:33:05.185 line:-2 align:center
For seamless
location-based features,


695
00:33:05.185 --> 00:33:08.121 line:-2 align:center
adopt the Share Current Location
button.


696
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:11,158 line:-2
Lastly, check your
Record App Activity log


697
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,427 line:-2
to prepare for
the App Privacy Report


698
00:33:13.427 --> 00:33:16.196 line:-2 align:center
and ensure it aligns
with your nutrition label.


699
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:19.333 line:-2 align:center
Apple builds tools
with privacy in mind


700
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,134 line:-2
so that you
can build great apps


701
00:33:21.134 --> 00:33:23.036 line:-1 align:center
for anyone on the platform.


702
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:26,039 line:-2
Having an ecosystem
where people are excited


703
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:29,009 line:-2
to explore new apps
and try new features


704
00:33:29.009 --> 00:33:31.979 line:-2 align:center
while feeling in control
of how their data is being used


705
00:33:31.979 --> 00:33:35.649 line:-2 align:center
relies on all of us
doing our best work.


706
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:40,187 line:-2
iOS 15 and macOS Monterey
provide more control and insight


707
00:33:40.187 --> 00:33:44.258 line:-2 align:center
than ever before, and we're so
excited to see what you build.
