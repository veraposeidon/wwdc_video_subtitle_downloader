Rajesh Ambati: Hi,
I am Raj Ambati.


7
00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.313 line:-1 position:50%
I lead 5G software development
at Apple


8
00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.315 line:-1 position:50%
and I’m excited
to talk to you about 5G,


9
00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.451 line:-1 position:50%
so let’s dig in.


10
00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:19.253 line:-1 position:50%
Over the course
of this short presentation,


11
00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.955 line:-1 position:50%
I will cover on three main areas,


12
00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.725 line:-1 position:50%
beginning with a bit
of background on the path to 5G


13
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:27,594 line:-1
and why we think
it’s a big deal.


14
00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.730 line:-1 position:50%
I will share
how iPadOS and iOS


15
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.099 line:-1 position:50%
balance network performance
and battery life


16
00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.702 line:-1 position:50%
all while preserving
a great user experience,


17
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,437 line:-1
and leave you with
some practical guidance


18
00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:41.808 line:-1 position:50%
you can use to ensure your app
is optimized for 5G.


19
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,445 line:-1
So let me begin
with the path to 5G.


20
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,115 line:-1
For me, one of the best ways
to convey the potential


21
00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:52.719 line:-1 position:50%
of modern 5G networks
is to take a step back.


22
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.254 line:-1 position:50%
Now, I’m guessing
not many of you


23
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,423 line:-1
owned one of these
sweet portable phones.


24
00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.958 line:-1 position:50%
But, I think it’s important
to understand


25
00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.560 line:-1 position:50%
that they were a big deal
in their day.


26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,362 line:-1
With this handy device,
you could actually


27
00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.965 line:-1 position:50%
make a telephone call
while on the go.


28
00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:06.900 line:-1 position:50%
And while, of course,
our modern iPhone


29
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.803 line:-1 position:50%
still lets you make calls,
so much of the other


30
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,872 line:-1
amazing things you can do
with your iPhone


31
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:14,775 line:-1
is the result of advances
in networking technology.


32
00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:17.044 line:-1 position:50%
Each step in network evolution
has brought


33
00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:20.480 line:-1 position:50%
dramatically new capabilities
to mobile devices.


34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,816 line:-1
2G networks, for example,
were the first networks


35
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,985 line:-1
to provide data services
for mobile.


36
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,187 line:-1
So not only could you
make a phone call,


37
00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:28.922 line:-1 position:50%
but you could do
dramatically new things


38
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,525 line:-1
such as having
a voice-free conversation


39
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,894 line:-1
by sending SMS text messages;


40
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:37,030 line:-1
capture pictures and immediately
send them to your friends;


41
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.066 line:-1 position:50%
or deliver a variety of media,


42
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:43.270 line:-1 position:50%
including up to multiple images,
video, and audio,


43
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.041 line:-1 position:50%
all at the blistering speed of
up to 384 kilobits per second.


44
00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.510 line:-1 position:50%
And while this is probably
considered slow,


45
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,180 line:-1
the fact you could do
these amazing new things


46
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,682 line:-1
with a mobile device meant
the performance of the network


47
00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.185 line:-1 position:50%
didn’t really matter as much.


48
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,920 line:-1
But of course,
once we developers


49
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.555 line:-1 position:50%
have access to a network,


50
00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:04.157 line:-1 position:50%
our goal is to push it
to its limits.


51
00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:07.361 line:-1 position:50%
So 2G networks
really were only the beginning


52
00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:11.331 line:-1 position:50%
of a continuous strive
to deliver more data, faster.


53
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:14.134 line:-1 position:50%
3G came along with primary focus
on data connectivity


54
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,602 line:-1
and unlocked new capabilities


55
00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:20.340 line:-1 position:50%
such as video calls, mobile TV,
and even internet access.


56
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,443 line:-1
Imagine what a breakthrough
3G was at the time!


57
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,313 line:-1
Having a web browser
on your phone was amazing;


58
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,783 line:-1
it put the entire internet
in your pocket!


59
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:33,320 line:-1
4G -- or what’s more commonly
called LTE -- came next,


60
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,556 line:-1
and with it,
data rates improved even more.


61
00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:40.527 line:-1 position:50%
LTE enabled reliable mobile
voice over IP communication,


62
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,163 line:-1
support for streaming
high-quality video,


63
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.566 line:-1 position:50%
and many other data-intensive
user experiences


64
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,935 line:-1
we’ve come to love


65
00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:52.639 line:-1 position:50%
like communicating with
your family using FaceTime video


66
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,610 line:-1
or exploring shared augmented
reality experiences


67
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.180 line:-1 position:50%
or real-time multiplayer
games and more.


68
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,950 line:-1
Those fantastic new experiences
that we’ve come to rely on


69
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,319 line:-1
were made possible
by the dramatic increase


70
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,790 line:-1
in network performance
over the previous generation.


71
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.226 line:-1 position:50%
But again, we are always
looking to push the envelope;


72
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,863 line:-1
to deliver more services
and breakthrough experiences,


73
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:20.567 line:-1 position:50%
and of course, deliver them
at faster speeds.


74
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:25,372 line:-1
And that brings us to the latest
technology in networking, 5G.


75
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,374 line:-1
5G continues the evolution


76
00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:30.177 line:-1 position:50%
of our ever-increasing
need for speed.


77
00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:33.246 line:-1 position:50%
And if you step back and take
a look at network performance


78
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,316 position:50%
over these generations,
you can see each new generation


79
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,985 line:0
delivered a remarkable
increase in speed


80
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,521 position:50%
at which the data
can be delivered.


81
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:45,158 line:0
Each jump in speed leads
to a leap in the possibilities


82
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,760 position:50%
for you to provide richer --


83
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,463 position:50%
or in many cases,
previously impossible --


84
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,998 line:0
experiences in your app.


85
00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:55.735 line:-1 position:50%
But while 5G is an incredible
jump in performance


86
00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.038 line:-1 position:50%
from a network bandwidth
perspective,


87
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,107 line:-1
5G provides other advances


88
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,810 line:-1
beyond just more data
at a faster rate.


89
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,613 line:-1
So not only can you
exchange data faster,


90
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,448 line:-1
but you’ll have
faster round-trip times


91
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,584 line:-1
between your app
and your server.


92
00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.853 line:-1 position:50%
And faster round trips
mean faster


93
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,555 line:-1
and more synchronized
transactions.


94
00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:18.892 line:-1 position:50%
5G’s ability to handle
more devices concurrently


95
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,494 line:-1
means you can
continue to deliver


96
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,096 line:-1
data-related services
in your app,


97
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,432 line:-1
even in congested
public environments


98
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,435 line:-1
such as sports stadiums,
convention arenas,


99
00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.470 line:-1 position:50%
and other crowded
public venues --


100
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.572 line:-1 position:50%
remember those?


101
00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:35.575 line:-1 position:50%
And given that 5G’s performance
is 10 times better


102
00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:37.878 line:-1 position:50%
than a typical public Wi-Fi,


103
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,313 line:-1
this means your customers
won’t have to hop on


104
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,483 line:-1
potentially insecure
Wi-Fi hotspots


105
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,920 line:-1
just to quickly exchange
larger files.


106
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,689 line:-1
So that was a brief review
of the network generations


107
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,726 line:-1
leading to 5G,
each leap in performance


108
00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.561 line:-1 position:50%
resulting in increased
opportunities


109
00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:57.964 line:-1 position:50%
for app developers like you
to push the envelope


110
00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.600 line:-1 position:50%
and deliver previously
unheard-of experiences


111
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.868 line:-1 position:50%
in your app.


112
00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:03.403 line:-1 position:50%
Now, I’d like to transition


113
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,505 line:-1
from a focus on performance
of the network


114
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:09,042 line:-1
to describe the services
we’ve built into iOS


115
00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:12.078 line:-1 position:50%
that ensure your app
will perform optimally,


116
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,382 line:-1
regardless of
the network environment.


117
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,084 position:50%
Looking back at the major
milestones of networking,


118
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:22,189 position:50%
it is easy to think that as each
new network came into being,


119
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:26,193 line:0
the previous network disappeared
into the dustbin of history.


120
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,929 line:0
But like any
evolutionary process,


121
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:33,967 line:0
there are always portions of the
past in the next generation.


122
00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:37.771 line:-1 position:50%
So the reality is that today’s
modern 5G cellular networks


123
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:39.639 line:-1 position:50%
can be a bit of an amalgam,


124
00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.143 line:-1 position:50%
but come primarily
in two varieties,


125
00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:47.214 line:-1 position:50%
commonly referred to as
Non-Standalone and Standalone --


126
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:52,018 line:-1
or even more commonly
referred to as NSA and SA.


127
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,722 line:-1
Non-Standalone is built
on the existing LTE core


128
00:05:55,722 --> 00:06:00,327 line:-1
and can use both LTE and 5G
links to schedule traffic,


129
00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:03.263 line:-1 position:50%
operates at frequencies
below seven gigahertz,


130
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,499 line:-1
and includes support
for millimeter wave.


131
00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.804 line:-1 position:50%
Standalone is built entirely
on the new 5G core,


132
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,506 line:-1
also operates at frequencies
below seven gigahertz,


133
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,309 line:-1
and includes support
for millimeter wave,


134
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:21,014 line:-1
and delivers improved
latency performance over LTE.


135
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,650 line:0
These unique characteristics
of 5G deployments


136
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,018 line:0
play a critical role
in determining


137
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,320 position:50%
the network performance
of your app.


138
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.756 line:-1 position:50%
And the upside is huge,


139
00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:32.626 line:-1 position:50%
especially with
ideal theoretical speeds


140
00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:36.496 line:-1 position:50%
of up to 4 gigabits per second.


141
00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:40.467 line:-1 position:50%
And this real-world test
I recently ran at Apple Park


142
00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:42.269 line:-1 position:50%
shows me getting close,


143
00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:46.139 line:-1 position:50%
clocking in at a wicked fast
3 gigabits per second!


144
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,808 line:-1
That’s 20 times faster than LTE.


145
00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:51.411 line:-1 position:50%
And with a ping latency
of seven milliseconds,


146
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:56.549 line:-1 position:50%
it’s pretty obvious there’s
a lot you can do with 5G.


147
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,086 line:-1
However, while 5G deployments
provide lower latency


148
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.955 line:-1 position:50%
and faster data speeds,


149
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:05,592 line:-1
they are inherently
more power hungry.


150
00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:09.396 line:-1 position:50%
Sure, the people using your app
want a superfast experience,


151
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:13,099 line:-1
but not necessarily
at the expense of battery life.


152
00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.635 line:-1 position:50%
So we’ve taken this desire
for a balance


153
00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:18.938 line:-1 position:50%
between power and performance
into consideration


154
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,075 line:-1
and made optimizations
at the system level


155
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:26,012 line:-1
so you can focus
on user experience.


156
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:30,116 position:50%
If we go back to look
at our 5G deployments


157
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,919 position:50%
and toss public Wi-Fi networks
into the mix,


158
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,188 position:50%
you can see there’s
a range of network types


159
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,357 position:50%
with varied performance
characteristics


160
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:41,261 line:0
that we can pick from to provide
the best connection speed


161
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,930 line:0
for a given task
in your app.


162
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.100 line:-1 position:50%
And we pick the best network
using two techniques


163
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,807 line:-1
called "Automatic Switch to 5G"
and "Smart Data Mode."


164
00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:57.610 line:-1 position:50%
Both technologies look
at a combination of performance,


165
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.447 line:-1 position:50%
security,
and power characteristics


166
00:08:00.447 --> 00:08:04.918 line:-1 position:50%
to enable the best wireless
connection for your app,


167
00:08:04.918 --> 00:08:09.356 line:-1 position:50%
be it Wi-Fi, LTE, or 5G.


168
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,391 line:-1
In addition
to constantly evaluating


169
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:15.128 line:-1 position:50%
the relative performance of LTE,
5G, and Wi-Fi,


170
00:08:15.128 --> 00:08:17.931 line:-1 position:50%
Smart Data Mode
can detect network congestion


171
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:20.467 line:-1 position:50%
on any network
and move your connection


172
00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:24.671 line:-1 position:50%
to the wireless interface
with the least resistance.


173
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,706 line:-1
They also look at the security
of the available


174
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,575 line:-1
Wi-Fi connection
with the assumption


175
00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:32.612 line:-1 position:50%
that public Wi-Fi at airports,
coffee shops, et cetera


176
00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.914 line:-1 position:50%
are usually less secure
than cellular


177
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,852 line:-1
and typically provide
very low data speeds.


178
00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.888 line:-1 position:50%
And battery considerations
also take into account


179
00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:43.923 line:-1 position:50%
the most power-efficient network


180
00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:46.259 line:-1 position:50%
for a given task
within your app,


181
00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:49.929 line:-1 position:50%
such as switching to 5G
knowing it’s more efficient


182
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,866 line:-1
for large file use cases
like movie downloads,


183
00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:56.169 line:-1 position:50%
or switching to LTE
for low data-intensive tasks,


184
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,105 line:-1
like those typically
run in the background.


185
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,940 line:-1
So with all the built-in
services


186
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,810 line:-1
managing the network interface
on your behalf,


187
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,114 line:-1
it’s easy to ignore
the type of network altogether.


188
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,717 line:-1
And with that review
of the built-in features,


189
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:14.320 line:-1 position:50%
I have a perfect segue to
provide some practical guidance


190
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,024 line:-1
for ensuring your app
is optimized for 5G.


191
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,927 line:-1
And I’ve already hinted
at the first best practice


192
00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:22.562 line:-1 position:50%
in the previous section.


193
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,565 line:-1
With the system choosing
the best network on your behalf,


194
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:29.068 line:-1 position:50%
you should stop even considering
the network type.


195
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,005 line:-1
Using network type
to drive behavior


196
00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:34.441 line:-1 position:50%
is just about guaranteed
to prevent your app


197
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:37.844 line:-1 position:50%
from accessing
the potential 5G benefits.


198
00:09:37.844 --> 00:09:42.182 line:-1 position:50%
Also, don’t assume if Wi-Fi
is available, cellular isn’t


199
00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:46.352 line:-1 position:50%
because we support
multiple network paths.


200
00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:49.255 line:-1 position:50%
My next best practice
is to use our frameworks


201
00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:52.058 line:-1 position:50%
to take full advantage of 5G.


202
00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:55.261 line:-1 position:50%
For example, you should be
using AVFoundation,


203
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.298 line:-1 position:50%
like we do on Apple TV
and in Apple Music,


204
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:02,168 line:-1
to stream high-quality
audio and video;


205
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,205 line:-1
or CallKit to take advantage
of the noticeable


206
00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:09.776 line:-1 position:50%
enhancements we’ve added
for VOIP apps on 5G.


207
00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:13.546 line:-1 position:50%
Using high-level network APIs
such as URLSession


208
00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:16.783 line:-1 position:50%
and the Network framework,
we’ve been able to tune


209
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:21,254 line:-1
many of our apps
to take full advantage of 5G.


210
00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:26.593 line:-1 position:50%
Apple News will cache articles
over 5G for offline reading.


211
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,162 line:-1
Now your favorite photos
get synced to iCloud


212
00:10:29.162 --> 00:10:32.131 line:-1 position:50%
over the inexpensive 5G link.


213
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,902 line:-1
And we’ve enabled automatic
backup and restore over 5G


214
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:39,272 line:-1
when Wi-Fi isn’t available.


215
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,741 line:-1
My third best practice
is to tune your application


216
00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:45.311 line:-1 position:50%
for constrained
and expensive paths.


217
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,181 line:-1
In most cases,
expensive and constrained


218
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,316 line:-1
are automatically
derived by the system


219
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,853 line:-1
based on
the active cellular plan.


220
00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:56.422 line:-1 position:50%
However, the user
can also affect these


221
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,727 line:-1
by altering the Data Mode
settings on their device.


222
00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:04.631 line:-1 position:50%
There are three options:
Allow More Data on 5G,


223
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,901 line:-1
indicating an inexpensive path,
similar to Wi-Fi;


224
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:08,902 line:-1
Standard mode,


225
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,137 line:-1
which is usually considered as expensive;


226
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:15,275 line:-1
and Low Data Mode,
which is considered constrained.


227
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,710 line:-1
The concept of expensive
and constrained


228
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,145 line:-1
are surfaced as properties


229
00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:22.081 line:-1 position:50%
in all our high-level
networking frameworks.


230
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:23.616 line:-1 position:50%
And the value
of these properties


231
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,285 line:-1
should be your
only consideration


232
00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:27.420 line:-1 position:50%
when determining
the type of network services


233
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.689 line:-1 position:50%
available for your app.


234
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,692 line:0
For example,
URLSession allows you


235
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694 line:0
to take advantage
of these properties


236
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,063 line:0
to manage networking requests.


237
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,934 position:50%
In order to benefit from
inexpensive networking over 5G,


238
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,036 position:50%
we recommend you use


239
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,039 line:0
allowsExpensiveNetworkAccess


240
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,842 line:0
instead of relying
on network type checks.


241
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,012 line:-1
In addition, if your application
implements policy


242
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,647 line:-1
based on expensive,


243
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:59,252 line:-1
provide a way for users
to influence that policy.


244
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,854 line:-1
In Network.framework,
you have another option


245
00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:08.161 line:-1 position:50%
to check for constrained,
expensive, and inexpensive path.


246
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:11,431 line:-1
And finally, if your app
uses AVFoundation,


247
00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:12.599 line:-1 position:50%
there are similar case


248
00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:17.870 line:-1 position:50%
indicating constrained
and expensive here as well.


249
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.040 line:-1 position:50%
So those are my best practices
for ensuring your app


250
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,277 line:-1
is ready to take advantage
of 5G.


251
00:12:24.277 --> 00:12:27.447 line:-1 position:50%
The key takeaway ideally
is to let the operating system


252
00:12:27.447 --> 00:12:31.150 line:-1 position:50%
and iOS frameworks
do the heavy lifting.


253
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,353 line:-1
We’ve covered a fair amount
in this session,


254
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,622 line:-1
from a bit of a history lesson
to a deep dive


255
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,358 line:-1
on how the system works,
to some tips to make sure


256
00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:41.194 line:-1 position:50%
you are getting the most
out of the network.


257
00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:42.862 line:-1 position:50%
But before I sign off,


258
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,765 line:-1
let me leave you
with a few key takeaways.


259
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,401 line:-1
First, 5G is here.


260
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,970 line:-1
While you may not have it
available in your neighborhood,


261
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.239 line:-1 position:50%
a good percentage
of your customers do --


262
00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:55.208 line:-1 position:50%
or it’s just around
the corner --


263
00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:57.210 line:-1 position:50%
so you want to be ready.


264
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,946 line:-1
Remember that we are
continually working on ways


265
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,881 line:-1
to leverage
our unique combination


266
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,850 line:-1
of hardware and software


267
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,419 line:-1
to ensure a high-performance
user experience


268
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:10,289 line:-1
while maintaining the longest
possible battery life.


269
00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.592 line:-1 position:50%
And by using
our high-level frameworks,


270
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,895 line:-1
your app can benefit
with minimal effort.


271
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,464 line:-1
And finally, we’re always
looking for ways


272
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:19.832 line:-1 position:50%
to engage with you.


273
00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:22.735 line:-1 position:50%
So please give us feedback
on how our networking tools


274
00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:25.338 line:-1 position:50%
are or are not
fitting your needs.


275
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:29,142 line:-1
And if you have 5G use cases you
find particularly interesting,


276
00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.744 line:-1 position:50%
we would love to hear
about that as well.


277
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,912 line:-1
Thank you!
