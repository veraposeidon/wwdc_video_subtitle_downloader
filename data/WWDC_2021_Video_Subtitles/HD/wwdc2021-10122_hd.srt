Preston Lewis: Hi,
my name is Preston,


7
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,013 line:-1
and today I'm going
to be talking about


8
00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:17.050 line:-1 position:50%
how to bring accessibility
to charts in your apps.


9
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.553 line:-1 position:50%
Let's go over
what we're going to cover today.


10
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,521 line:-1
First, we'll talk about
some of the benefits


11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,758 line:-1
of making your charts
accessible.


12
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,260 line:-1
Then, we'll go over
some principles


13
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,794 line:-1
for making inclusive decisions


14
00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:31.265 line:-1 position:50%
for the visual aspects
of your chart.


15
00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:33.200 line:-1 position:50%
Next, we'll discuss how to make
your charts


16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,237 line:-1
perceivable and navigable
with VoiceOver.


17
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,040 line:-1
And lastly, we'll talk about
an exciting new feature


18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,578 line:-1
called "audio graphs" and how
to support them in your app.


19
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,680 line:-1
So, let's get started.


20
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.549 line:-1 position:50%
Data is so important
in our modern world.


21
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:54,154 line:-1
We use data every day to make
decisions about our finances,


22
00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:58.792 line:-1 position:50%
our health, our goals,
and so many other things.


23
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,794 line:-1
But in order to make
any use of data,


24
00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.963 line:-1 position:50%
we have to be able
to understand it.


25
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,632 line:-1
Charts are useful because they
allow us to quickly understand


26
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,200 line:-1
what our data is telling us


27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,970 line:-1
without having to get too deep
into the details.


28
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,838 line:-1
But charts are not
inherently accessible


29
00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.141 line:-1 position:50%
for blind or low-vision people.


30
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.210 line:-1 position:50%
There's no value in a visual
chart if you can't see it.


31
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.579 line:-1 position:50%
The accessibility team has been
working hard for years


32
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,783 line:-1
to make data more accessible
to blind and low-vision people.


33
00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:25.052 line:-1 position:50%
This year, you can bring
the full power of your charts


34
00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:26.586 line:-1 position:50%
to people with blindness
or low vision


35
00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.122 line:-1 position:50%
by supporting audio graphs
in your apps.


36
00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:32.759 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at an example.


37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,329 line:-1
Here is an example app showing
historical birth rates


38
00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.398 line:-1 position:50%
from the year 1917 to 1975.


39
00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:39.599 line:-1 position:50%
When you look at this chart,


40
00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.802 line:-1 position:50%
you can immediately see
some interesting features.


41
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,271 line:-1
You can see that the birth rate
decreased to a minimum


42
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:46.006 line:-1 position:50%
around the year 1935,


43
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,775 line:-1
and then quickly increased
to about the year 1960


44
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.544 line:-1 position:50%
and then decreased again.


45
00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:53.113 line:-1 position:50%
We can give blind and low-vision
people the same ability


46
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,514 line:-1
to quickly get
a sense of the data


47
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,284 line:-1
using the new audio graph
VoiceOver feature.


48
00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:58.852 line:-1 position:50%

Preston: Wasn't that exciting?


66
00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.066 line:-1 position:50%
What you just heard was the same
chart as the one you see,


67
00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.535 line:-1 position:50%
represented auditorily
instead of visually.


68
00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.371 line:-1 position:50%
The pitches you heard correspond
to birth rates over time


69
00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.240 line:-1 position:50%
with lower pitches
meaning lower values


70
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,675 line:-1
and higher pitches
meaning higher values.


71
00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.612 line:-1 position:50%
These pitches exactly mirror
the line in the visual chart.


72
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,213 line:-1
So even without seeing
the chart,


73
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,582 line:-1
the audio graph allows you to
perceive its important features


74
00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.518 line:-1 position:50%
in just a few seconds.


75
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,486 line:-1
Now that we have
a general sense of the data,


76
00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.155 line:-1 position:50%
let's get more precise
information


77
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,557 line:-1
about the features
we're interested in.


78
00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.025 line:-1 position:50%
The next thing
we might want to know


79
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.261 line:-1 position:50%
is approximately what
the maximum birth rate was


80
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.963 line:-1 position:50%
and what year it occurred.


81
00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:19.900 line:-1 position:50%
To do this, audio graphs
provide an interactive mode


82
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,135 line:-1

can double-tap and hold


83

to the data at their own pace.

will read the data value

95
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,941 line:-1
then pausing to hear
the data value,


96
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,642 line:-1
we can tell that
the maximum birth rate


97
00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:07.247 line:-1 position:50%
was 268 per 10,000 people
around the year 1960.


98
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.050 line:-1 position:50%
Because we know the maximum
occurred around 1960,


99
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,318 line:-1
we might even be able to infer


100
00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:14.221 line:-1 position:50%
that this peak corresponds
to the baby boom era.


101
00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:15.822 line:-1 position:50%
We can figure all of this out

each tone you hear
will represent a data point


110

111
00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:43.450 line:-1 position:50%

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.658 line:-1 position:50%
And lastly, with new API
coming this year,


160
00:06:31.658 --> 00:06:34.261 line:-1 position:50%
making your charts
is easier than ever before.


161
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,528 line:-1
I'm really excited to show you


162
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,430 line:-1
how to support audio graphs
in your apps,


163
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.832 line:-1 position:50%
but we need to cover
some general


164
00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:40.400 line:-1 position:50%
chart accessibility
topics first,


165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,768 line:-1
starting with how
you can make your charts


166
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,970 line:-1
more visually accessible.


167
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,639 line:-1
There are a few simple things
you can do


168
00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.908 line:-1 position:50%
to make your visual charts more
understandable for everybody.


169
00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.578 line:-1 position:50%
Take this chart as an example.


170
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.714 line:-1 position:50%
This is simple line chart that
shows average monthly rainfall


171
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,484 line:-1
for tropical and arid regions.


172
00:06:57.484 --> 00:06:59.419 line:-1 position:50%
Let's apply some
accessibility principles


173
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.722 line:-1 position:50%
to improve the visual
accessibility of this chart.


174
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,058 line:-1
First, it's important to use
high-contrast colors


175
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,993 line:-1
whenever possible.


176
00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:09.362 line:-1 position:50%
High contrast between
foreground and background colors


177
00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.798 line:-1 position:50%
makes your chart easier
to look at and understand,


178
00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:14.434 line:-1 position:50%
especially for people
with low vision.


179
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,303 line:-1
As you can see,
the lines' contrast


180
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:19,105 line:-1
against their background
is pretty low.


181
00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:22.442 line:-1 position:50%
The title and label text
also seem a bit dim.


182
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,444 line:-1
Let's update these colors
to have higher contrast


183
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,714 line:-1
against the background.


184
00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:29.249 line:-1 position:50%
That's much better.


185
00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:31.251 line:-1 position:50%
You can check contrast
ratios between colors


186
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,954 line:-1
to determine whether or not
the contrast is sufficient.


187
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,957 line:-1
The Accessibility Inspector
that comes bundled with Xcode


188
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,628 line:-1
has a Color Contrast Calculator
that you can use.


189
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,932 line:-1
It's good to aim for contrast
ratios of at least 4.5:1.


190
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,067 line:-1
The next thing you can do


191
00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:48.968 line:-1 position:50%
to improve your chart's
visual accessibility


192
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,538 line:-1
is to avoid problematic
color pairings.


193
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,073 line:-1
It's generally good practice


194
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:56,242 line:-1
to avoid using red and green
together if possible.


195
00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:58.611 line:-1 position:50%
Red and green color blindness
is the most common type


196
00:07:58.611 --> 00:07:59.879 line:-1 position:50%
and using these colors together


197
00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:03.216 line:-1 position:50%
can make your chart difficult
to understand for some people.


198
00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:04.651 line:-1 position:50%
So here's the line chart again,


199
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,320 line:-1
with a green line representing
rainfall in tropical regions


200
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.090 line:-1 position:50%
and a red line representing
rainfall in arid regions.


201
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.392 line:-1 position:50%
You can probably tell
which data series is which


202
00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:15.328 line:-1 position:50%
using the color encoding
in the legend.


203
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,730 line:-1
But if you have deuteranopia,


204
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,565 line:-1
a form of red-green
color blindness,


205
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,967 line:-1
the chart might look something
more like this to you.


206
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,302 line:-1
It would be hard for you to tell


207
00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:24.037 line:-1 position:50%
which line represents
tropical rainfall


208
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,006 line:-1
and which line represents
arid rainfall with these colors.


209
00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:31.911 line:-1 position:50%
Let's improve this by replacing
the red color with blue.


210
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:33.813 line:-1 position:50%
This might not seem
like a huge change,


211
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,648 line:-1
but to someone with
red-green color blindness,


212
00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:39.119 line:-1 position:50%
this chart might now
look like this.


213
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,553 line:-1
With this small adjustment,


214
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,689 line:-1
it becomes easy for someone
with red-green colorblindness


215
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,126 line:-1
to spot the difference
between the series.


216
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,561 line:-1
It's also good to avoid using
blue and yellow together


217
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,029 line:-1
because this family
of color blindness


218
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,233 line:-1
is the second most common.


219
00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:54.667 line:-1 position:50%
These are some
good improvements,


220
00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.369 line:-1 position:50%
but let's take this
one step further


221
00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.238 line:-1 position:50%
by using symbols
in addition to color


222
00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:01.107 line:-1 position:50%
for distinguishing
your data series.


223
00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:03.676 line:-1 position:50%
Using data symbols makes it so
that people can understand


224
00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:06.312 line:-1 position:50%
your chart without having
to rely on color at all.


225
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,847 line:-1
So here's our chart again.


226
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:11,785 line:-1
And now let's add some symbols
for each data series.


227
00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:14.521 line:-1 position:50%
Notice the tropical data series
has circles now,


228
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:16.990 line:-1 position:50%
and the arid data series
has squares.


229
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,725 line:-1
You can tell which series
is which now


230
00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.961 line:-1 position:50%
just by looking
at the associated symbols.


231
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:24.831 line:-1 position:50%
This means that even a person
who can't perceive color at all


232
00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:27.467 line:-1 position:50%
can now understand your chart.


233
00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:29.402 line:-1 position:50%
It's good to do all of
these things by default,


234
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.337 line:-1 position:50%
but again, sometimes design
or product constraints


235
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,906 line:-1
might limit
your choice of colors


236
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,841 line:-1
or decision to include symbols.


237
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,410 line:-1
In these cases, you can still
provide an accessible experience


238
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,213 line:-1
by supporting a few simple
accessibility settings.


239
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,482 line:-1
If you can't have symbols in
your chart for the default case,


240
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,184 line:-1
you can still provide
an accessible experience


241
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,886 line:-1
by adding symbols when the
Differentiate Without Color


242
00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:50.056 line:-1 position:50%
system accessibility
setting is enabled.


243
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,725 line:-1
If you can't easily change your
color set for product reasons,


244
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,761 line:-1
consider adopting
higher-contrast colors


245
00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:58.731 line:-1 position:50%
when the Increase Contrast
accessibility setting is set.


246
00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:00.133 line:-1 position:50%
Reducing the use of transparency


247
00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:03.069 line:-1 position:50%
can also make your chart
more visually accessible.


248
00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:04.971 line:-1 position:50%
If your chart uses
transparency effects,


249
00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:07.106 line:-1 position:50%
consider disabling them
when the Reduce Transparency


250
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,309 line:-1
accessibility setting is on.


251
00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:11.911 line:-1 position:50%
If you're building a macOS
rather than an iOS app,


252
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.180 line:-1 position:50%
each of these settings
has a counterpart on macOS


253
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,115 line:-1
that you can support.


254
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,718 line:-1
You'll find links to developer
documentation for these APIs


255
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,354 line:-1
in the materials
for this session.


256
00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:23.223 line:-1 position:50%
Now let's look at how we can
make your data navigable


257
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,424 line:-1
for VoiceOver.


258
00:10:24.424 --> 00:10:27.460 line:-1 position:50%
Now, I love coffee,
and I love programming.


259
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,162 line:-1
Let's pretend for a minute
there's a relationship


260
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,663 line:-1
between the amount
of coffee consumed


261
00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:33.833 line:-1 position:50%
and amount of code an engineer
produces as shown in this chart.


262
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,168 line:-1
Just pretend.


263
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,537 line:-1
Also, the data goes up
to 12 cups of coffee,


264
00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:39.239 line:-1 position:50%
But don't worry,
no engineers were harmed


265
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,208 line:-1
in the making of this data;
it's all made up.


266
00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:44.410 line:-1 position:50%
All right, let's see how we can
make this data navigable


267
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,212 line:-1
for VoiceOver users.


268
00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.615 line:-1 position:50%
Here's an example snippet of
code from a chart view class


269
00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:51.818 line:-1 position:50%
and its corresponding
model object.


270
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,820 line:-1
The chart view might have
a reference to its model,


271
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,023 line:-1
and a function
for drawing itself.


272
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,225 line:-1
And the model might have the
chart's title and data points


273
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,594 line:-1
contained in a simple struct.


274
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,795 line:-1
The first thing
you'll want to do


275
00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.864 line:-1 position:50%
is make the chart a container.


276
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,534 line:-1
This will help VoiceOver group
your chart elements correctly


277
00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:09.736 line:-1 position:50%
and aid in navigation.


278
00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:11.070 line:-1 position:50%
To make your chart a container,


279
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.172 line:-1 position:50%
simply override
accessibilityContainerType


280
00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:15.608 line:-1 position:50%
on your ChartView


281
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,545 line:-1
and return the semanticGroup
container type.


282
00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:20.647 line:-1 position:50%
Again, this is important
for VoiceOver navigation


283
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:24,517 line:-1
and communicating which elements
belong to the chart.


284
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:28.755 line:-1 position:50%
Next, we need to give our chart
an accessibilityLabel.


285
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,356 line:-1
This tells VoiceOver
what to speak


286
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,392 line:-1
when it encounters your chart.


287
00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:34.294 line:-1 position:50%
Typically, this should
just be your chart's title


288
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,462 line:-1
or something similar
that VoiceOver can speak


289
00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:39.966 line:-1 position:50%
to uniquely identify
your chart in your UI.


290
00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:42.101 line:-1 position:50%
Last but not least,
you'll want to provide


291
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,871 line:-1
an accessibility element
for each data point.


292
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.339 line:-1 position:50%
You can provide these elements


293
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,842 line:-1
by overriding your chart view's
accessibilityElements property.


294
00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.544 line:-1 position:50%
This will create elements
inside your chart


295
00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.046 line:-1 position:50%
that VoiceOver can navigate,


296
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,514 line:-1
so that people
can get information


297
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,483 line:-1
about individual data points.


298
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,019 line:-1
To implement this,
you can simply use "map"


299
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,888 line:-1
to build an array
of accessibility elements


300
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,158 line:-1
from your list of data points.


301
00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:06.392 line:-1 position:50%
For each data point,


302
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,028 line:-1
we'll create a new
UIAccessibilityElement object,


303
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:13,333 line:-1
specifying the ChartView
as its accessibilityContainer.


304
00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:16.502 line:-1 position:50%
Then, we'll provide a string
representation of the data point


305
00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:19.138 line:-1 position:50%
for the element's
accessibilityValue property.


306
00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:21.307 line:-1 position:50%
This string is
what VoiceOver will speak


307
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,277 line:-1
when it navigates
to these data point elements.


308
00:12:24.277 --> 00:12:25.345 line:-1 position:50%
In your code,


309
00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:26.946 line:-1 position:50%
you'll probably want
this string to be localized,


310
00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:28.681 line:-1 position:50%
and you may want to use
a strings dictionary


311
00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:30.683 line:-1 position:50%
to define proper
pluralization rules.


312
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,086 line:-1
For this example, though,
let's just keep it simple.


313
00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.488 line:-1 position:50%
Lastly, we need to provide
an accessibility frame


314
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,924 line:-1
for our element so that
VoiceOver knows where it lives


315
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,627 line:-1
on the screen.


316
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,096 position:50%
You'll probably already have
logic for computing the frame


317
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,731 line:0
for each data point elsewhere,


318
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,933 position:50%
since you needed this
to draw the visual chart.


319
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:51,671 line:0
If you have it available,
you can reuse that logic here.


320
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,906 line:0
You can now return your finished
accessibility element


321
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,375 position:50%
for this data point.


322
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,411 line:-1
All right! Let's see what
we've accomplished so far.


323
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,780 line:-1
VoiceOver: Cups of coffee
versus lines of code.


324
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,783 line:0
Zero cups.
Twenty lines of code.


325
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,319 position:50%
One cup.
Thirty lines of code.


326
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,522 position:50%
Two cups.
Thirty-five lines of code.


327
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:13,226 position:50%
Three cups.
Thirty-two lines of code.


328
00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.227 line:-1 position:50%
Preston: Great!


329
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,195 line:-1
As you heard,
VoiceOver now speaks the title


330
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,297 line:-1
when it focuses an element
inside the chart


331
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,999 line:-1
because we made the chart
a semantic group


332
00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:22.168 line:-1 position:50%
and gave it
an accessibility label.


333
00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:24.671 line:-1 position:50%
We also made it possible to
navigate through each data point


334
00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:27.106 line:-1 position:50%
by creating
a UIAccessibilityElement


335
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,443 line:-1
to represent each one.


336
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,146 line:-1
There's one more thing I want
to mention before we move on.


337
00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.447 line:-1 position:50%
Sometimes you might
have hundreds


338
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,582 line:-1
or even thousands
of data points.


339
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,451 line:-1
In these cases, you definitely
don't want to make


340
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,653 line:-1
an accessibility element
for each data point


341
00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.256 line:-1 position:50%
because there will just be
way too many to navigate.


342
00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:45.324 line:-1 position:50%
Instead, we suggest
breaking up your chart


343
00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:48.261 line:-1 position:50%
into reasonable intervals and
making an accessibility element


344
00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:51.030 line:-1 position:50%
for each interval
rather than each data point.


345
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.999 line:-1 position:50%
This will provide
a better navigation experience


346
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,467 line:-1
as well as improve performance


347
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,703 line:-1
while still being
understandable.


348
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,238 line:-1
We're not done yet;
we can do even more.


349
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,607 line:-1
Making data navigable
is important,


350
00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:04.644 line:-1 position:50%
but we're still only presenting
raw data to VoiceOver users


351
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,713 line:-1
one point at a time.


352
00:14:06.713 --> 00:14:08.881 line:-1 position:50%
The value of charts
is their ability to show us


353
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,817 line:-1
what the data
is really telling us,


354
00:14:10.817 --> 00:14:13.653 line:-1 position:50%
and to help us look beyond
individual data points.


355
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,422 line:-1
This is where audio graphs
come in.


356
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,558 line:-1
So now -- finally --
let's talk about


357
00:14:18.558 --> 00:14:21.127 line:-1 position:50%
how to implement audio graph
support for your chart.


358
00:14:21.127 --> 00:14:22.862 line:-1 position:50%
Imagine we have
a ChartModel struct


359
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,864 line:-1
that contains all the
information we need


360
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.966 line:-1 position:50%
to define a particular chart.


361
00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:29.035 line:-1 position:50%
In your code,
you probably have a model object


362
00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.471 line:-1 position:50%
that looks something
like this already.


363
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,939 line:-1
If you don't, don't worry.


364
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,607 line:-1
These concepts will
still apply to your code


365
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,609 line:-1
however it's organized.


366
00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:41.547 line:-1 position:50%
For our example, let's say a
chart has a title and a summary,


367
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,183 line:-1
it has an X and a Y axis,


368
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,853 line:-1
and each axis has a title
as well as a numeric range


369
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,822 line:-1
representing the minimum
and maximum displayable values


370
00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:52.291 line:-1 position:50%
for the axis.


371
00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:54.293 line:-1 position:50%
And lastly, it has
an array of data points


372
00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:58.030 line:-1 position:50%
containing our chart's
actual data.


373
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,333 line:-1
We'll use the information
in this example model object


374
00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:04.771 line:-1 position:50%
to enable the audio graph
feature for our chart.


375
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,273 line:-1
First, import
the Accessibility framework,


376
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,708 line:-1
then extend your ChartView class


377
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,745 line:-1
to conform to the AXChart
protocol.


378
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,047 line:-1
Conforming to the AXChart
protocol is easy


379
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,283 line:-1
because there's only
one property to support.


380
00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:20.019 line:-1 position:50%
You just need to implement
accessibilityChartDescriptor.


381
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,754 line:-1
The chart descriptor
object you construct


382
00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.856 line:-1 position:50%
will contain all of
the information VoiceOver needs


383
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,392 line:-1
to provide
the audio graph experience.


384
00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:28.661 line:-1 position:50%
Let's walk through how to build
one of these chart descriptors


385
00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:30.096 line:-1 position:50%
step by step.


386
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:34,400 line:-1
First, we need to create an axis
descriptor object for each axis.


387
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.303 line:-1 position:50%
Each axis descriptor provides
information to VoiceOver


388
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,373 line:-1
about whether it represents
categorical or numerical data,


389
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,542 line:-1
the range of displayable
values for the axis,


390
00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:44.043 line:-1 position:50%
the positions of grid lines,


391
00:15:44.043 --> 00:15:46.979 line:-1 position:50%
and how to format
speakable data values.


392
00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.348 line:-1 position:50%
Since the X axis is numeric
for our coffee chart,


393
00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:52.084 line:-1 position:50%
we'll create a numeric
axis descriptor.


394
00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:54.220 line:-1 position:50%
If we had categorical data
on our X axis,


395
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.024 line:-1 position:50%
we'd use a categorical
axis descriptor instead.


396
00:15:58.024 --> 00:15:59.992 line:-1 position:50%
We'll provide the title
and range for this axis


397
00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:02.061 line:-1 position:50%
using our model object.


398
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:03.429 line:-1 position:50%
We can also optionally provide


399
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,098 line:-1
the positions of grid lines
on this axis if we have them.


400
00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.099 line:-1 position:50%
When you provide grid lines,


401
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,435 line:-1
they're represented in the
audio graph as haptic feedback


402
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,871 line:-1
during playback and interaction.


403
00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:13.339 line:-1 position:50%
We'll leave this empty for now


404
00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:18.244 line:-1 position:50%
since we don't have any X-axis
grid lines in this chart.


405
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,813 line:-1
For numeric axes,
we also need to create


406
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:23.149 line:-1 position:50%
a valueDescriptionProvider
closure.


407
00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.551 line:-1 position:50%
This closure is very important
because it tells VoiceOver


408
00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:27.420 line:-1 position:50%
how to speak
the values on this axis,


409
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,924 line:-1
so it can say "5 cups"
instead of just saying "5".


410
00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:34.827 line:-1 position:50%
For this axis, we'll format
the description to speak "cups"


411
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,529 line:-1
after the value.


412
00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:37.663 line:-1 position:50%
Again, in your code,


413
00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:39.398 line:-1 position:50%
you would probably want
to localize this string


414
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,033 line:-1
with proper pluralization rules,


415
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,936 line:-1
but let's keep this example
simple.


416
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,805 line:-1
We'll do the same thing
to create an axis descriptor


417
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,875 line:-1
for our Y axis, except we'll
format our value description


418
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,879 line:-1
to say "lines of code"
rather than "cups."


419
00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:55.248 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we have the basic
structure of our chart defined,


420
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,150 line:-1
let's add the data.


421
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.720 line:-1 position:50%
To do this, you add
a data series descriptor


422
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,655 line:-1
for each data series.


423
00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:04.891 line:-1 position:50%
We only have one data series
in this chart,


424
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,126 line:-1
so we'll just create
one data series descriptor,


425
00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:08.928 line:-1 position:50%
passing in the name
of the series,


426
00:17:08.928 --> 00:17:10.563 line:-1 position:50%
whether or not it is continuous,


427
00:17:10.563 --> 00:17:13.933 line:-1 position:50%
and the actual data points
for this series.


428
00:17:13.933 --> 00:17:15.768 line:-1 position:50%
You should pass "false"
for "isContinuous"


429
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,503 line:-1
when the series
is visually represented


430
00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:19.605 line:-1 position:50%
using discrete marks,
like points or bars,


431
00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:20.706 line:-1 position:50%
and you should pass "true"


432
00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:24.543 line:-1 position:50%
when the series is visually
represented as a line.


433
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,811 line:-1
For the series' data,


434
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,415 line:-1
we need to provide an array
of AXDataPoint objects.


435
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,484 line:-1
The easiest way to do this
is to just map them


436
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,386 line:-1
from the data
in the chart model.


437
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,620 line:-1
We're almost there!


438
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,489 line:-1
We just have one last
thing to do.


439
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,024 line:-1
And that's to put
all the pieces together


440
00:17:38.024 --> 00:17:41.560 line:-1 position:50%
to build our
AXChartDescriptor object.


441
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.728 line:-1 position:50%
We'll give it a title,


442
00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:45.998 line:-1 position:50%
which should, again,
be the title of our chart.


443
00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:49.268 line:-1 position:50%
Then, if we have one, we can
provide a summary of our chart.


444
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,038 line:-1
This is kind of like providing
alt text for your chart.


445
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,639 line:-1
You should use this property
to communicate


446
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,441 line:-1
the most important insights
from your data


447
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,376 line:-1
in a sentence or two.


448
00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.245 line:-1 position:50%
This summary text
will be presented to users


449
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,447 line:-1
in the audio graph
explorer view.


450
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,683 line:-1
This can be incredibly helpful
to VoiceOver users


451
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,618 line:-1
trying to understand your chart.


452
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:08,254 line:-1
Lastly, we'll provide the axis
and data series descriptors


453
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,756 line:-1
we created earlier to complete
our chart descriptor


454
00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:11.958 line:-1 position:50%
and then we'll return it.


455
00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.193 line:-1 position:50%
That's it!
Let's see the final result.

Preston: Let's recap.


463
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,359 line:-1
Be sure to make
accessible choices


464
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,694 line:-1
for the visual design
of your chart.


465
00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:51.330 line:-1 position:50%
This includes using
good contrast ratios,


466
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,999 line:-1
using symbols
in addition to color


467
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,001 line:-1
to differentiate
categories of data,


468
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,336 line:-1
and avoiding color schemes
