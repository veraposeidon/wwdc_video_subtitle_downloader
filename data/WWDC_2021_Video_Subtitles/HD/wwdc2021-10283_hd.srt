[Ari] Hi, I'm Ari, and today,
along with Cameron,


5
00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.715 line:-2 align:start position:29%
I'm excited to introduce you
to the world of Shortcuts


6
00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:18.619 line:-2 align:center
and talk about how you can design actions
that power great experiences


7
00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:21.355 line:-1 align:center
in Shortcuts, Siri, and Suggestions.


8
00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.490 line:-1 align:center
When we think about designing apps,


9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,193 line:-1
we usually focus on the details of the UI


10
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,963 position:23% line:-2
and what the user can see and feel
when they're inside of your app.


11
00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:33.166 line:-2 align:start position:25%
But in this talk, we're going to do
something a little different.


12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.969 line:-2 position:22% align:start
We're going to focus on experiences
that people can have


13
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,672 line:-2 align:start
with your app
when your app isn't even open.


14
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,641 position:33% line:-2
We think that there's
a world of opportunity


15
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,609 line:-1
that we can open up by thinking this way.


16
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:46,246 position:30% line:-2
It all starts with a concept
we call "actions."


17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,249 line:-1
An action is a way of representing a task


18
00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:51.451 line:-1 align:center
that people can complete with your app.


19
00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:53.787 line:-1 align:center
By creating actions, you can let people


20
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.324 line:-2 align:start position:30%
perform those tasks
in new and exciting ways.


21
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,626 line:-1
Let's say you make the Calendar app.


22
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,029 line:-2 align:start
What are some of the most
common things people do


23
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,931 line:-1
when they're inside of the Calendar app?


24
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:07,634 line:-2 align:start
Well, people probably add new events,
look up existing events,


25
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,269 line:-1
and make changes to events.


26
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:12,706 line:-1
Those are all great ideas for actions.


27
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,375 line:-1
So, the Calendar app can define an action


28
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,044 line:-1
for each one of those activities.


29
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,680 line:-1
This is where the magic begins.


30
00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.316 line:-2 position:32% align:start
Once the Calendar app
creates these actions,


31
00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:25.452 line:-2 position:22% align:start
people can use them
as building blocks to form shortcuts.


32
00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:28.755 line:-2 align:center
For example,
this Add New Event action is great


33
00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.124 line:-1 align:start position:19%
for quickly adding events to my calendar.


34
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,261 line:-2 align:start
People can customize actions,
like by setting this one


35
00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:37.664 line:-2 align:start position:27%
to create events called "Yoga"
from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.


36
00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:40.100 line:-1 align:center
The action can then become a shortcut,


37
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.002 line:-1 align:center
which people can use to perform the action


38
00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:44.171 line:-1 align:center
whenever they want, in a single tap.


39
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,174 align:start line:-2
People can also mix
and match different actions together


40
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,344 align:start line:-2
to form a shortcut that does
something even more powerful,


41
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,880 position:23% line:-2
like finding all your Calendar events
for today


42
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,116 line:-2 align:start
and adding a personal
meeting room URL to each one.


43
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,853 position:25% line:-2
That can form
another super valuable shortcut.


44
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:03,724 align:start line:-2
And people can use actions
from different apps together


45
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,093 line:-2 align:start
to get even more done
in a single shortcut,


46
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.662 line:-2 align:start position:32%
like this one that gets
my next Calendar event


47
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,698 line:-2 align:start
and sends a message to the attendees
saying I'll be running late.


48
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,870 line:-2 align:start
And these examples are just scratching
the surface of what people can do.


49
00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:19.473 line:-1 align:center
By creating only just a few actions,


50
00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.508 line:-1 align:center
the Calendar app has opened itself up


51
00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:23.210 line:-1 align:center
to thousands of new use cases


52
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,313 position:26% line:-2
that can be used with Shortcuts
across Apple devices.


53
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,150 position:25% line:-2
With the updated Shortcut editor,
anyone can build Shortcuts


54
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:33,287 line:-1
by dragging and dropping actions together.


55
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.089 line:-2 align:start position:25%
Creating actions can help people
who use your app,


56
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,292 line:-1
even if they don't set up any shortcuts.


57
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:40.894 line:-1 align:center
If you donate actions to the system,


58
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,497 line:-2 align:start
Siri will automatically learn
how people use your app


59
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,200 position:28% line:-2
and will suggest your actions
at the right time,


60
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:50,003 align:start line:-2
in the Suggestions widget,
in Search, and on the Lock screen.


61
00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:52.306 line:-1 align:center
And people can use any shortcut


62
00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.541 line:-1 align:center
just by saying its name to Siri.


63
00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:57.344 line:-2 align:start position:36%
"Hey Siri,
Order Starbucks."


64
00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.547 line:-2 position:30% align:start
Just like that,
Siri will kick off the action


65
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,516 line:-1
and can ask follow-up questions


66
00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.752 line:-2 position:24% align:start
to get the information
your app needs to take an action.


67
00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:09.089 line:-2 align:start position:29%
So, by creating actions,
you're automatically making


68
00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.924 line:-1 align:center
your app's functionality voice-enabled,


69
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,493 line:-1
so people can use it from anywhere.


70
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,796 line:-1
That extends beyond Siri, too.


71
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,032 line:-2 align:start
Shortcuts can be run from
across iOS and macOS,


72
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,135 position:18% line:-2
like with a single tap from
the Shortcuts widget on the Home screen


73
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,505 line:-1
or from the menu bar on the Mac.


74
00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:26.573 line:-1 align:center
By exposing actions from your app,


75
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:30,244 line:-2 position:25%
you open your app up to a world
of Shortcuts possibilities.


76
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,047 line:-1
Exposing a great action can delight users


77
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:37,351 position:20% line:-2
by saving them time and enabling them
to build new things.


78
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,287 line:-2 align:start
So, in this session,
we're going to try to answer the question,


79
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,022 line:-1
"What makes an action great?"


80
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,959 line:-2 position:19%
And to walk through that, we've broken it
down into a few principles.


81
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:49,530 line:-1
Great actions are useful, modular,


82
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,100 line:-1
multi-modal, clear, and discoverable.


83
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,636 line:-1
So let's dive in.


84
00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.639 line:-2 position:28% align:start
It sounds obvious
that great actions are useful,


85
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,808 line:-2 align:start
but what does it really mean
to design something that's useful?


86
00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:05.445 line:-2 align:start position:29%
In the context of Shortcuts,
a useful action is one


87
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,216 position:22% line:-2
that performs a task that people
would normally do inside of your app.


88
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.885 line:-2 align:start position:29%
Your action should perform
the task completely,


89
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,955 line:-2 align:start
and you should avoid opening your app
into the foreground,


90
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,624 line:-1
unless it's necessary for your use case.


91
00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:20.627 line:-2 align:start position:23%
Where possible,
you should ask follow-up questions


92
00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:22.663 line:-1 align:center
instead of opening the app.


93
00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.865 line:-1 align:center
Let's look at the Reminders app.


94
00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:27.434 line:-2 align:start position:29%
One of the primary features
in the Reminders app


95
00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.037 line:-1 align:center
is the ability to add a new reminder.


96
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,505 line:-1
When you edit a reminder,


97
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,241 line:-2 align:start
you can configure
a variety of its attributes.


98
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,411 line:-2 align:start
Adding a reminder is something you
can do inside of the Reminders app,


99
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,747 line:-2 position:26%
but it would also be useful to be
able to do it outside of the app,


100
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,817 line:-2 position:31%
so this will make
a great Shortcuts action.


101
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:47,087 line:-2 align:start
Here's what the action
would look like in Shortcuts.


102
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.324 line:-2 align:start position:22%
Note that the options you can choose
when setting up a reminder


103
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,160 line:-1
are configurable as parameters here.


104
00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:55.596 line:-2 align:start position:32%
When I use a shortcut
to add a new reminder,


105
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.397 line:-1 align:center
it should add immediately,


106
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:00.567 line:-1 align:center
without opening the Reminders app.


107
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:03.170 line:-2 align:start position:30%
But let's say I'm designing
a different action,


108
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,273 align:start line:-2
one that shows a particular list
inside the Reminders app.


109
00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.809 line:-1 align:center
In this case, opening the app is necessary


110
00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:10.544 line:-1 align:center
to fulfill the goal of the action,


111
00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:13.180 line:-1 align:center
so it's okay to make an action for this.


112
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,783 align:start line:-2
But the action for adding new reminders
is a bit more valuable than this one


113
00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:20.254 line:-2 position:19% align:start
because people can use it without being
pulled away from their current context.


114
00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.757 line:-2 position:29% align:start
One more thing to consider
is what to do


115
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.760 line:-2 align:start position:22%
if your action needs more information
from the user to complete,


116
00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.263 line:-2 align:start position:28%
like if someone uses
an Add New Reminder action


117
00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:31.832 line:-1 align:center
that doesn't have a title specified.


118
00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:34.234 line:-1 align:center
In this case, when the shortcut is run,


119
00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:36.170 line:-1 align:center
the action can ask a follow-up question,


120
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,639 line:-2 align:start
like, "What do you wanna be
reminded about?"


121
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.041 line:-1 align:center
When possible, you should handle ambiguity


122
00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:42.676 line:-1 align:center
by asking a follow-up question,


123
00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:45.679 line:-2 align:start position:26%
instead of by opening your app,
which should be a last resort.


124
00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.881 line:-1 align:center
A related topic to consider


125
00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:51.351 line:-2 position:28% align:start
when deciding which actions
will be useful is immersion.


126
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,587 line:-1
Your action should perform a task


127
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,191 line:-2 align:start
without immersing people
in a complex experience.


128
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,527 line:-2 align:start
Let's say I'm designing actions
for the Apple Watch app.


129
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,863 line:-1
A great feature of this app is the ability


130
00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:05.432 line:-1 align:center
to create and customize Watch faces.


131
00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:08.101 line:-2 position:30% align:start
This is a very complicated
and visual task


132
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,337 line:-1
with tons of custom UI controls


133
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,239 line:-1
and live visual previews.


134
00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:14.842 line:-2 position:25% align:start
Ultimately,
it's a very immersive experience,


135
00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:18.512 line:-2 align:start position:25%
and so it's probably not going
to make a great Shortcuts action.


136
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,216 position:23% line:-2
On the other hand, a simple task,
like switching between Watch faces


137
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,885 align:start line:-2
that are already set up,
is not too immersive,


138
00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:28.355 line:-2 position:23% align:start
and it's something that can be used
without your full attention.


139
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.724 line:-2 position:35% align:start
So this functionality
will be really useful


140
00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:32.492 line:-1 align:center
as a Shortcuts action.


141
00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:34.494 line:-1 align:center
With this action, I can make a shortcut


142
00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:37.064 line:-2 align:start position:23%
that lets me change my Watch face
in one tap,


143
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,132 line:-1
or I could make an Automation


144
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,902 line:-2 align:start
that changes it automatically
throughout the day.


145
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:45,105 line:-2 position:27%
Lastly, the most useful actions
are usually the ones


146
00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:47.007 line:-1 align:center
that are the most repeatable.


147
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,309 align:start line:-2
When you're deciding
which actions to build,


148
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,346 line:-2 position:27%
prioritize those that are useful
on a recurring basis


149
00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:55.349 line:-2 position:33% align:start
and that can be used
quickly and frequently.


150
00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:57.484 line:-1 align:center
For example, the Apple Music app


151
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,753 line:-1
has the ability to follow friends.


152
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,656 line:-2 align:start
It would be cool to expose this
as a Shortcuts action.


153
00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.491 line:-2 position:32% align:start
People could use it
in a multi-step shortcut,


154
00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:07.127 line:-2 position:27% align:start
for example,
to follow many friends at once.


155
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.964 line:-2 position:23% align:start
But if you compare following friends
to other features of the Music app,


156
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,901 line:-2 align:start
like actually playing music,
it's clear that following friends


157
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,203 position:29% line:-2
is something that people do
much less often.


158
00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:19.339 line:-2 position:20% align:start
If time permits,
it's always better to build more actions,


159
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,809 line:-2 position:23%
so you could consider making both,
but you should always prioritize


160
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,679 line:-2 position:26%
building actions for the features
that people will use the most.


161
00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:29.183 line:-2 align:start position:31%
So a useful action is one
that performs a task,


162
00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:32.319 line:-2 align:start position:24%
ideally without launching your app,
is not too immersive,


163
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:36,156 align:start line:-2
and is repeatable, in that people
will use it quickly and frequently.


164
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,126 line:-2 position:27%
To tell you a whole lot more
about designing great actions,


165
00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:41.828 line:-1 align:center
I'm going to turn it over to Cameron.


166
00:07:41.862 --> 00:07:42.863 line:-1 align:center
[Cameron] Thanks, Ari!


167
00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:45.966 line:-2 position:19% align:start
My name is Cameron, and I'm a designer
on the Siri and Shortcuts teams.


168
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,001 line:-2 align:start
Today, I'm really excited
to take you through


169
00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:50.170 line:-2 position:30% align:start
the finer points
of designing great actions.


170
00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:51.939 line:-1 align:center
First, let's start by talking


171
00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:54.708 line:-2 position:29% align:start
about how to design actions
that are modular.


172
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:56.310 line:-1 align:center
For the sake of example,


173
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,478 position:31% line:-2
imagine there are
two separate To Do apps


174
00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:01.515 line:-2 align:start position:22%
that are both thinking
about creating actions for shortcuts.


175
00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:04.451 line:-1 align:center
They're called "Dog Do's" and "Shortcats."


176
00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.187 line:-2 align:start position:26%
They both have the same goal:
to create a shortcut


177
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,123 line:-2 position:30%
that enables people
to clean up their old tasks.


178
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,192 line:-1
Dog Do's has the idea to create


179
00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:14.595 line:-1 align:center
an action called "Clean up old tasks,"


180
00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:16.163 line:-1 align:center
which seems reasonable.


181
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,599 line:-1
After all, it does everything, all in one.


182
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:21,068 line:-2 align:start
But really, the Cat app
has the right idea.


183
00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:24.738 line:-2 align:start position:24%
They've created a suite of actions
that each individually do one thing


184
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,673 line:-1
and together can do so much more.


185
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,943 position:23% line:-2
Let's take a look at how that works
for our cleanup shortcut.


186
00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:32.813 line:-1 align:center
Here we can see Dog Do's and Shortcats


187
00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.415 line:-2 position:30% align:start
can both fulfill the goal
of "Cleaning up old tasks."


188
00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:37.751 line:-1 align:center
But they do so in a very different way.


189
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:41,288 align:start line:-2
Dog Do's has a single action,
whereas the Cat app combines


190
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:45,192 position:23% line:-2
the Get Task action with an Archive
action to accomplish the goal.


191
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,529 align:start line:-2
The first action,
"Get tasks created before a week ago,"


192
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:51,565 position:23% line:-2
finds old tasks,
and the second one archives them.


193
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,001 align:start line:-2
On the other hand,
looking at the Dog Do's' action,


194
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,770 line:-2 align:start
it's unclear what exactly
this action will do


195
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,606 line:-1
because the summary isn't specific.


196
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.409 line:-2 align:start position:20%
So what will happen
when someone runs the Cats' shortcut?


197
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:05,412 line:-2 align:start
For example, with Siri,
Siri will ask the user to confirm


198
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,614 line:-2 align:start
whether or not they want
to archive the tasks,


199
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,951 align:start line:-2
along with showing a preview
of which tasks will be archived.


200
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:14,655 line:-2 align:start
This example is using the Get
and Archive actions working together.


201
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,724 position:21% line:-2
But because the actions are modular,
they can also be useful


202
00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:20.894 line:-1 position:17% align:start
in other combinations, or even standalone.


203
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,363 line:-1
Here, you can see that Archive action


204
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,165 line:-1
is quite useful by itself.


205
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,167 line:-1
When it's used without a Get action,


206
00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:30.838 line:-2 align:start position:32%
it should ask which task
they want to archive.


207
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:34.575 line:-2 position:19% align:start
The Get action is also useful on its own,
like in this case,


208
00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:37.211 line:-2 align:start position:30%
where it's used to show all
of the tasks I created


209
00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:39.513 line:-1 align:center
before one week ago.


210
00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:42.249 line:-2 align:start position:30%
Already, you can see
that the Shortcats' actions


211
00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:44.718 line:-2 align:start position:30%
are much more extensible
than the Dog Do's action,


212
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.488 line:-1 align:center
which can't be reused for other purposes.


213
00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:51.625 line:-2 align:start position:24%
In the context of Siri suggestions,
the Dog Do's action is vague;


214
00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:54.561 line:-2 align:start position:24%
it's difficult to tell what it would do
if it was tapped on.


215
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:58,098 line:-2 align:start
On the other hand, Shortcats has
donated the Get Tasks action,


216
00:09:58.131 --> 00:10:01.535 line:-2 align:start position:24%
which includes a parameter:
the period of time to get tasks for.


217
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:05,339 position:18% line:-2
This makes it super clear what will happen
if someone taps on the suggestion.


218
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,708 line:-2 align:start
Including parameters makes
for a more approachable


219
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:09.877 line:-1 align:center
and better user experience.


220
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,946 line:-2 position:23%
In the context of the shortcut editor,
again,


221
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,849 line:-2 align:start
we can see the Dog Do's action
is vague and inflexible,


222
00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:19.253 line:-2 position:17% align:start
whereas the Shortcats actions' parameters
can easily be customized


223
00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.154 line:-1 align:center
to change the window of task retrieval


224
00:10:21.188 --> 00:10:24.057 line:-1 align:center
from one to two weeks.


225
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,894 line:-2 position:31%
But the story isn't just
about your app's actions;


226
00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:30.063 line:-2 align:start position:29%
it's also about actions
that are built in to Shortcuts


227
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,965 line:-1
and actions from other apps.


228
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,968 align:start line:-2
By combining all of these types
of actions together,


229
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:37,704 line:-1
people can create entirely new Shortcuts


230
00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:39.673 line:-1 align:center
and use cases with your app.


231
00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:42.776 line:-2 align:start position:29%
You might be wondering
how actions work together.


232
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,312 position:30% line:-2
You can see how it works
in the Shortcut editor.


233
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,915 line:-2 position:30%
Each action has an output,
which can be passed


234
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,517 position:23% line:-2
into the parameter of another action
using a variable.


235
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:53,487 align:start line:-2
Here, the Archive Task action
is using a variable


236
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,123 line:-1
called "Cat Tasks" to archive the tasks


237
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,092 line:-2 align:start
that meet the criteria specified
in the first action.


238
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:02,829 position:24% line:-2
But the Cat app has gone further
and exposed additional properties


239
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,232 line:-1
as output from the Get Tasks action,


240
00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:07.301 line:-1 align:center
like Reminder, Attachment,


241
00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.603 line:-1 align:center
Parent task, Deadline, Notes,


242
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,005 line:-1
and the list the Task is in.


243
00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:14.274 line:-1 align:center
When people attach other actions,


244
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:17,377 position:19% line:-2
they can employ these output properties
to create new functionality.


245
00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:20.480 line:-2 position:25% align:start
For example, the built-in
Show Result action can be used


246
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,950 line:-2 position:30%
with the Get Tasks action
to show all of the notes


247
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,818 line:-1
from all of my old tasks.


248
00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:28.355 line:-2 position:22% align:start
Or the same action can be combined
with a Save File action


249
00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:31.959 line:-2 position:27% align:start
to save all of the attachments
from my old tasks to iCloud.


250
00:11:33.427 --> 00:11:37.064 line:-2 position:26% align:start
When you separate your output
into pieces and label them,


251
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,367 align:start line:-2
they show up when you're editing
a variable in the Shortcut editor.


252
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,370 align:start line:-2
This gives Shortcuts authors
a powerful tool they can use


253
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:47,341 line:-2 position:20%
to create new use cases that go beyond
what's possible, even in your app.


254
00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:50.611 line:-2 position:25% align:start
When creating actions
for concepts specific to your app,


255
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:54,114 line:-2 align:start
like tasks in the Shortcats app,
or files in the Files app,


256
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:57,117 line:-2 position:23%
here are some common actions
that you should consider designing.


257
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,418 line:-1
Create actions.


258
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:02,022 position:19% line:-2
They add a new thing,
given some parameters, like a new task.


259
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.557 line:-1 align:center
The new thing is passed as output.


260
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,659 line:-2 align:start
This action should also include
a custom interface


261
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,195 line:-1
and dialogue summarizing what was added.


262
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,031 align:start line:-2
Edit actions.
They change a thing in your app.


263
00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.567 line:-1 align:center
The new item should be passed as output.


264
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.803 line:-1 align:center
Delete actions cause the specified thing


265
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,405 line:-1
to be deleted in your app.


266
00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:19.773 line:-1 align:center
Get actions.


267
00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:22.876 line:-2 position:29% align:start
They find things in your app
that match certain criteria.


268
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,312 position:32% line:-2
Everything that is found
is passed as output.


269
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,148 align:start line:-2
Get actions should also include
a custom interface


270
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,551 line:-2 align:start
and dialogue that summarizes
what was found.


271
00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:31.852 line:-1 align:center
Thing actions.


272
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:35,189 line:-2 position:21%
They let someone pick a specific thing
from your app, for example,


273
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,024 line:-1
a task in the Shortcats app.


274
00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:40.427 line:-2 position:22% align:start
This action should both include
a custom interface showing the thing


275
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.931 line:-2 align:start position:28%
and pass the thing as output,
for use with other actions.


276
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,166 line:-1
Lastly, open actions.


277
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,335 line:-2 position:23%
They cause your app to be opened
in the foreground,


278
00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:50.971 line:-1 align:center
with a specific thing in view.


279
00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:55.709 line:-2 align:start position:21%
Now, you know how and why to design
your actions to be modular.


280
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,178 line:-2 align:start
Remember, it's about
making things composable,


281
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,447 line:-2
while still making them
useful stand-alone,


282
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,649 line:-2 position:29%
making things customizable
with parameters,


283
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:06,420 line:-1
and offering outputs for all your actions.


284
00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:10.090 line:-2 position:27% align:start
Multimodality is about making
one piece of functionality,


285
00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:12.726 line:-1 align:center
your action, work in multiple ways


286
00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:15.462 line:-1 align:center
and across contexts and devices.


287
00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:17.831 line:-1 align:center
When you're designing Shortcuts actions,


288
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,901 line:-2 align:start
keep in mind that they can be used
in these three ways:


289
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,970 align:start line:-1
by running a shortcut in the UI,


290
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,938 line:-1 position:29%
either from a tap or a click;


291
00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:27.741 line:-2 position:21% align:start
by running a shortcut with your voice,
with Siri;


292
00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:31.445 line:-2 position:25% align:start
and when configuring your action
in the Shortcut Editor.


293
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,380 line:-1
Let's say you're adding a deadline


294
00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:35.616 line:-1 align:center
to one of your Cat tasks with a shortcut.


295
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,784 align:start line:-2
When you run the shortcut
by tapping on it,


296
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,753 line:-1
a UI will be shown to resolve the date,


297
00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:41.889 line:-1 align:center
using a calendar picker.


298
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,224 line:-2 position:31%
When this same shortcut
is run on the HomePod,


299
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,793 position:25% line:-2
Siri will ask someone a question
with a prompt,


300
00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:48.495 line:-1 align:center
like, "When is the deadline?"


301
00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:52.132 line:-2 position:24% align:start
And they might say something like
"Tomorrow" or "Next Tuesday."


302
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,269 line:-2 position:29%
Note how the same prompt
is used in the compact UI


303
00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:56.970 line:-1 align:center
when someone tapped to run a shortcut,


304
00:13:57.004 --> 00:14:00.374 line:-2 align:start position:27%
and on the HomePod
when they asked Siri to run it.


305
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:03,277 line:-2 position:22%
This works great because the prompt
is phrased as a question


306
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.013 line:-1 align:center
and is appropriate in both contexts.


307
00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:08.482 line:-1 align:center
The Dog Do's app, by contrast,


308
00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:11.051 line:-1 align:center
chose the dialogue "Deadline:,"


309
00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:13.887 line:-2 position:25% align:start
which looks fine
in the compact UI on the iPhone,


310
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:16,323 align:start line:-2
but doesn't make any sense
when spoken by Siri.


311
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,393 line:-2 align:start
You should always make sure
to phrase your prompts as questions


312
00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:21.028 line:-1 align:center
to avoid this problem.


313
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,498 position:21% line:-2
There's a whole lot more to designing
great dialogue for Siri to speak,


314
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,967 align:start line:-2
and I'd encourage you to check out
these talks from my colleagues


315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,036 line:-1
in years past on the topic.


316
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:31.939 line:-2 position:34% align:start
Finally, your action
also has an interface


317
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,373 line:-1
in the Shortcut editor,


318
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:35,642 align:start line:-2
where people can use it
as a building block.


319
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:39,313 line:-2 align:start
In the Shortcut editor,
the same parameters that Siri asks about


320
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,981 line:-1
are displayed as blue rectangles


321
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,817 line:-2 align:start
that the author can edit
when setting up the shortcut.


322
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:47,020 position:28% line:-2
For this date parameter,
a floating tip shows the date


323
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,289 line:-1
that is recognized from the entered text.


324
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,125 align:start line:-2
You should always aim to make
all parameters useable,


325
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,863 align:start line:-2
both when running a shortcut
and configuring it in the editor.


326
00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:58.065 line:-1 align:center
When choosing your action's parameters,


327
00:14:58.098 --> 00:15:00.267 line:-1 align:center
you'll need to pick a type for each one.


328
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,503 line:-1
The system includes many parameter types,


329
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:04,471 line:-1
which will work well across modalities.


330
00:15:04.505 --> 00:15:06.974 line:-1 align:center
That said, if your action needs to deal


331
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,109 line:-1
with a unique entity from your app


332
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,445 line:-2 align:start
that isn't well represented
by a system type,


333
00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:13.080 line:-1 align:center
you can define a custom one.


334
00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:15.816 line:-1 align:center
Let's take a look at an example.


335
00:15:15.849 --> 00:15:19.453 line:-2 align:start position:22%
The Set Playback Destination action,
built in to Shortcuts,


336
00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:21.421 line:-1 align:center
sets the audio route of your device,


337
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:24,157 align:start line:-2
like to your AirPods
or your Bluetooth speaker.


338
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:27,494 align:start line:-2
To help people understand
the devices they can choose from,


339
00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:30.297 line:-2 position:25% align:start
the Shortcut editor shows visuals
of those devices


340
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.499 line:-1 align:center
when someone clicks the parameter.


341
00:15:32.533 --> 00:15:35.936 line:-2 position:20% align:start
Because there isn't a built-in parameter
for representing devices,


342
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:39,806 line:-2 align:start
the action defines a custom parameter
and a UI to go along with it.


343
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.176 line:-1 align:center
We call these UIs "Dynamic Enumerations,"


344
00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:44.478 line:-1 align:center
and you can create them, too.


345
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:48,482 align:start line:-2
There are two different times when people
can pick values for parameters:


346
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,717 line:-1
configuration and resolution.


347
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:54.254 line:-2 position:19% align:start
Configuration is when someone is setting
up your action in the Shortcut editor.


348
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,490 line:-2 align:start
Resolution happens
when your action is run.


349
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:59,793 line:-2 position:25%
For example, on the left,
is a dynamic enumeration shown


350
00:15:59.826 --> 00:16:02.095 line:-1 align:center
when someone taps on the "Cat Task" field


351
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,331 line:-1
of the Archive Task action.


352
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:07,000 align:start line:-2
On the right is the visual list
that is shown


353
00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:10.304 line:-2 position:26% align:start
when Siri asks someone
what task they want to archive.


354
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:14,041 line:-2 align:start
Both of these UIs are filling
the same parameter in the Archive action,


355
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,778 align:start line:-2
the left one during configuration,
and the right one during resolution.


356
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,347 position:27% line:-2
And both should be populated
in similar ways,


357
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.884 line:-2 position:32% align:start
since they're both filling
the same parameter.


358
00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:25.752 line:-1 align:center
Now that you've learned how people


359
00:16:25.786 --> 00:16:27.988 line:-1 align:center
can fill in your action's parameters,


360
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,591 line:-2 position:32%
let's take a quick look
at the custom interfaces


361
00:16:30.624 --> 00:16:32.993 line:-2 position:29% align:start
that you can show to people
when they run your action.


362
00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:34.695 line:-1 align:center
We call these "snippets."


363
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:38,599 line:-2 align:start
For example, when we run
the Starbucks Order Coffee action,


364
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:42,202 align:start line:-2
a snippet is shown to preview
the order that will be placed.


365
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:45,272 align:start line:-2
For actions that are permanent,
like deletion or ordering,


366
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:48,075 align:start line:-2
you should strongly consider
showing a different snippet


367
00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:50.143 line:-1 align:center
before the action is completed as compared


368
00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:52.112 line:-2 position:32% align:start
to the one that is shown
after it's completed.


369
00:16:52.145 --> 00:16:55.015 line:-2 align:start position:24%
The snippet you show beforehand
should aid people


370
00:16:55.048 --> 00:16:57.317 line:-1 align:center
in understanding what the action will do.


371
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,687 line:-2 align:start
This is useful to help them understand
the stakes of going through with it.


372
00:17:00.721 --> 00:17:03.390 line:-2 align:start position:25%
There's a lot
to designing multimodal actions,


373
00:17:03.423 --> 00:17:05.592 line:-1 align:center
but by phrasing your prompts as questions,


374
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,427 line:-1
choosing appropriate parameters,


375
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:09.596 line:-1 align:center
creating visuals for filling parameters,


376
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,164 line:-1
and by designing great snippets,


377
00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:13.500 line:-1 align:center
you'll be well on your way.


378
00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:16.837 line:-2 align:start position:27%
Despite all this talk of actions,
we haven't actually discussed


379
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.173 line:-1 align:center
how actions are represented in the editor.


380
00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:21.508 line:-1 align:center
This section is all about that.


381
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,544 line:-1
In iOS 13,


382
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:26,079 line:-2 align:start
we introduced the concept
of a parameter summary,


383
00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:28.649 line:-2 position:34% align:start
a new visual format
that describes a task


384
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:30,851 line:-1
using natural language.


385
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,720 align:start line:-2
This year, we've redesigned
the appearance of actions


386
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:36,557 position:27% line:-2
in the Shortcut editor to focus
on the parameter summary.


387
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.760 line:-2 align:start position:26%
Notably, app names have been
removed from the action,


388
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,396 line:-2 align:start
and app icons
have been integrated in-line,


389
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,798 line:-1
along with the Show More control.


390
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,934 line:-1
We made these changes to make actions


391
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:49,136 line:-1
look even better in multi-step shortcuts


392
00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:51.405 line:-1 align:center
and to save space so even more actions


393
00:17:51.438 --> 00:17:53.574 line:-1 align:center
can fit on-screen at a time.


394
00:17:53.607 --> 00:17:57.244 line:-2 position:19% align:start
It's important when designing actions to
consider the experience people will have


395
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,546 line:-1
with your actions in the editor itself


396
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,082 line:-2 align:start
because Shortcuts exists
to give people the ability


397
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,818 line:-2 position:30%
to create new functionality
and share it with others.


398
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:07,020 line:-2 align:start
Remember that all Shortcuts
are open source,


399
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:09,590 line:-2 align:start
and anyone can look inside them
to see how they work.


400
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:12,759 align:start line:-2
Before we go into the details
of actions themselves,


401
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:16,396 position:19% line:-2
remember that your parameter summary
is different to your action title.


402
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.032 line:-2 align:start position:30%
Your action titles are used
in the Shortcuts action list


403
00:18:19.066 --> 00:18:21.168 line:-1 align:center
to briefly identify your action.


404
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,037 position:25% line:-2
It's important for your action title
to begin with the same verb


405
00:18:24,071 --> 00:18:27,875 position:21% line:-2
as your parameter summary,
and share as many words as possible,


406
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:29,977 line:-2 align:start
like here,
with the Send Message action.


407
00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.513 line:-1 align:center
Let's take a look at another example.


408
00:18:32.546 --> 00:18:34.214 line:-1 align:center
Here's a new app for helping me


409
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:37,551 align:start line:-2
with my morning breathing exercises
called Awebreath.


410
00:18:37.584 --> 00:18:39.820 line:-1 align:center
The app has a simple and focused UI


411
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,189 line:-2 position:27%
that lets you choose the length
you want to breathe for


412
00:18:42.222 --> 00:18:44.892 line:-1 align:center
and optionally play music.


413
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:48,195 align:start line:-2
When designing your action,
start with the parameter summary.


414
00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:51.598 line:-2 position:24% align:start
The summary succinctly describes
the action that will be performed,


415
00:18:51.632 --> 00:18:53.700 line:-1 align:center
including the most important parameters.


416
00:18:53.734 --> 00:18:55.969 line:-1 align:center
The summary should also begin with a verb


417
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:59,039 line:-2 position:21%
and should be written like a sentence,
but without the period.


418
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,909 align:start line:-2
Even though the Awebreath action
includes a parameter


419
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:04,978 align:start line:-2
for music to play while you breathe,
it's not required,


420
00:19:05.012 --> 00:19:06.747 line:-1 align:center
so it doesn't belong in your summary.


421
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.983 line:-2 position:28% align:start
Punctuation, like semicolons,
commas, and periods,


422
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:13,520 position:29% line:-2
should also never be
in your parameter summary.


423
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:16,990 align:start line:-2
People can still use this parameter,
the music to play,


424
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:18,492 line:-1
from your Options UI,


425
00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:21.795 line:-2 position:30% align:start
which can be expanded
by tapping on the chevron.


426
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,666 line:-2 align:start
If a required parameter is left empty,
when it's resolved,


427
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:28,769 line:-1
your action should ask for a value.


428
00:19:28.802 --> 00:19:30.804 line:-1 align:center
If you have a strong inclination


429
00:19:30.838 --> 00:19:32.906 line:-1 align:center
about the best experience for your action,


430
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,809 position:26% line:-2
consider providing
a default value for a parameter.


431
00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:38.078 line:-1 align:center
If you do this, your action may be able


432
00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:40.380 line:-1 align:center
to skip asking a question when it runs.


433
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:43,217 position:29% line:-2
In this example,
the Awebreath app provides


434
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,286 line:-1
a default breathing time of 15 minutes.


435
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.156 line:-2 position:28% align:start
Regardless of whether or not
a parameter is required


436
00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:50.524 line:-1 align:center
or has a default value,


437
00:19:50.557 --> 00:19:53.894 line:-2 align:start position:23%
people can always choose to make
any parameter into a question


438
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:57,831 position:28% line:-2
by using the special variable,
"Ask Each Time."


439
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,800 line:-1
When this is used, a shortcut will prompt


440
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,969 line:-1
for the parameter value when it's run.


441
00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:04.671 line:-2 align:start position:23%
For this reason,
you should always include a prompt


442
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,074 line:-1
and/or visual list, if applicable,


443
00:20:07.107 --> 00:20:09.843 line:-1 align:center
for all of your action's parameters.


444
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,280 position:18% line:-2
When designing your parameter summary,


445
00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:16.717 line:-2 align:start position:24%
make sure to summarize, starting with a verb,


446
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,386 align:start line:-2
consider providing default values,


447
00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:21.488 line:-1 align:center
remember that any parameter can be prompted for


448
00:20:21.522 --> 00:20:25.325 line:-2 align:start position:21%
if someone uses Ask Each Time, and place all your optional parameters
in the


449

options UI.


450
00:20:29.596 --> 00:20:32.032 line:-1 align:center
Last but not least, it's important to understand


451
00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:34.034 line:-1 align:center
how you can make your actions discoverable


452
00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:37.104 line:-1 align:center
and get them in front of people.


453
00:20:37.137 --> 00:20:39.673 line:-2 position:20% align:start
In iOS 15 and macOS Monterrey, we've


454
00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:42.342 line:-2 position:28% align:start
introduced new sharing methods
for Shortcuts


455
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:44,444 line:-1
that make it easy to share multi-step Shortcuts


456
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:47,948 align:start line:-2
that include your actions. The updated download UI


457
00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:49.550 line:-1 align:center
also displays where Shortcuts can be run,


458
00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:53.320 line:-2 align:start position:24%
so people know what to expect. As the creator of an app,


459
00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:56.957 line:-2 position:21% align:start
you can place links to multi-step Shortcuts that use your actions


460
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,561 line:-2 position:24%
on your website, social media channels, or in the help sections


461
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,863 line:-1
of your app to give people ideas on how to asked


462
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:06,200 align:start line:-2
use your actions together. Also new,


463
00:21:06.233 --> 00:21:08.168 line:-1 align:center
when someone taps "Add to Siri,"


464
00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:11.171 line:-1 align:center
the shortcut is added instantly, using


465
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:14,908 align:start line:-2
your suggested invocation phrase. This new UI emphasizes


466
00:21:14.942 --> 00:21:18.812 line:-2 align:start position:29%
your suggested invocation phrase, so people know what to


467
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:21,548 position:31% line:-2
say to Siri to run your shortcut. It also


468
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:23,717 line:-1
encourages them to audition your shortcut


469
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,820 position:26% line:-2
right after adding it. If you don't


470
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:30,591 line:-2 position:19%
provide a suggested invocation phrase, the shortcut won't be added


471
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:33,894 align:start line:-2
immediately after someone taps on "Add to Siri."  Instead, they will be


472
00:21:33.927 --> 00:21:35.996 line:-1 align:center
asked to provide their own shortcut name,


473
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,999 line:-2 position:27%
which isn't as seamless of an experience and


474
00:21:39.032 --> 00:21:40.367 line:-1 align:center
decreases the chances someone will successfully add and use your shortcut.


475
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,803 line:-2 position:30%
That's a wrap on changes
to sharing Shortcuts


476
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:44,838 line:-2 align:start
and getting your actions
in front of people.


477
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:47,708 line:-2 align:start
And with that,


478
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:50,444 line:-1
we've discussed how to design actions for


479
00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:53.080 line:-1 align:center
Shortcuts, Siri, and Suggestions.


480
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:56,450 line:-1
Great actions are useful, modular, multimodal,


481
00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:58.185 line:-1 align:center
clear, and discoverable.


482
00:21:58.218 --> 00:22:01.021 line:-2 position:22% align:start
Good luck designing actions.


483
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:02,456 line:-1
We can't wait to see what you build and


484
00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.157 line:-1 align:center
how it contributes to the world of Shortcuts. Have a great WWDC.
