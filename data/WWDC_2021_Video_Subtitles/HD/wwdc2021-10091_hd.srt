Kritarth Jain: Hi there
and welcome to


7
00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:15.782 line:-1 position:50%
"Send communication and
Time Sensitive notifications."


8
00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:19.553 line:-1 position:50%
I am Kritarth, an engineer
on the Notifications team,


9
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:23,924 line:-1
and later I will be joined
by my colleague, Kevin.


10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,326 line:-1
Notifications are
a key component


11
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,262 line:-1
of the application experience


12
00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:31.899 line:-1 position:50%
and we will cover new ways
to enhance them,


13
00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.670 line:-1 position:50%
along with elevating certain
categories of notifications.


14
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,705 line:-1
We will start out by covering


15
00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.541 line:-1 position:50%
some visual updates
to notifications


16
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.646 line:-1 position:50%
and how to augment them
with new API.


17
00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:50.050 line:-1 position:50%
Then we will do an overview
of new management controls


18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,487 line:-1
and how these are relevant
to communication


19
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:56,657 line:-1
and Time Sensitive
notifications.


20
00:00:56.657 --> 00:01:01.261 line:-1 position:50%
Then we will focus on
notification interruptions


21
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:05,365 line:-1
and cover new APIs
to control them.


22
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,768 line:-1
After which,
we will hone in


23
00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:10.804 line:-1 position:50%
on the two types
of notifications --


24
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,974 line:-1
Time Sensitive
and communication --


25
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:18,378 line:-1
and cover ways in which
these can be configured.


26
00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:21.982 line:-1 position:50%
Let's begin by going over
some visual updates


27
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,784 line:-1
to notifications.


28
00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.887 line:-1 position:50%
Now, notifications have
a new look


29
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:31,491 line:-1
with greater focus on the
content and the associated media


30
00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.661 line:-1 position:50%
along with the application icon.


31
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.997 line:-1 position:50%
The rich notification
presentation


32
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:39,099 line:-1
and accompanying actions


33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,003 line:-1
have been updated
to match the system style.


34
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:47,908 line:-1
You can now associate
notification actions with icons.


35
00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:51.345 line:-1 position:50%
Iconography conveys
what the action will do


36
00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:56.249 line:-1 position:50%
and provides visual context
next to the action.


37
00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.786 line:-1 position:50%
Here there are
two notification actions --


38
00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.756 line:-1 position:50%
like and comment --


39
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:08,495 line:0
and these are set on the
custom notification category.


40
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,164 line:-1
To add icons to these actions,


41
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:15,802 line:-1
create objects of type
UNNotificationActionIcon


42
00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.304 line:-1 position:50%
with the image name,


43
00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:22.642 line:-1 position:50%
either for a system image
or a template image.


44
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,513 line:-1
Then provide these icons
to the respective constructors


45
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:31,518 line:-1
for UNNotificationAction.


46
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:36,156 line:-1
When a notification associated
with this category is expanded,


47
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.958 line:-1 position:50%
the actions are presented


48
00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:42.162 line:-1 position:50%
along with the icons
that were provided for them.


49
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:46.900 line:-1 position:50%
Because notifications display
the app icon at a larger size,


50
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.406 line:-1 position:50%
provide a high-resolution icon
with the application bundle.


51
00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:56.376 line:-1 position:50%
Ensure content extensions
continue to work with


52
00:02:56,376 --> 00:03:02,249 line:-1
the new presentation and layout
of the rich notifications,


53
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:08,121 line:-1
and adopt icons for notification
actions to add more context.


54
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:13,460 line:-1
Next, let's go over new
notification management options.


55
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,330 line:-1
There are new system controls
which affect the delivery


56
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.002 line:-1 position:50%
and interruption of
notifications from applications.


57
00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:28.175 line:-1 position:50%
These are notification summary
and Focus.


58
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:32,279 line:-1
Let's discuss
notification summary first.


59
00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.748 line:-1 position:50%
Notifications can now
be delivered


60
00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:38.685 line:-1 position:50%
at scheduled times in the day
as a summary.


61
00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:42.255 line:-1 position:50%
This reduces the number
of active interruptions


62
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:46,460 line:-1
from incoming notifications
and presents them collectively


63
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,261 line:-1
at preset times.


64
00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:52.933 line:-1 position:50%
All notifications delivered
to the summary on a schedule


65
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:57,003 line:-1
are present in the notification
list on the Lock screen.


66
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,874 line:-1
Include media attachments
with the notification content


67
00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:04.911 line:-1 position:50%
so there is a better chance
for that notification


68
00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:09.916 line:-1 position:50%
to be featured at the top
of the notification summary.


69
00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:13.620 line:-1 position:50%
Adopt the new API
to provide a relevance score


70
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,622 line:-1
for the notification content


71
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:19,860 line:-1
so the right notifications from
the application get featured


72
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.296 line:-1 position:50%
in the notification
summary as well.


73
00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:26.566 line:-1 position:50%
The other management tool
relevant to notifications


74
00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.602 line:-1 position:50%
is Focus.


75
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,404 line:-1
The device can be set
in a particular Focus


76
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,941 line:-1
based on the activity
or time of day


77
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,345 line:-1
such as Reading, Sleep, or Work.


78
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,514 line:-1
When in such a configuration,


79
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:43,483 line:-1
the device will filter
the presentation


80
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,453 line:-1
and interruption
of notifications.


81
00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.754 line:-1 position:50%
Focus configuration


82
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,224 line:-1
allows selecting people
and applications


83
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,694 line:-1
that can send interruptive
notifications.


84
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,731 line:-1
For example,
during the Work Focus,


85
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:02,269 line:-1
Mail and Messages are
allowed to send notifications,


86
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,939 line:-1
along with direct communication
from coworkers.


87
00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.042 line:-1 position:50%
So notification summary
and Focus


88
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:13,480 line:-1
control which applications can
send interruptive notifications


89
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.582 line:-1 position:50%
and when.


90
00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:18.985 line:-1 position:50%
This allows better management
of interruptions


91
00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.621 line:-1 position:50%
throughout the day.


92
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,158 line:-1
There is opportunity for
notifications to break through


93
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:31,131 line:-1
these management controls,
but only if allowed to do so.


94
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,234 line:-1
It is also possible
for communication


95
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:38,038 line:-1
and Time Sensitive notifications
to break through.


96
00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:41.141 line:-1 position:50%
Next let's discuss
how applications


97
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:45.245 line:-1 position:50%
can control interruptions
tied to notifications.


98
00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:48.415 line:-1 position:50%
There is a new API
for interruption levels


99
00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:52.285 line:-1 position:50%
as part of the UserNotifications
framework.


100
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,788 line:-1
There are four distinct
interruption levels


101
00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:56.456 line:-1 position:50%
that are supported.


102
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:01,695 line:-1
These are Passive, Active,
Time Sensitive, and Critical.


103
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.431 line:-1 position:50%
Notifications with
Passive interruption level


104
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.367 line:-1 position:50%
do not alert
or light up the screen,


105
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,370 line:-1
and do not break through
system controls.


106
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,472 line:-1
These notifications
are delivered


107
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,108 line:-1
to the notification list
silently


108
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:19,512 line:-1
and are available the next time
the list is viewed.


109
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,183 line:-1
Passive interruption
should be used for notifications


110
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:27,287 line:-1
that do not require
immediate attention to interrupt


111
00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:30.490 line:-1 position:50%
but should be seen eventually.


112
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,627 line:-1
Some examples are
dining recommendations


113
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,429 line:-1
and new episode availability.


114
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:41,268 line:-1
Active interruption resembles
the behavior that exists today,


115
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,537 line:-1
where notifications
will play sound and vibrations


116
00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:47.007 line:-1 position:50%
and light up the screen.


117
00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:49.542 line:-1 position:50%
These notifications
will not break through


118
00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:52.379 line:-1 position:50%
system management
of notifications.


119
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,949 line:-1
This is the default
interruption level.


120
00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.786 line:-1 position:50%
Active interruption should be
used for notifications


121
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:04,691 line:-1
that do not warrant interrupting
if the system is configured


122
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,327 line:-1
not to be interrupted currently.


123
00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:10.530 line:-1 position:50%
Some examples
are sports updates


124
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.167 line:-1 position:50%
and live stream
video notifications.


125
00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:16.736 line:-1 position:50%
Time Sensitive notifications
alert


126
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,739 line:-1
just like active notifications.


127
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,741 line:-1
These are special because


128
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:24.277 line:-1 position:50%
they can break through
system controls


129
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,814 line:-1
such as notification summary
and Focus,


130
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,916 line:-1
if it has been allowed.


131
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,852 line:-1
These notifications
should only be used


132
00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:36.222 line:-1 position:50%
when it is relevant
to actively interrupt,


133
00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:38.792 line:-1 position:50%
requiring immediate attention.


134
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,661 line:-1
Some instances
are account security


135
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,531 line:-1
and package delivery alerts.


136
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:48,268 line:-1
Lastly, Critical interruption
level is equivalent


137
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:53,540 line:-1
to the Critical notification
support that exists in iOS 14.


138
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.476 line:-1 position:50%
Notifications with
this interruption level


139
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,313 line:-1
actively alert, break through
system controls,


140
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,317 line:-1
and also bypass
the ringer switch on the device.


141
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,287 line:-1
Because of this disruptive
behavior,


142
00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:09.789 line:-1 position:50%
critical interruption
will continue


143
00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:13.193 line:-1 position:50%
to require an approved
entitlement.


144
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,929 line:-1
Some use cases
for critical notifications


145
00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:19.766 line:-1 position:50%
are severe weather
and local safety alerts.


146
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:23,770 line:-1
To support the new API in
the UserNotifications framework,


147
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,974 line:-1
there is a new enum for
UNNotificationInterruptionLevel


148
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,510 line:-1
with the different
levels defined.


149
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.847 line:-1 position:50%
Set this interruption level
while configuring


150
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:38,084 line:-1
the content object
for the notification request.


151
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,755 line:-1
Passive is set in this example.


152
00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:44.157 line:-1 position:50%
If no interruption level
is provided,


153
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,227 line:-1
then the default level is used.


154
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:51,798 line:-1
For a push notification payload,
provide a new key-value pair,


155
00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:54.801 line:-1 position:50%
with the key interruption level.


156
00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:59.305 line:-1 position:50%
Here again, set the
interruption level as passive.


157
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,409 line:-1
When this notification
is delivered to the device,


158
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,844 line:-1
it will be visible
on the Lock screen


159
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:09,949 line:-1
without any interruptions, since
it was configured as passive.


160
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,653 line:-1
Another form of interruption
tied to notifications


161
00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:15.622 line:-1 position:50%
is Announce.


162
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:18,024 line:-1
Siri can announce notifications


163
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,360 line:-1
if there are
compatible devices --


164
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,597 line:-1
such as AirPods Pro
and AirPods Max -- connected.


165
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,901 line:-1
To get this announce
behavior in iOS 14,


166
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,870 line:-1
notifications had to be
tied to a category


167
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.007 line:-1 position:50%
that requests the
AllowAnnouncement option.


168
00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:37.710 line:-1 position:50%
In iOS 15, the requirement
for this category option


169
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,412 line:-1
is deprecated.


170
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,283 line:-1
Now announce is supported
for any notification


171
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,486 line:-1
while connected
to a supported audio device.


172
00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:49.722 line:-1 position:50%
Communication and
Time Sensitive notifications


173
00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:52.158 line:-1 position:50%
will be announced by default.


174
00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:55.895 line:-1 position:50%
While connected to CarPlay,
communication notifications


175
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,032 line:-1
can be configured
to announce automatically,


176
00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:01.835 line:-1 position:50%
making the experience
more seamless.


177
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:05,672 line:-1
Next let's focus on
Time Sensitive notifications


178
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,041 line:-1
and how to configure them.


179
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:09.742 line:-1 position:50%
Time Sensitive notifications


180
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:13,012 line:-1
are those that require
immediate attention.


181
00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:14.581 line:-1 position:50%
Because of their importance,


182
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:17,083 line:-1
these can breakthrough
system controls


183
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:22,922 line:-1
such as notification summary
and Focus if allowed to do so.


184
00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:25.725 line:-1 position:50%
An example of
a Time Sensitive notification


185
00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:29.462 line:-1 position:50%
is one from Reminders
about taking medication.


186
00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:33.700 line:-1 position:50%
This notification is posted
immediately and prominently,


187
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,202 line:-1
breaking through the Work Focus.


188
00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:38.938 line:-1 position:50%
It is important
to maintain trust


189
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,674 line:-1
when sending
Time Sensitive notifications.


190
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,011 line:-1
Do not overuse
their interruptive nature


191
00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:49.782 line:-1 position:50%
and only use them
when it is relevant to do so.


192
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:54,654 line:-1
Know that there is an option to
turn off Time Sensitive alerts


193
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,458 line:-1
or even all notifications
from an application.


194
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,294 line:-1
To configure Time Sensitive
notifications,


195
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,664 line:-1
enable the associated capability
via Xcode


196
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,433 line:-1
for your application.


197
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,903 line:-1
Set the Time Sensitive
interruption level


198
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:13,339 line:-1
on the notification request
being posted.


199
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,208 line:-1
For a local notification,


200
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,343 line:-1
the Time Sensitive
interruption level


201
00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.812 line:-1 position:50%
is set on the content object.


202
00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:21.180 line:-1 position:50%
For a push payload,


203
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,252 line:-1
set the interruption-level key
with value as time-sensitive.


204
00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.654 line:-1 position:50%
When delivered,


205
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,657 line:-1
this notification
is posted prominently,


206
00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:33.192 line:-1 position:50%
highlighting the urgency.


207
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,362 line:-1
Let's discuss
communication notifications.


208
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,266 line:-1
And to tell you all about them,
let me hand over to Kevin.


209
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,534 line:-1
Kevin?


210
00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:42.769 line:-1 position:50%
Kevin Harrington:
Thanks, Kritarth.


211
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,307 line:-1
I'm Kevin, an engineer
on the Notifications team.


212
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,943 line:-1
There's an importance
for urgent notifications


213
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,413 line:-1
breaking through Focus
and notification summaries.


214
00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:56.683 line:-1 position:50%
Communications from people
also warrant


215
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:59,118 line:-1
elevated notification delivery.


216
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,689 line:-1
These communications
can come in many forms,


217
00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:05.258 line:-1 position:50%
including calls and messages.


218
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:09,295 line:-1
I will highlight a new API
that allows your applications


219
00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:12.365 line:-1 position:50%
to signal what notifications
are communications,


220
00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:16.402 line:-1 position:50%
and the people associated with
those communications.


221
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:19.806 line:-1 position:50%
The importance of
communication notifications


222
00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:22.875 line:-1 position:50%
is determined by user decisions.


223
00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:26.346 line:-1 position:50%
Siri Suggestions helps
inform these decisions,


224
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:30,883 line:-1
suggesting important people that
should be allowed to interrupt.


225
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,620 line:-1
As your user interacts
with the device --


226
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,791 line:-1
taking calls, joining FaceTimes,
sending messages --


227
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,562 line:-1
Siri learns who is a candidate
to break through Focus


228
00:12:42.562 --> 00:12:44.831 line:-1 position:50%
and Notification Summaries.


229
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:48.401 line:-1 position:50%
In iOS 15, communication
notifications


230
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:51.337 line:-1 position:50%
get a richer user experience.


231
00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:54.641 line:-1 position:50%
Most visible are
the prominent avatars.


232
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,577 line:-1
The title and subtitle
are standardized.


233
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:01,180 line:-1
It always includes the sender
in the title,


234
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,650 line:-1
and in the case
of group communications,


235
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,152 line:-1
recipients in the subtitle.


236
00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:10.023 line:-1 position:50%
The title and subtitle text
are localized and formatted


237
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,159 line:-1
for all devices,
across platforms.


238
00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:17.430 line:-1 position:50%
For example, watch prefers
to show just first names


239
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.566 line:-1 position:50%
for recipients of
a group communication.


240
00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:21.801 line:-1 position:50%
Siri will now announce


241
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.971 line:-1 position:50%
the contents of communication
notifications


242
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:30,576 line:-1
on supported devices including
HomePod, AirPods, and CarPlay.


243
00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:32.578 line:-1 position:50%
And Siri will provide
suggestions


244
00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:37.116 line:-1 position:50%
to help prioritize these
communication notifications.


245
00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:39.686 line:-1 position:50%
People in your apps
will get associated


246
00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:41.854 line:-1 position:50%
with people in Contacts.


247
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,657 line:-1
These associations
are shown as suggestions


248
00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.126 line:-1 position:50%
on notifications.


249
00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:50.129 line:-1 position:50%
Once a user
confirms a suggestion,


250
00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:53.433 line:-1 position:50%
Siri Shortcuts are available
for tasks


251
00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:56.436 line:-1 position:50%
with those people in your app.


252
00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:59.639 line:-1 position:50%
Siri will suggest relevant
people to break through


253
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,710 line:-1
in the Focus configuration --
including those people


254
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.346 line:-1 position:50%
associated with communications
in your app.


255
00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:11.350 line:-1 position:50%
To make these decisions on what
is and isn't a communication,


256
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.588 line:-1 position:50%
this new API lets you add
SiriKit call and message intents


257
00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.657 line:-1 position:50%
to Notifications.


258
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,827 line:-1
Intents are driven
by common tasks.


259
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:24,464 line:-1
Your app donates these
intents when events happen,


260
00:14:24.464 --> 00:14:28.267 line:-1 position:50%
like placing a call
or receiving a message.


261
00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:32.138 line:-1 position:50%
From there, Siri provides
shortcuts and suggestions


262
00:14:32.138 --> 00:14:34.040 line:-1 position:50%
based on these intents,


263
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,477 line:-1
like people in your apps
to message from share sheet


264
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:41,447 line:-1
or to start a call
from your app via Siri.


265
00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:46.119 line:-1 position:50%
This new API associates these
same intents with notifications


266
00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:50.990 line:-1 position:50%
to further integrate your apps
into the Siri ecosystem.


267
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,027 line:-1
Using SiriKit intents for
communication notifications


268
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,463 line:-1
will increase engagement
in your apps


269
00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:59.932 line:-1 position:50%
while maintaining consistency


270
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:04,137 line:-1
throughout your app, Siri,
and system UI.


271
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:08,007 line:-1
The intents that represent
relevant communications


272
00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:12.612 line:-1 position:50%
are the StartCall
and SendMessage intents.


273
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:17,049 line:-1
The NotificationContentProviding
protocol is the mechanism


274
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,386 line:-1
to associate intents
with notifications.


275
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,955 line:-1
On a NotificationContent
object,


276
00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:26.192 line:-1 position:50%
call updating with
a ContentProviding intent


277
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,594 line:-1
for communication treatment.


278
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:32,832 line:-1
StartCall and SendMessage
intents conforms to providing.


279
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,668 line:-1
Communication notifications
are delivered


280
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,337 line:-1
through Apple Push Notification
service.


281
00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:41.541 line:-1 position:50%
You need to update
a NotificationContent object


282
00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:43.109 line:-1 position:50%
with a SiriKit intent


283
00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:46.813 line:-1 position:50%
in your app's
NotificationServiceExtension.


284
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,482 line:-1
SiriKit intents
are local to the device,


285
00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:52.518 line:-1 position:50%
and thus must
be serviced locally.


286
00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:56.389 line:-1 position:50%
The service extension
is for exactly these cases.


287
00:15:56.389 --> 00:16:00.660 line:-1 position:50%
It is the place to customize the
content of a remote notification


288
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.895 line:-1 position:50%
before it is delivered.


289
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,265 line:-1
You can also do this
in your main app process


290
00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:08.768 line:-1 position:50%
for local notifications.


291
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,469 line:-1
In your didReceive function,


292
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,540 line:-1
update the content of
a push payload with an intent.


293
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.111 line:-1 position:50%
For messaging notifications,
create a SendMessageIntent.


294
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,614 line:-1
And for call-related
notifications,


295
00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:23.783 line:-1 position:50%
use a StartCallIntent.


296
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:27,186 line:-1
Create an interaction
to tell Siri intelligence


297
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,021 line:-1
what is happening.


298
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,324 line:-1
In a notification extension,


299
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,560 line:-1
the interaction direction
is always incoming.


300
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,830 line:-1
This is an event
that is happening to the user;


301
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,967 line:-1
they are receiving
the incoming call.


302
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,302 line:-1
Next, you need to donate
the interaction.


303
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,137 line:-1
Donations also help the system


304
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,207 line:-1
make better suggestions
in the future.


305
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:52,478 line:-1
Update the content of your
notification with the intent.


306
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,947 line:-1
And finally,
call the contentHandler


307
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,350 line:-1
with the returned intent.


308
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,920 line:-1
Donations are required
so Siri can learn from events


309
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.055 line:-1 position:50%
that happen in your apps.


310
00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:04.657 line:-1 position:50%
The interaction direction


311
00:17:04.657 --> 00:17:07.727 line:-1 position:50%
is always incoming
for notifications.


312
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,831 line:-1
For other SiriKit uses,
the direction can be outgoing


313
00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:14.834 line:-1 position:50%
for actions initiated
on the device,


314
00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:19.238 line:-1 position:50%
like sending an outgoing message
or placing a call.


315
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,807 line:-1
Only system objects
that conform


316
00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:24.410 line:-1 position:50%
to content providing
are supported.


317
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,881 line:-1
Do not conform your objects
to content providing.


318
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:31.450 line:-1 position:50%
To send communication
notifications,


319
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,221 line:-1
enable the communication
capability via Xcode


320
00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.856 line:-1 position:50%
for your application.


321
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:41,827 line:-1
Support communication intents
by adding intent types to


322
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,431 line:-1
your user activity types array
in Info.plist


323
00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:48.968 line:-1 position:50%
or by implementing
an intents extension.


324
00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:51.671 line:-1 position:50%
Donate communication intents
when the user


325
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,973 line:-1
takes actions
in your app foreground,


326
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:57,977 line:-1
like when the users hits send
after composing a message.


327
00:17:57.977 --> 00:18:00.880 line:-1 position:50%
Siri then uses outgoing intents
to better aide


328
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.882 line:-1 position:50%
in who should be suggested


329
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,718 line:-1
to break through Focus
and Summaries.


330
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,820 line:-1
Same for Contacts suggestions.


331
00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.821 line:-1 position:50%
For this feature,


332
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,024 line:-1
Siri only learns from
outgoing intent donations,


333
00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:16.128 line:-1 position:50%
so Contacts are not cluttered
by people not engaged with --


334
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,331 line:-1
like spam callers.


335
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,400 line:-1
The proper usage
of communication intents


336
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:26.272 line:-1 position:50%
is fundamental to an intelligent
notification experience,


337
00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:29.308 line:-1 position:50%
and there are
a few gotchas to cover.


338
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,111 line:-1
Intent persons are
the building blocks


339
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,981 line:-1
of SendMessage
and StartCall intents.


340
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:37,883 line:-1
Each and every parameter
you populate


341
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:42,621 line:-1
provides a richer and more
intelligent user experience.


342
00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:46.726 line:-1 position:50%
Same goes with creating intents
with intent persons;


343
00:18:46.726 --> 00:18:49.328 line:-1 position:50%
each and every parameter
you populate


344
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:54,266 line:-1
provides a richer and more
intelligent user experience.


345
00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:57.169 line:-1 position:50%
Start using intents
if you don't already.


346
00:18:57.169 --> 00:19:01.273 line:-1 position:50%
Intents will provide
more visibility to your app


347
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,978 line:-1
in notifications, share sheet,
Contacts, and Spotlight.


348
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,016 line:-1
And you can use SiriKit
to offer Siri Shortcuts


349
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:13,753 line:-1
like sending a message
or starting a call.


350
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,188 line:-1
Get in the habit
of donating intents


351
00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:20.493 line:-1 position:50%
for both incoming and outgoing
interactions.


352
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,130 line:-1
You might already be donating
outgoing intents.


353
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.732 line:-1 position:50%
Start donating incoming
StartCall


354
00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:30.636 line:-1 position:50%
and SendMessage intents
in your service extension.


355
00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:32.738 line:-1 position:50%
This is fundamental


356
00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:36.642 line:-1 position:50%
to the communication
notification experience.


357
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,944 line:-1
If your app doesn't already use


358
00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:41.614 line:-1 position:50%
a notification service
extension,


359
00:19:41.614 --> 00:19:43.883 line:-1 position:50%
you'll want to add one.


360
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,052 line:-1
Finally, put the pieces together


361
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,954 line:-1
by using
the content providing protocol


362
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,858 line:-1
to decorate each notification
you want delivered


363
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,127 line:-1
as a communication.


364
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,763 line:-1
We've covered a lot
in this session,


365
00:19:57.763 --> 00:20:01.801 line:-1 position:50%
from visual updates to
communication notifications.


366
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,803 line:-1
Here are a few takeaways.


367
00:20:03.803 --> 00:20:07.673 line:-1 position:50%
Account for the new visual
updates and management options


368
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:11,477 line:-1
and ensure that notifications
work seamlessly with them.


369
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,547 line:-1
Adopt interruption levels
to have better control


370
00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:17.149 line:-1 position:50%
over how
a notification interrupts


371
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,852 line:-1
in synergy with system controls.


372
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:24,190 line:-1
Use Time Sensitive
notifications when relevant


373
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,027 line:-1
to prominently interrupt
and get automatic behaviors


374
00:20:28.027 --> 00:20:30.729 line:-1 position:50%
such as breakthrough
and announce.


375
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,999 line:-1
Implement and donate
call and messaging intents


376
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,303 line:-1
to get the upgraded
communication experience


377
00:20:37.303 --> 00:20:39.171 line:-1 position:50%
tied to notifications,


378
00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:42.608 line:-1 position:50%
along with breakthrough
and announce behavior.


379
00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:46.679 line:-1 position:50%
We can't wait to see all
the new and amazing experiences


380
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,248 line:-1
you build around notifications.


381
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,252 line:-1
We hope you all
have a great WWDC!
