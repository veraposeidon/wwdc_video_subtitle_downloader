[Austin]
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


5
00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:12.846 line:-1 align:center
I'm Austin, and I work


6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,481 line:-2
on the Apps and Books
Management API.


7
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.783 line:-2 align:center
I'll be sharing with you
improvements we have brought


8
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,285 line:-1
to a new API version,


9
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,255 line:-2
enabling your MDM solution
to manage Apps and Books


10
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,591 line:-2
in a faster and more
scalable way than ever before.


11
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.760 line:-1 align:center
You're likely already using


12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,362 line:-2
the Apps and Books
Management API


13
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,431 line:-2
to enable organizations
using your product


14
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,534 line:-2
to manage their owned
apps and books.


15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,870 line:-2
The organization may have
acquired these assets


16
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.739 line:-2 align:center
through either
Apple School Manager


17
00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.108 line:-1 align:center
or Apple Business Manager.


18
00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:43.844 line:-2 align:center
And the API allows
for you to assign


19
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,279 line:-1
these owned apps and books


20
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:49,149 line:-2
to the organization's
managed users and devices.


21
00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.652 line:-2 align:center
We've introduced a lot
of changes this year


22
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,054 line:-1
to the new Apps and Books API.


23
00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.024 line:-2 align:center
We'll cover many of these
throughout this session


24
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,992 line:-2
but focus
on the two enhancements


25
00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.528 line:-2 align:center
that will most improve
your workflows:


26
00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.163 line:-1 align:center
Real-time notifications


27
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,032 line:-1
and Asynchronous processing.


28
00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.734 line:-2 align:center
For an in-depth look
at the other changes,


29
00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.803 line:-2 align:center
see the new
developer documentation


30
00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:13.507 line:-2 align:center
within the Device Management
section on developer.apple.com


31
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,943 line:-2
and in the references
for this session.


32
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,579 line:-2
Let's get started
with Real-time notifications.


33
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.250 line:-2 align:center
We now support Real-time
notifications for state changes


34
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,620 line:-2
to assignments, assets,
and registered users.


35
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,056 line:-2
You need to opt-in
to these notifications,


36
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,958 line:-2
and you will only
receive notifications


37
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,861 line:-2
for the types you subscribe
to in client config.


38
00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:39.066 line:-2 align:center
Real-time notifications
finally remove the need


39
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.001 line:-2 align:center
for you
to continually sync state.


40
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,338 line:-2
Let's discuss the notification
types a little more in-depth.


41
00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:47.074 line:-2 align:center
The first notification type
is for assignments.


42
00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.178 line:-2 align:center
An assignment is
when an asset is allocated


43
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,314 line:-2
to either a user or device
managed by an organization.


44
00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:57.718 line:-2 align:center
If you have to wait
for confirmation


45
00:01:57.718 --> 00:01:59.219 line:-2 align:center
that entire groups
of assignments


46
00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.088 line:-2 align:center
have been performed
successfully,


47
00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:02.222 line:-1 align:center
that will lead to delays


48
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,424 line:-2
in installing the content
that users need.


49
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,460 line:-2
Now, with assignment
notifications,


50
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,229 line:-2
you'll know in real-time
exactly what assignments


51
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.999 line:-2 align:center
have successfully been performed
and to which devices.


52
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,102 line:-2
You subscribe
to the asset management


53
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,971 line:-2
notification type in client
config to receive these.


54
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,708 line:-2
Apple will then proceed
to notify you


55
00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:25.179 line:-2 align:center
when assignment states are
altered by either an associate,


56
00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.714 line:-2 align:center
disassociate,
or revoke assets event.


57
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,385 line:-2
You may now rely
on these notifications


58
00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:32.986 line:-1 align:center
to provide users and devices


59
00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.722 line:-2 align:center
faster access to content
as they are assigned.


60
00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:38.025 line:-2 align:center
Let's look at an example
of this notification.


61
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,828 line:-2
When an assignment occurs,
you get this notification.


62
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,165 line:-2
The example here was triggered
by an associate assets call.


63
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.669 line:-1 align:center
Apple posts these notifications


64
00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.838 line:-2 align:center
with a shared secret
in the authorization header


65
00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:54.107 line:-2 align:center
provided by you
in client config.


66
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,043 line:-2
The notification
contains a payload,


67
00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:58.545 line:-2 align:center
which is specific
to a given notification type.


68
00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:02.916 line:-2 align:center
The type is denoted here,
which for this notification


69
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,518 line:-1
is asset management.


70
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.153 line:-1 align:center
In our notification payload,


71
00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:08.455 line:-1 align:center
we can see the assignments


72
00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:10.490 line:-2 align:center
whose state has attempted
to be altered,


73
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,628 line:-2
event ID, the unique identifier


74
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,030 line:-2
for this MDM-triggered
asynchronous event.


75
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,765 line:-2
We'll get into
more detail regarding


76
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,602 line:-2
the asynchronous nature
of our new API in a bit.


77
00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:25.138 line:-2 align:center
Here is the result
of the state change,


78
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,007 line:-1
whether it succeeded or failed.


79
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:31,211 line:-2
And the type of change
to assignment state,


80
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.713 line:-1 align:center
which here is an associate.


81
00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:35.415 line:-2 align:center
The next notification
type is for assets.


82
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,987 line:-2
Assets are apps and books that
an organization has purchased


83
00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:43.524 line:-2 align:center
in either Apple School Manager
or Apple Business Manager.


84
00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:47.261 line:-2 align:center
That organization is not able
to manage and assign the assets


85
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.831 line:-2 align:center
until your MDM knows
that they own the content.


86
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:54.401 line:-2 align:center
With asset notifications,
you're notified in real-time


87
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.737 line:-2 align:center
when changes to assets
occur from purchases,


88
00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:58.572 line:-1 align:center
transfers, or refunds,


89
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,941 line:-1
and your MDM can always know


90
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.610 line:-2 align:center
the current available
count of each asset.


91
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.380 line:-2 align:center
You subscribe to the asset count
notification type


92
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,315 line:-2
in client config
to receive these.


93
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.052 line:-2 align:center
Apple will then proceed
to notify you


94
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,922 line:-2
when an asset state changes
due to either a buy,


95
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,090 line:-1
transfer, or refund event.


96
00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.360 line:-2 align:center
These notifications
will allow you


97
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.762 line:-1 align:center
to quickly provide users


98
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,764 line:-2
with their recently
purchased assets.


99
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,399 line:-2
Let's also take
a look at an example


100
00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.167 line:-1 align:center
of this notification


101
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,969 line:-2
with the context
of what the state of assets


102
00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.270 line:-1 align:center
looked like before.


103
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.072 line:-2 align:center
To get the current state
of assets,


104
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,107 line:-2
we call
the "get assets" endpoint.


105
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,810 line:-2
This is the new
asset sync endpoint,


106
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.912 line:-2 align:center
which you can note
by both the proper HTTP


107
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:42,182 line:-2
request method of GET
and the versioned URI.


108
00:04:42.182 --> 00:04:44.451 line:-2 align:center
Here, we are querying
with the query parameters


109
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.320 line:-1 align:center
of adamId and pricingParam


110
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.622 line:-2 align:center
to receive the state
of a single asset.


111
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,892 line:-2
We are now requiring
that the server token


112
00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:54.895 line:-2 align:center
or sToken is provided
in the authorization header


113
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,830 line:-1
of all new API requests


114
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.299 line:-1 align:center
in this bearer token format.


115
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.035 line:-2 align:center
We see in the assets array
of this response


116
00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.770 line:-2 align:center
for the asset
we are interested in,


117
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,139 line:-2
there are 10,000 available
for assignment


118
00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.575 line:-1 align:center
and 15,000 in total.


119
00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:11.645 line:-2 align:center
When a buy happens,
you will get this notification.


120
00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.514 line:-1 align:center
We see in the payload,


121
00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:17.317 line:-2 align:center
the adamId for the asset
that was purchased.


122
00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:22.222 line:-2 align:center
Then the delta, which in this
case is a positive integer.


123
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:25,626 line:-2
This could either denote
a buy or a transfer.


124
00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:27.728 line:-2 align:center
You'd use this delta
to update your counts


125
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:31,265 line:-2
without making another call
to the asset sync endpoint.


126
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,535 line:-2
The last notification types
are for registered users.


127
00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:37.337 line:-2 align:center
Most deployments rely
on device-based assignments,


128
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,873 line:-2
but when you need
to assign content to users,


129
00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:42.442 line:-2 align:center
creating registered users
is the first step.


130
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,980 line:-2
Associating these users
to either personal


131
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.617 line:-2 align:center
or managed Apple IDs is then
necessary for deployment.


132
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,320 line:-2
For a user's personal Apple ID
to be associated


133
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,989 line:-2
to a registered user
for a given sToken,


134
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,258 line:-2
the user must accept
an invitation


135
00:05:58.258 --> 00:05:59.993 line:-1 align:center
to associate their Apple ID.


136
00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:02.429 line:-2 align:center
Now, with registered
user notifications,


137
00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:04.364 line:-1 align:center
you'll be updated in real-time


138
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.099 line:-1 align:center
with the latest state of users,


139
00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.135 line:-1 align:center
both for their initial creation


140
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,804 line:-2
and subsequent
invitation acceptance.


141
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,307 line:-2
You subscribe
to the user management


142
00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:16.076 line:-2 align:center
and user associated
notification types


143
00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:18.212 line:-2 align:center
in client config
to receive these.


144
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,215 line:-2
Then Apple will notify you
when user states are altered


145
00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:23.817 line:-1 align:center
by either create, associate,


146
00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:25.953 line:-1 align:center
update, or retire user events.


147
00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:29.423 line:-2 align:center
The user associated
notifications


148
00:06:29.423 --> 00:06:31.291 line:-2 align:center
specifically allow you
to better track


149
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,193 line:-2
when a user has
accepted an invitation


150
00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:35.162 line:-1 align:center
to associate their Apple ID.


151
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:38,065 line:-2
Let's take a look at an example
of these notifications


152
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,967 line:-2
with the context
of what the state of users


153
00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.301 line:-1 align:center
looked like prior.


154
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,470 line:-2
In order to get
the current state of users,


155
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.373 line:-1 align:center
we call the get users endpoint.


156
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,509 line:-2
This is the new users
sync endpoint.


157
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,812 line:-2
Here, filtering only for
the user we are interested in


158
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,081 line:-2
by the clientUserId
query parameter.


159
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:57.784 line:-2 align:center
This will limit the response
size to only one user.


160
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,587 line:-2
Here, we have some common
pagination fields found


161
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,022 line:-1
across our sync API,


162
00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:04.658 line:-2 align:center
indicating the current
page index, size,


163
00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:07.060 line:-2 align:center
or in this context,
the number of user objects


164
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.328 line:-1 align:center
in the current page,


165
00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:10.964 line:-2 align:center
and the total pages
in the provided query.


166
00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:15.269 line:-2 align:center
In our users array,
we can see the only user


167
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,703 line:-2
we are interested in,
in this case,


168
00:07:16.703 --> 00:07:19.439 line:-2 align:center
with a status of registered,
as opposed to associated,


169
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.974 line:-1 align:center
and an invitation code.


170
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,743 line:-1
This user has clearly yet


171
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,212 line:-1
to be associated to an Apple ID.


172
00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:28.749 line:-2 align:center
All our sync API also include
a version identifier,


173
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:30.851 line:-2 align:center
which will change
whenever a write occurs


174
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.186 line:-1 align:center
to the underlying data.


175
00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:33.887 line:-1 align:center
This can be extremely useful


176
00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:35.489 line:-1 align:center
when traversing large responses


177
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,792 line:-2
to indicate when data
on prior pages may have changed.


178
00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:41.328 line:-2 align:center
You can associate
a managed Apple ID


179
00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:42.829 line:-1 align:center
to a registered user using


180
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,465 line:-1
the new update users endpoint.


181
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,102 line:-2
This results in a registered
user notification as seen here.


182
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,504 line:-1
In our notification payload,


183
00:07:50.504 --> 00:07:53.340 line:-1 align:center
we see users whose state


184
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,075 line:-1
has attempted to be altered,


185
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:59,279 line:-2
unique identifier for this MDM
triggered asynchronous event,


186
00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:00.781 line:-1 align:center
the result of the state change,


187
00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:03.050 line:-1 align:center
whether it succeeded or failed,


188
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.987 line:-2 align:center
the type of change to user
state, which here is an update.


189
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,090 line:-2
Looking at the users array,
we see the clientUserId


190
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,125 line:-2
for the user's state
we are interested in,


191
00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.862 line:-2 align:center
containing an idHash
and status of associated,


192
00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:17.564 line:-2 align:center
concluding that the managed
Apple ID association


193
00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:19.132 line:-1 align:center
was successful.


194
00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:21.602 line:-2 align:center
You use this to update
your state of this user


195
00:08:21.602 --> 00:08:24.738 line:-2 align:center
without making another call
to the user sync endpoint.


196
00:08:24.738 --> 00:08:26.406 line:-1 align:center
Instead of you associating,


197
00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:27.708 line:-1 align:center
it is instead possible


198
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,910 line:-2
that you provide the user
with an invitation link


199
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.380 line:-2 align:center
to associate their own Apple ID
to the registered user.


200
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,717 line:-2
Here, we are looking at that
associated user notification.


201
00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:39.686 line:-2 align:center
We see in the notification
payload the user object


202
00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:42.656 line:-2 align:center
containing the information
regarding the associated user


203
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,659 line:-2
including but not limited
to their clientUserId,


204
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,862 line:-2
an idHash indicating
an associated Apple ID,


205
00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.697 line:-1 align:center
the invite code they accepted,


206
00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.367 line:-1 align:center
and status denoting associated.


207
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,702 line:-2
You use this to update
your state of this user


208
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,539 line:-2
without making another call
to the user sync endpoint.


209
00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:03.744 line:-2 align:center
Let's talk about how you enroll
to receive these notifications.


210
00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:06.180 line:-2 align:center
You must opt in
via client config


211
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.515 line:-1 align:center
for each sToken you manage.


212
00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.486 line:-2 align:center
You provide a shared secret
for authentication


213
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,521 line:-1
with the notificationAuthToken


214
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,658 line:-2
and the notificationUrl
to post these to.


215
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,394 line:-2
The token is used to verify
that these notifications


216
00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:22.329 line:-1 align:center
are, in fact, coming from Apple,


217
00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:25.432 line:-2 align:center
and this can be updated anytime
via client config.


218
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.170 line:-2 align:center
Provide an HTTP
200-level response


219
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.873 line:-2 align:center
when you receive notifications
in order to let Apple know


220
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,108 line:-2
that they've been
delivered successfully.


221
00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:37.511 line:-2 align:center
Apple will attempt
to retry the notification


222
00:09:37.511 --> 00:09:39.413 line:-2 align:center
if a non-200 response
is returned


223
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,481 line:-1
or a timeout occurs.


224
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,318 line:-2
Apple will provide
a best-effort delivery.


225
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,687 line:-2
This attempt to reach you
will be made a few times


226
00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:48.856 line:-2 align:center
before discarding
the notification.


227
00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:51.258 line:-2 align:center
This means if you are unable
to receive notifications


228
00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:52.559 line:-1 align:center
for any period of time,


229
00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:55.128 line:-2 align:center
you will need to poll
for the latest state.


230
00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:57.297 line:-1 align:center
Sync only for what you know


231
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,932 line:-2
to be in
a potentially stale state


232
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:01.134 line:-2 align:center
as a result
of the missed notifications.


233
00:10:01.702 --> 00:10:04.538 line:-2 align:center
The second major enhancement
brought to this new API


234
00:10:04.538 --> 00:10:06.507 line:-1 align:center
is asynchronous processing.


235
00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:09.743 line:-2 align:center
In the initial version
of the API,


236
00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:12.212 line:-2 align:center
all management was
performed synchronously.


237
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,348 line:-2
You make a request
to manage some assets,


238
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,983 line:-2
and Apple performs
the management


239
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,985 line:-2
while you wait
for a synchronous response.


240
00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:20.320 line:-2 align:center
This meant you
handled parallelism,


241
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.155 line:-1 align:center
whereas asynchronous processing


242
00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:25.459 line:-2 align:center
enables server-enforced
parallelism on Apple's end.


243
00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:27.628 line:-2 align:center
This results
in processing optimizations,


244
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,831 line:-2
which leads to larger requests
being fulfilled more quickly.


245
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,867 line:-2
Ordered processing
reduces the amount


246
00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:36.537 line:-2 align:center
of intermittent failures
and subsequent retries due


247
00:10:36.537 --> 00:10:38.539 line:-2 align:center
to your specific
request patterns.


248
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,375 line:-1
And this ultimately leads


249
00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.110 line:-2 align:center
to stress-free
large deployments,


250
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,547 line:-2
and, for education,
easier back-to-school seasons.


251
00:10:46.547 --> 00:10:49.616 line:-2 align:center
Apple has already benefited
from asynchronous processing


252
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,852 line:-2
for Apps and Books,
purchases, and transfers


253
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:55,122 line:-2
in both Apple School Manager
and Apple Business Manager,


254
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,858 line:-2
allowing organizations
to see inventory on hand


255
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,660 line:-1
in minutes rather than hours.


256
00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:02.996 line:-2 align:center
Let's look at how
this all comes together


257
00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:06.934 line:-2 align:center
to make for a great new Apps
and Books management experience.


258
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,138 line:-2
Say there's an organization
that you manage


259
00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:14.274 line:-2 align:center
with 10,000 users,
each with their own device.


260
00:11:15.409 --> 00:11:17.711 line:-2 align:center
And you're asked
to assign 25 apps


261
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,914 line:-2
that are critical for their
daily tasks to each device.


262
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,618 line:-1
You're looking at performing


263
00:11:24.618 --> 00:11:27.955 line:-1 align:center
250,000 assignments.


264
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,457 line:-2
Let's look at how you would
have done this previously.


265
00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:33.927 line:-1 align:center
Your server makes a request


266
00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:36.630 line:-1 align:center
to Apple to manage licenses.


267
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.266 line:-2 align:center
Apple returns a response
to you synchronously.


268
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,567 line:-1
This response would contain


269
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,537 line:-2
the licenses assigned
to requested devices.


270
00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:48.675 line:-2 align:center
This single request
manages only one app


271
00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:50.978 line:-1 align:center
up to a maximum of ten devices,


272
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:53,480 line:-2
resulting in only
ten assignments.


273
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,585 line:-2
This requires a minimum
of 25,000 requests


274
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,488 line:-2
to perform
the 250,000 assignments.


275
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:02,856 line:-1
With the new API,


276
00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:05.058 line:-1 align:center
this 25,000 minimum requests


277
00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:08.262 line:-1 align:center
becomes just 10 requests,


278
00:12:08.262 --> 00:12:11.665 line:-2 align:center
all possible by moving
to asynchronous processing.


279
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,001 line:-2
Let's look at how
you achieve this.


280
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,104 line:-2
On the left,
we now have the addition


281
00:12:17.104 --> 00:12:19.273 line:-1 align:center
of your notification server.


282
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,575 line:-2
Process still starts
with you making a request


283
00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:24.244 line:-1 align:center
to Apple to manage assets.


284
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,947 line:-2
In the request,
you provide the sToken


285
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,949 line:-1
in the authorization header.


286
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,318 line:-2
You can now provide us
with multiple assets


287
00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:34.755 line:-2 align:center
in a single request,
up to 25 currently.


288
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,791 line:-2
This dynamic limit is
exposed in service config


289
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,395 line:-1
and provide up to 1,000 devices


290
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:42,796 line:-1
to perform assignment to,


291
00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:44.364 line:-1 align:center
another dynamic limit


292
00:12:44.364 --> 00:12:47.301 line:-1 align:center
also exposed in service config.


293
00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:49.970 line:-2 align:center
Apple will return a response
synchronously to you.


294
00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:53.874 line:-2 align:center
In this response,
we have the HTTP status code,


295
00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:56.143 line:-2 align:center
which is important
to this new API.


296
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:59,580 line:-2
We return appropriate
non-200 status codes for errors,


297
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,115 line:-2
so you should initially
interrogate the response


298
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,586 line:-2
to ensure it is a 200
before proceeding.


299
00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:07.187 line:-1 align:center
Then, most importantly,


300
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,655 line:-1
we have the unique identifier


301
00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:10.357 line:-1 align:center
for this asynchronous event


302
00:13:10.357 --> 00:13:12.326 line:-2 align:center
whose status
can either be gotten


303
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:15,095 line:-2
from calling our new
event status endpoint


304
00:13:15.095 --> 00:13:18.565 line:-2 align:center
or by waiting for matching
assignment notifications.


305
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,768 line:-2
As the assignments complete,
assuming you are subscribed,


306
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:25,005 line:-2
Apple will post
notifications to you.


307
00:13:25.005 --> 00:13:27.741 line:-2 align:center
In each of these notifications,
we have a subset


308
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,743 line:-2
of the requested
assignments listed


309
00:13:29.743 --> 00:13:32.145 line:-1 align:center
in our notification payload,


310
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,448 line:-2
the metadata
regarding the assignments,


311
00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:37.484 line:-2 align:center
indicating whether it
was a success or a failure,


312
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,587 line:-2
the type,
and the corresponding event ID.


313
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,089 line:-1
You should wait for these


314
00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:43.857 line:-2 align:center
successful assignment
notifications


315
00:13:43.857 --> 00:13:46.126 line:-2 align:center
to then proceed
with sending install commands


316
00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:48.128 line:-1 align:center
to the devices listed.


317
00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:49.396 line:-1 align:center
Another advantage


318
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,765 line:-2
of our new management
endpoints is Ordering.


319
00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:54.935 line:-2 align:center
Let's say you get a request
to reassign some assets


320
00:13:54.935 --> 00:13:57.304 line:-2 align:center
from one group
of users to another.


321
00:13:57.304 --> 00:13:59.873 line:-2 align:center
This can be achieved
by you sequentially firing off


322
00:13:59.873 --> 00:14:03.477 line:-2 align:center
a disassociate followed
by an associate request.


323
00:14:03.477 --> 00:14:06.146 line:-2 align:center
First, you post
the disassociate request.


324
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,248 line:-2
Apple then responds
with the event ID


325
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,717 line:-1
for the disassociate.


326
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,754 line:-2
Then, you post the subsequent
associate request.


327
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:15,956 line:-2
Apple responds
with another event ID,


328

but this time,
for the associate.

00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,828 line:-2
Apple will post notifications
to you


331
00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.797 line:-1 align:center
as the disassociations complete.


332
00:14:23.797 --> 00:14:25.966 line:-2 align:center
Then, Apple will post
notifications to you


333
00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:28.268 line:-1 align:center
as the associations complete.


334
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,671 line:-2
Big changes to our API,
like notifications,


335
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,473 line:-2
allow you to keep your state
in-sync with Apple,


336
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,742 line:-2
removing the need
to continually make requests


337
00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:37.544 line:-2 align:center
to ensure you have
the latest state.


338
00:14:38.846 --> 00:14:40.447 line:-1 align:center
Asynchronous processing allows


339
00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:42.316 line:-2 align:center
for everyone to have
a better experience,


340
00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:44.184 line:-2 align:center

341
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,086 line:-2

344
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:57,264 line:-2
The legacy API will continue
to be supported at this time.


345
00:14:57.264 --> 00:15:00.000 line:-2 align:center
Note that using the new
and legacy API versions


346
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.835 line:-2 align:center
in conjunction
for the same token


347
00:15:01.835 --> 00:15:03.871 line:-2 align:center
will not be
officially supported.


348
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,708 line:-1
This new API is the way forward


349
00:15:07.708 --> 00:15:10.410 line:-2 align:center
for Apps and Books Management
and is available today.


350
