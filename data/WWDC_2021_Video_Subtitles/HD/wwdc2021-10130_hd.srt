[Graham]
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,414 line:-2
My name is Graham, and I'm here
with my colleague, Nadia,


5
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,617 line:-2
and we're from the Device
Management team here at Apple.


6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,386 line:-2
This past year has seen
unprecedented changes


7
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,155 line:-2
in the way we work, live,
and learn.


8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,391 line:-2
From the office
to the kitchen table


9
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,026 line:-1
to the living room sofa,


10
00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:28.395 line:-2 align:center
Apple hardware, software,
and services


11
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,230 line:-2
have been there
to give people the power


12
00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.933 line:-2 align:center
and flexibility to do
whatever needs doing.


13
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,335 line:-2
Apple platforms provide
a huge opportunity


14
00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:36.570 line:-1 align:center
for system administrators


15
00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.405 line:-2 align:center
and mobile device
management developers


16
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,207 line:-2
to deliver
incredible apps,


17
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.476 line:-2 align:center
rich content,
and powerful services


18
00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:46.113 line:-2 align:center
to customers, employees,
students, and teachers.


19
00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.148 line:-2 align:center
At Apple,
we believe that the balance


20
00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:51.852 line:-2 align:center
between privacy, user agency,
and administrative control


21
00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.389 line:-2 align:center
is what makes for a great
device management solution.


22
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,991 line:-2
And in iOS 15 and macOS
Monterey,


23
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,626 line:-2
we're introducing
a number of great new features


24
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,828 line:-1
across all of our platforms.


25
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,931 line:-2
With so many exciting
new features to share,


26
00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:06.567 line:-2 align:center
we've created deep dive
sessions for many of them.


27
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.368 line:-2 align:center
I'd like to briefly touch
on a few topics


28
00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:10.404 line:-2 align:center
before we get
into today's content,


29
00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:13.540 line:-2 align:center
starting with changes
to user enrollment.


30
00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:14.842 line:-1 align:center
User enrollment is designed


31
00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:16.476 line:-2 align:center
for Bring Your Own Device
deployments,


32
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,247 line:-2
where the user and not the
organization owns the device.


33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,516 line:-2
This MDM enrollment type
protects the privacy


34
00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.651 line:-2 align:center
of personal data
while still securing


35
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,553 line:-1
corporate data on the device.


36
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,322 line:-2
This year, we have some
exciting improvements


37
00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.257 line:-2 align:center
to data separation
and user onboarding.


38
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,926 line:0
Check out the "Discover
account-driven user enrollment"


39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,628 line:0
session to learn more.


40
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:38,098 line:-2
Next, I'm very excited to share
with you that Apple Configurator


41
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.334 line:-2 align:center
for iPhone is coming
to the App Store,


42
00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:41.535 line:-1 align:center
and we have a new feature


43
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,637 line:-2
for macOS
automated device enrollment.


44
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,372 align:center
You are not going to want
to miss


45
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,475 align:center
the "Manage devices with Apple
configurator" session.


46
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,477 line:-2
We're enhancing the device
management protocol


47
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:52.379 line:-2 align:center
to be more
robust and performant.


48
00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:54.314 line:-2 align:center
For a look into the future
of MDM,


49
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:57,651 align:center
check out the "Meet declarative
device management" session.


50
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,353 align:center
This year,
we have a number of exciting


51
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:03,724 line:0
software update changes for iOS,
iPadOS, and macOS.


52
00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:06.126 line:-2 align:center
See what's new in the
"Manage software updates


53
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.761 line:-1 align:center
in your organization" session,


54
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,630 line:-2
where we'll discuss testing,
deploying,


55
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,331 line:-1
and enforcing OS updates.


56
00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:13.433 line:-2 align:center
Now I'd like to turn
it over to my colleague, Nadia,


57
00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.469 line:-2 align:center
to tell you about
some very exciting new features


58
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,305 line:-2
coming to iOS
and iPadOS 15 this year.


59
00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:22.409 line:-2 align:center
[Nadia] Hi, I'm excited to tell
you about all the new


60
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:26,680 line:-2
iOS and iPadOS features
for device management.


61
00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:29.316 line:-2 align:center
This year,
we've made a significant change


62
00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.785 line:-2 align:center
to the way users view their
managed account,


63
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,554 line:-2
the profiles
installed on the device,


64
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,856 line:-2
and how VPN is configured
in Settings.


65
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,195 line:-2
VPN & Device Management
have been combined together,


66
00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.297 line:-2 align:center
providing
one comprehensive place


67
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.465 line:-1 align:center
to display the device state.


68
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,568 line:-2
There, you can get
a complete understanding


69
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:51.171 line:-2 align:center
of how your device
is being managed.


70
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:54,274 line:-2
Another key component
of MDM is installing apps.


71
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,611 line:-2
Many MDM vendors have an agent
app that they require


72
00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:59.813 line:-1 align:center
as part of configuring devices,


73
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,449 line:-2
or perhaps an organization
has a critical app


74
00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.318 line:-1 align:center
all their employees need.


75
00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.987 line:-2 align:center
On supervised devices,
this isn't a problem


76
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,024 line:-2
because apps install
without prompting the user.


77
00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:14.361 line:-2 align:center
However, unsupervised devices
prompt for permission


78
00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:18.498 line:-2 align:center
to install apps, which
the user could then decline.


79
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,935 line:-2
Wouldn't it be great if you
had more control over this?


80
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,005 line:-1
Well, now you do.


81
00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.441 line:-1 align:center
Introducing Required App.


82
00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:30.744 line:-2 align:center
You can now specify one app that
you would like to be installed


83
00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.646 line:-1 align:center
on unsupervised devices.


84
00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.682 line:-2 align:center
We ensure user privacy
is protected,


85
00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.385 line:-2 align:center
since the user
is consenting to the app install


86
00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.087 line:-1 align:center
during MDM enrollment,


87
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.688 line:-2 align:center
and only this app
will install


88
00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.824 line:-2 align:center
without additional
user approval.


89
00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:47.227 line:-2 align:center
Simply add the iTunes Store ID
of the App Store application


90
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:49.730 line:-1 align:center
to the MDM profile.


91
00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:52.933 line:-2 align:center
Then ensure your app has
a device or user license


92
00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:55.636 line:-2 align:center
and send the InstallApplication
command.


93
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,971 line:-2
Also make sure to add
a managed app attribute


94
00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:01.275 line:-2 align:center
to ensure the user
cannot remove your app.


95
00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:03.210 line:-2 align:center
Securing the flow of data
between apps


96
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,613 line:-2
is also a really
important consideration.


97
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,449 line:-2
Managed open-in allows you
to control whether data


98
00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:12.486 line:-2 align:center
is allowed to enter or leave
the management sphere.


99
00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.056 line:-2 align:center
At its most basic, it controls
independently whether data can


100
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,691 line:-2
can be sent
from an unmanaged app


101
00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:20.260 line:-2 align:center
to a managed app
and vice versa.


102
00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:22.896 line:-2 align:center
And now we're making
it better than ever


103
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,199 line:-1
with managed pasteboard.


104
00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.770 line:-2 align:center
A new restriction called
requireManagedPasteboard


105
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:34,575 line:-2
controls whether copy/paste is
affected by managed open-in.


106
00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.810 line:-2 align:center
System apps that will
honor the restriction


107
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:40,914 line:-2
include Calendar,
Notes, Mail, and Files.


108
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,550 line:-2
All other apps require
no additional changes


109
00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:46.720 line:-1 align:center
to adopt this feature.


110
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,423 line:-2
Like usual,
apps installed via MDM


111
00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.658 line:-2 align:center
will automatically be
treated as managed,


112
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:55,863 line:-2
and apps installed by the user
will be treated as unmanaged.


113
00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:58.365 line:-2 align:center
With managed pasteboard,
you'll always be allowed


114
00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.267 line:-1 align:center
to see the paste button.


115
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,102 line:-2
If you're not allowed
to paste content somewhere


116
00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.171 line:-2 align:center
due to the restriction,
you'll get


117
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,740 line:-2
a "Paste Not Allowed"
notification.


118
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,243 line:-2
As a side note,
the organization name


119
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:12,246 line:-2
that appears in the notification
can be modified using


120
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,349 line:-2
the OrganizationInfo Settings
command.


121
00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:18.218 line:-2 align:center
Last year, we brought Shared
iPad to Business,


122
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:21,021 line:-2
which allows employees to have
a personal experience


123
00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:22.923 line:-1 align:center
on a shared device.


124
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,058 line:-2
Shared iPad has traditionally
required


125
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:28,495 line:-1
the use of a Managed Apple ID,


126
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,165 line:-2
but with Temporary Session,
anyone can use a shared iPad.


127
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,003 line:-2
When logging out, all data,
such as Safari browsing history,


128
00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:38.939 line:-2 align:center
modified user settings,
and files added


129
00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:40.774 line:-1 align:center
will be deleted from the device,


130
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,610 line:-2
leaving it
ready for the next user.


131
00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:47.614 line:-2 align:center
In iOS 14.5, we have introduced
three new features


132
00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:52.019 line:-2 align:center
in the SharedDeviceConfiguration
Settings command.


133
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,455 line:-2
TemporarySessionOnly is
to limit the ability to log in


134
00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:57.824 line:-1 align:center
with a Managed Apple ID.


135
00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.861 line:-2 align:center
TemporarySessionTimeout
and UserSessionTimeout


136
00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:04.665 line:-2 align:center
will automatically log the user
out after a set amount of time,


137
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,834 line:-2
ensuring that your data
is secure


138
00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:09.703 line:-1 align:center
after a period of inactivity.


139
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,639 line:-2
Make sure to not set
the timer to a value too short,


140
00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:15.409 line:-2 align:center
and also pressing the power
or Home button


141
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,945 line:-2
will cause
the timer to reset.


142
00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:19.446 line:-2 align:center
Now let's talk about
some changes


143
00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.249 line:-1 align:center
we've added for Apple TV.


144
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,185 line:-2
The TV Remote payload
is useful for connecting


145
00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:28.021 line:-2 align:center
specific Apple TVs
with the Remote widget


146
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,793 line:-2
in Control Center on iOS
and iPadOS devices.


147
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,530 line:-2
In tvOS 15, there is a new
security enhancement


148
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,765 line:-2
where Apple TV
will no longer broadcast


149
00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:40.868 line:-1 align:center
Mac addresses over Bonjour.


150
00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:43.570 line:-2 align:center
Due to this change,
we can no longer prevent


151
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:46,273 line:-2
PIN prompts
from appearing on the TV.


152
00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:49.276 line:-2 align:center
To ensure minimal impact
to your deployments,


153
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:53,080 line:-2
we've added a new key
to the TV Remote payload.


154
00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:58.585 line:-2 align:center
Use the new TVDeviceName key
in addition to the TVDeviceID key


155
00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:02.422 line:-2 align:center
to filter Apple TV device
names in the Remote widget.


156
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,892 line:-2
This will prevent any
unwanted pairing attempts


157
00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:07.461 line:-1 align:center
from managed devices.


158
00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:10.364 line:-2 align:center
A few other changes
you will want to be aware of:


159
00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:12.766 line:-2 align:center
all payload types
within a single profile


160
00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:15.169 line:-2 align:center
require unique
payload identifiers.


161
00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:17.638 line:-2 align:center
Additionally
for unsupervised devices,


162
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,439 line:-2
the Take Management
prompt for apps


163
00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:21.575 line:-2 align:center
can be declined
up to three times.


164
00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:25.179 line:-2 align:center
After that, the device will
not prompt for 24 hours.


165
00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:27.748 line:-2 align:center
Also, we've updated a number
of payload keys


166
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.917 line:-1 align:center
to use more inclusive language.


167
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.219 line:-2 align:center
Be sure to check out
the updated Device Management


168
00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:34.555 line:-2 align:center
documentation
for more information.


169
00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:38.225 line:-2 align:center
Thanks for exploring
all the incredible features


170
00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:40.661 line:-1 align:center
with iOS and iPadOS 15.


171
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,496 line:-2
Now I'm going to hand
it back to Graham to talk


172
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:45.365 line:-2 align:center
about all the great new
features coming to the Mac.


173
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,867 line:-1
[Graham] Thank you, Nadia.


174
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.436 line:-2 align:center
I think you'll agree that 2020
was a very exciting year for the Mac,


175
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,605 line:-2
from the amazing new look and feel


176
00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:55.342 line:-2 align:center
of Big Sur to the introduction
of Apple silicon.


177
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:57.711 line:-2 align:center
This new generation of Mac
is enabling our users


178
00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.980 line:-2 align:center
to do all
kinds of amazing new things.


179
00:08:00.013 --> 00:08:02.149 line:-2 align:center
And we have some great
new device management features


180
00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:03.817 line:-1 align:center
in macOS Monterey.


181
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,353 line:-2
Let's get started by
talking about System Extensions.


182
00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:08.021 line:-2 align:center
System Extensions
allow for software


183
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,657 line:-2
like network extensions
and endpoint security solutions


184
00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:12.392 line:-2 align:center
to extend the functionality
of macOS


185
00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:15.095 line:-2 align:center
without requiring
kernel-level access.


186
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,431 line:-2
We've made a few changes
to the System Extension payload


187
00:08:17.464 --> 00:08:19.099 line:-2 align:center
to enhance
the management experience.


188
00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:22.970 line:-2 align:center
In macOS 11.3, installing
the System Extension payload


189
00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.938 line:-2 align:center
changes the state
of a system extension.


190
00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.807 line:-2 align:center
For example,
if a system extension


191
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,275 line:-1
is pending user approval,


192
00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:30.944 line:-2 align:center
installing the payload
will activate the extension.


193
00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:32.713 line:-2 align:center
Conversely,
removing the payload will now


194
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,681 line:-2
deactivate
the system extension.


195
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,317 line:-2
In macOS Monterey,
there is a new feature


196
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,453 line:-1
called RemovableSystemExtension.


197
00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:41.255 line:-2 align:center
This will allow an app
to deactivate


198
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,890 line:-1
its own system extension,


199
00:08:42.923 --> 00:08:45.826 line:-2 align:center
for example,
when the app uninstalls itself.


200
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,962 line:-2
With this feature, there will be
no admin password required


201
00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:50.898 line:-1 align:center
to remove the system extension.


202
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,499 line:-2
This may
be useful in deployments


203
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,035 line:-1
where the Mac has no admin user.


204
00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:57.404 line:-2 align:center
In macOS Big Sur,
it became a requirement


205
00:08:57.437 --> 00:09:00.140 line:-2 align:center
to reboot a Mac to modify
kernel extensions.


206
00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:01.909 line:-2 align:center
We've added
a few features to make


207
00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:03.944 line:-2 align:center
managing kernel
extensions easier.


208
00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:07.314 line:-2 align:center
First, we added an option
to the RestartDevice command


209
00:09:07.347 --> 00:09:08.782 line:-1 align:center
that tells the Mac to rebuild


210
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,918 line:-2
its kernel extension cache
on reboot.


211
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,086 line:-2
This is required anytime
a kernel extension


212
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.022 line:-1 align:center
is added or removed.


213
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,492 line:-2
Use the optional KextPaths
key to specify kernel extensions


214
00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:20.861 line:-2 align:center
that haven't been discovered
by the operating system.


215
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.030 line:-2 align:center
This allows
MDM to install an app


216
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,499 line:-2
and load the kernel
extension without requiring


217
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,968 line:-2
the user to launch
the app before rebooting.


218
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,637 line:-2
The new NotifyUser
option will allow MDM


219
00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:33.006 line:-2 align:center
to display a reboot
notification to the user.


220
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.675 line:-2 align:center
When clicked,
the user can perform


221
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,743 line:-1
a graceful restart of the Mac.


222
00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:38.745 line:-2 align:center
The NotifyUser feature
can be used outside


223
00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:40.581 line:-2 align:center
of the context of kernel
extensions,


224
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:43,116 line:-2
but it's especially helpful
when they're combined.


225
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,319 line:-2
The AllowNonAdminUserApprovals
key


226
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,855 line:-2
in the System Policy
Kernel Extensions payload


227
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,257 line:-2
allows a standard user
to complete the installation


228
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,825 line:-1
of kernel extensions.


229
00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:55.128 line:-2 align:center
Note the user must
perform the restart from within


230
00:09:55.162 --> 00:09:57.798 line:-2 align:center
System Preferences
or use the notification


231
00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:01.535 line:-2 align:center
from MDM to trigger
the kernel cache rebuild.


232
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,204 line:-2
Depending on the hardware,
you may need a bootstrap token


233
00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:05.606 line:-1 align:center
to complete this step.


234
00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:07.174 line:-2 align:center
You can find out
if this is required


235
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,276 line:-1
in the SecurityInfo query.


236
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,812 line:-1
Next, let's talk about apps.


237
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,281 line:-2
One of the coolest new features
of Mac computers


238
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,451 line:-2
with Apple silicon
is the ability to run iPhone


239
00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:19.453 line:-1 align:center
and iPad apps.


240
00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:21.788 line:-2 align:center
With the initial launch
of macOS Big Sur,


241
00:10:21.822 --> 00:10:24.358 line:-2 align:center
we added a new DeviceInformation
query key


242
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:26.193 line:-2 align:center
that reports if a Mac
supports iPhone


243
00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:27.861 line:-1 align:center
and iPad app installs,


244
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:33,467 line:-2
and in macOS 11.3 on Apple
silicon, this now returns true.


245
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,769 line:-2
Once you're ready to install
an App Store app


246
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,571 line:-2
or your own
in-house enterprise app,


247
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,039 line:-2
you'll need to include
a new flag


248
00:10:39.072 --> 00:10:40.707 line:-2 align:center
in the InstallApplication
command


249
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,544 line:-2
to indicate that it's an iPhone
or iPad app.


250
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,546 line:-2
And in the case
of in-house enterprise apps,


251
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:49,449 line:-2
ensure the URL in the manifest
points directly to an .ipa file


252
00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:51.118 line:-1 align:center
and not a. pkg.


253
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,886 align:center
We now support the ability
to manage


254
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,922 line:0
iOS-style
provisioning profiles.


255
00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:56.990 line:-2 align:center
This feature allows
for independent management


256
00:10:57.024 --> 00:10:59.760 line:-2 align:center
of in-house enterprise apps
and provisioning profiles.


257
00:10:59.793 --> 00:11:01.962 line:-2 align:center
Now, let's talk about
some new features


258
00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.697 line:-1 align:center
exclusive to Apple silicon.


259
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,599 line:-2
We are enhancing
the DeviceLock command


260
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,135 line:-2
on Mac computers
with Apple silicon.


261
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,071 line:-2
With this change, administrators
will now be able to send


262
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:15,175 line:-2
a six-digit PIN, message,
and phone number to the device.


263
00:11:15.209 --> 00:11:17.644 line:-2 align:center
This will cause the Mac
to reboot and present the user


264
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,279 line:-1
with the information provided,


265
00:11:19.313 --> 00:11:22.349 line:-2 align:center
bringing feature parity
across all Mac models.


266
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,419 line:-2
With remote lock in place,
the user is unable to use


267
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,521 line:-2
a Mac until the PIN
has been provided.


268
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,723 line:-2
Once the PIN is entered,
the Mac will reboot


269
00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:32.826 line:-2 align:center
with all data intact
ready for login.


270
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,461 line:-1
While this is a great start,


271
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,664 line:-2
rebooting to recovery could
allow for unintended data access


272
00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:39.833 line:-2 align:center
or changing critical
security settings.


273
00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:43.470 line:-2 align:center
So we're adding a new feature
to set a recovery password.


274
00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:44.972 line:-1 align:center
The new SetRecoveryLock


275
00:11:45.005 --> 00:11:47.641 line:-2 align:center
and VerifyRecoveryLock
MDM commands


276
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,043 line:-2
allow you to set
and verify a password


277
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,678 line:-2
that must be entered
before the Mac


278
00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:53.814 line:-1 align:center
can reboot into recovery.


279
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,782 line:-2
There are some important details
that you will want to know


280
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,851 line:-1
about using these new commands.


281
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:01,088 line:-2
The password can only
be set and removed by MDM.


282
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,524 line:-2
Therefore,
if a user un-enrolls from MDM,


283
00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:06.527 line:-2 align:center
the recovery password
will be removed.


284
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,530 line:-2
The MDM server needs
to know the existing password


285
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,899 line:-1
to set a new password.


286
00:12:11.932 --> 00:12:14.468 line:-2 align:center
And finally,
both the DeviceLock PIN


287
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,004 line:-2
and the Recovery Password
will be removed


288
00:12:17.037 --> 00:12:18.405 line:-1 align:center
when the Mac is erased.


289
00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:20.507 line:-2 align:center
Therefore, we recommend using
these features


290
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,409 line:-2
in conjunction
with Activation Lock


291
00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:25.078 line:-2 align:center
to provide the best
security for your fleet.


292
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,281 line:-2
Now, we know you're pretty
excited about these features,


293
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,550 line:-1
but we do have one last thing.


294
00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:32.252 line:-2 align:center
Erase All Content and Settings
for the Mac.


295
00:12:32.286 --> 00:12:35.956 line:-2 align:center
New in macOS Monterey is
the ability to Erase All Content


296
00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:38.659 line:-2 align:center
and Settings
for a quick return to service.


297
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,594 line:-2
And we're very excited
that this functionality


298
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,664 line:-2
will be available
via MDM as well.


299
00:12:43.697 --> 00:12:45.866 line:-2 align:center
Sending the EraseDevice
command will now erase


300
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,869 line:-2
all user data and reboot
back to Setup Assistant,


301
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,038 line:-1
ready for the next user.


302
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,439 line:-2
A couple of notes
on this feature


303
00:12:52.472 --> 00:12:54.408 line:-1 align:center
you'll want to be aware of:


304
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:59,479 line:-2
This feature is supported on Mac
computers with Apple silicon


305
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:03,283 line:-1
and the Apple T2 security chip.


306
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,252 line:-2
If the Mac
has multiple partitions,


307
00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:08.255 line:-2 align:center
it will reboot back to setup
on the current system volume,


308
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,725 line:-2
and all other volumes
will be erased.


309
00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:14.494 line:-2 align:center
On devices with Apple silicon,
this will also reset


310
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,831 line:-2
any security settings that have
been modified in recovery.


311
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,634 line:-2
We also know that you might not
want users to erase their Mac,


312
00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:23.136 line:-2 align:center
so we're bringing
the allowEraseContentAndSettings


313
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.873 line:-1 align:center
restriction to the Mac.


314
00:13:25.906 --> 00:13:28.075 line:-2 align:center
We've covered
a ton of new features today,


315
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,744 line:-2
and we're so excited for you
to get your hands on them.


316
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,447 line:-2
To keep up to date with the
latest changes in each seed,


317
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,549 line:-2
please review the Device
Management documentation


318
00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:38.185 line:-1 align:center
at developer.apple.com.


319
00:13:38.218 --> 00:13:40.287 line:-2 align:center
Also remember,
