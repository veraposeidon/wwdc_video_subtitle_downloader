00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.512 line:-2
[Will] Hello, and welcome
to "Meet In-App Events


5
00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:12.779 line:-1
on the App Store."


6
00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:13.881 line:-1
My name is Will Averill,


7
00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:17.618 line:-2
and I'm an engineering manager
on the App Store Connect team.


8
00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:19.820 line:-2
The App Store
is more than a store.


9
00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.489 line:-2
It's a daily destination
designed to help users discover


10
00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:25.058 line:-2
all the rich experiences
that apps have to offer.


11
00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.594 line:-2
So they can find
their next favorite app


12
00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:30.430 line:-2
or get the most out of the ones
they already have.


13
00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:35.135 line:-2
This fall, we're taking this
even further with In-App Events.


14
00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:38.505 line:-2
In-App Events are timely events
within your apps and games,


15
00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.107 line:-1
such as a game competition,


16
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.111 line:-2
a fitness challenge,
a movie premiere, and more.


17
00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.046 line:-2
In fact,
some of you may already be


18
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.714 line:-1
running events inside your apps.


19
00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:49.483 line:-1
For those of you who aren't,


20
00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.186 line:-2
now is a great time
to consider doing so.


21
00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.521 line:-2
That's because this fall,
In-App Events will be


22
00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.391 line:-2
discoverable
right on the App Store.


23
00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.626 line:-2
This a whole new way
to showcase your app's events


24
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.595 line:-1
and expand their reach.


25
00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:02.896 line:-1
In this session, I'll show you


26
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.932 line:-2
how In-App Events work
on the App Store


27
00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:07.534 line:-2
and how to create them
in App Store Connect.


28
00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.571 line:-2
In-App Events
appear on the App Store


29
00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:12.606 line:-1
in the new event card.


30
00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.108 line:-2
The design is focused
on letting your content come


31
00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:19.012 line:-2
front and center and supports
either an image or a video.


32
00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:21.381 line:-2
The event card also
displays your event name,


33
00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:22.883 line:-1
a short description,


34
00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.185 line:-2
and a time indicator,
which automatically updates


35
00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.821 line:-2
as the event approaches
and once it starts.


36
00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:30.123 line:-2
Users who have your app
installed will be able


37
00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:33.160 line:-2
to jump right into the event
by tapping Open.


38
00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:35.929 line:-2
This event card is discoverable
across the App Store,


39
00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:38.966 line:-2
beginning with
your product page.


40
00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.235 line:-2
Here, on your app's
product page,


41
00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:44.938 line:-2
events are listed in order
of their start and priority.


42
00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:47.140 line:-2
Their location
on the product page varies,


43
00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:49.176 line:-2
with events appearing
above screenshots


44
00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.744 line:-2
for users who have
downloaded your app,


45
00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:54.214 line:-2
and below screenshots
for those who haven't.


46
00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:57.651 line:-2
Tapping the event card brings up
the event details page.


47
00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:00.254 line:-2
The event details page,
with its longer description


48
00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:02.523 line:-2
and larger media asset,
gives users


49
00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:05.259 line:-2
additional context
around your event.


50
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.761 line:-2
You can also link directly
to your event details page


51
00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:11.832 line:-2
by appending the unique event ID
to your app's App Store URL.


52
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.502 line:-2
In order to build anticipation
for events,


53
00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:16.570 line:-1
you'll be able to promote them


54
00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.739 line:-2
up to two weeks
before they start.


55
00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.841 line:-2
And users will be able
to easily request


56
00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:23.510 line:-2
a notification
for when your event begins.


57
00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:26.013 line:-2
These notifications come
from the App Store


58
00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:29.349 line:-2
and will launch users directly
into the event inside your app.


59
00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:31.385 line:-2
If the user doesn't have
your app installed,


60
00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:33.654 line:-2
they will be directed
to the event details page.


61
00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:38.325 line:-2
In-App Events are also
discoverable through search.


62
00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:41.061 line:-2
Users who search for your app
will see the event card


63
00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.830 line:-2
along with the app
if they've downloaded it before.


64
00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:45.899 line:-2
For those users who haven't
downloaded your app,


65
00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:49.236 line:-2
they will instead see
screenshots alongside your app.


66
00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.005 line:-2
When users search directly
for your In-App Event,


67
00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.843 line:-2
the event card always appears
next to your app.


68
00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:59.179 line:-2
On the Games and Apps tabs,
users will see personalized


69
00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:01.515 line:-2
event recommendations
that can help them stay informed


70
00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.450 line:-2
about the apps and games
they already have,


71
00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:07.855 line:-2
find something new,
or rediscover an old favorite.


72
00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:10.190 line:-2
And lastly,
our editorial team will be


73
00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:12.626 line:-2
curating the most
exciting and innovative events


74
00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.663 line:-2
on the Today, Games,
and Apps tabs.


75
00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:21.034 line:-2
In-App Events will be
available on iOS and iPadOS.


76
00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:22.736 line:-2
Now that you've seen
what In-App Events look like


77
00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.471 line:-2
on the App Store,
let me show you


78
00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:26.840 line:-2
how to create an event
in App Store Connect.


79
00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.844 line:-2
Start by logging in
and navigating


80
00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:34.114 line:-2
to the app you wanna create
an event for.


81
00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:36.717 line:-2
Then click the new
In-App Events option


82
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.953 line:-1
under Features on the left.


83
00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:43.690 line:-2
This takes you to a high-level
overview of your app's events.


84
00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:45.359 line:-2
Since you're creating
your first event,


85
00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.361 line:-2
there's not much here
at the moment.


86
00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.396 line:-2
So click
the "Create In-App Event"


87
00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:50.831 line:-1
to begin the process.


88
00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.334 line:-2
You're then asked
to provide a Reference Name


89
00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:56.270 line:-1
for your new event.


90
00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:58.372 line:-2
Your event's reference name
is only visible


91
00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:01.441 line:-1
within App Store Connect.


92
00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:04.077 line:-2
Pick a reference name
up to 64 characters long


93
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:06.146 line:-1
and click Create.


94
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.483 line:-2
With your event now created,
you land on the event page.


95
00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:11.919 line:-2
Here, you'll provide
all the information necessary


96
00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:14.821 line:-2
to publish your In-App Event
to the App Store.


97
00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:17.457 line:-2
You'll start by filling in some
of the most fundamental metadata


98
00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:21.562 line:-2
about your event under
the Event Information section.


99
00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:25.132 line:-2
All fields under
Event Information are localized.


100
00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:27.167 line:-2
Click the current language
for a drop-down


101
00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.837 line:-1
of all available localizations.


102
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.039 line:-2
You should consider broadening
your event's audience


103
00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:36.343 line:-2
by localizing for as many
languages as possible.


104
00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:38.512 line:-2
Once you've selected
your intended language,


105
00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:40.714 line:-2
you'll need to pick
an event name.


106
00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:42.749 line:-2
This name has a limit
of 30 characters


107
00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:46.086 line:-2
and will appear
throughout the App Store.


108
00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.754 line:-2
I'll also point out
that as you fill in


109
00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:50.357 line:-2
the fields on the left,
those values are rendered


110
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.726 line:-2
in the preview window
on the right.


111
00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.128 line:-2
The preview window shows
both the event card


112
00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:59.032 line:-2
and event details page as they
will appear on the App Store.


113
00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:00.567 line:-2
From looking
at the preview window,


114
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:03.070 line:-2
you can see that the event name
is shown on both.


115
00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:07.975 line:-2
The short description is used
on the event card and is used


116
00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:11.044 line:-2
to briefly summarize your event
with up to 50 characters.


117
00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.915 line:-2
As the name suggests,
the event card media


118
00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:18.986 line:-2
is the image or video
that appears on your event card.


119
00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:20.487 line:-1
While the long description


120
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:23.023 line:-2
is used
on the event details page.


121
00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.292 line:-1
This has a 120-character limit,


122
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.194 line:-2
so you can include
additional details,


123
00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:29.129 line:-2
like potential rewards,
for example.


124
00:05:30.898 --> 00:05:33.200 line:-2
Next, you'll add
either an image or video


125
00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:35.702 line:-1
for the event details page.


126
00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:38.372 line:-2
Videos you use on both
the card and details page


127
00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.908 line:-2
will loop and are limited
to 30 seconds.


128
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.545 line:-2
Lastly, pick
from the badge options


129
00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:47.047 line:-2
to define the type of event
you're running.


130
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.916 line:-2
This badge is
displayed on the card


131
00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.252 line:-2
and details views
on the App Store.


132
00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:54.421 line:-2
With your Event Information
now finished,


133
00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:57.191 line:-1
let's continue down the page.


134
00:05:57.224 --> 00:05:59.526 line:-2
Just like Apps
and In-App Purchases,


135
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.094 line:-2
you'll need
to define availability


136
00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:03.197 line:-2
for your In-App Event
on a per Country


137
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.832 line:-1
or Region basis.


138
00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:09.403 line:-2
Click the Edit button to open
the Country and Region selector,


139
00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:13.073 line:-2
something that should be
familiar to most of you.


140
00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.308 line:-1
The only difference here


141
00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:16.577 line:-2
is that your In-App Event
can only be made available


142
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.514 line:-2
in Countries where
your parent app is available.


143
00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:23.817 line:-2
After deciding availability,
you need to schedule your event,


144
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:28.021 line:-2
which means defining its start,
end, and publish date and times.


145
00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:31.959 line:-2
Event start represents
when your event begins


146
00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:34.761 line:-1
inside your app.


147
00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:38.432 line:-2
You'll also need to define when
the event ends inside your app.


148
00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:40.534 line:-2
Together,
the start and end represent


149
00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.370 line:-2
the total duration
of your In-App Event.


150
00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.672 line:-2
Your event can run
as long as 31 days


151
00:06:45.706 --> 00:06:48.308 line:-1
or as short as 15 minutes.


152
00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:50.244 line:-2
The next thing you'll need
to consider is when you want


153
00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:54.081 line:-2
your event to first appear
on the App Store.


154
00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:56.617 line:-2
This is controlled
by your event's publish date,


155
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.586 line:-2
which can be up to 14 days
from your event's start.


156
00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:03.457 line:-2
When your event is published
to the App Store, it will be


157
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.159 line:-2
discoverable through all of
the ways we discussed earlier,


158
00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:08.996 line:-2
like on your product page
and in search.


159
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:12.499 line:-2
Once your event reaches its end,
it is no longer discoverable


160
00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:15.335 line:-2
on the App Store
by browsing or searching.


161
00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:19.006 line:-2
However, users will still
be able to see


162
00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.340 line:-1
your event details page


163
00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:23.477 line:-2
via the App Store URL
for another 30 days,


164
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.713 line:-2
after which point,
it is then archived.


165
00:07:26.747 --> 00:07:29.216 line:-2
This ensures links you've shared
through marketing channels


166
00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:32.619 line:-2
will still work for a while
after the event ends.


167
00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:34.721 line:-2
This 30-day period
happens automatically


168
00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:36.957 line:-1
and is not configurable.


169
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.059 line:-2
If you want to archive
your In-App Event sooner,


170
00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:41.395 line:-2
you're able to do so
by editing its availability


171
00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:43.130 line:-1
in App Store Connect.


172
00:07:44.965 --> 00:07:47.401 line:-2
Now that you've set up
your event's default scheduling,


173
00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:49.536 line:-2
you're given the ability
to set custom scheduling


174
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.605 line:-1
per Country or Region.


175
00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:53.674 line:-2
This is completely optional,
but to do so,


176
00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:57.010 line:-2
click the "Customize Dates
and Times" link.


177
00:07:57.044 --> 00:07:59.546 line:-2
First, select the Countries
or Regions you want to add


178
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.584 line:-2
custom scheduling for,
and then click Next.


179
00:08:03.617 --> 00:08:06.119 line:-2
Now, choose one or more
new scheduling dates


180
00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:09.056 line:-2
to apply to these
specific Countries.


181
00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:11.291 line:-2
The custom dates need to be
within 48 hours


182
00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:13.193 line:-1
of your default selections.


183
00:08:13.227 --> 00:08:15.529 line:-2
In this example, I've bumped
my start and end date


184
00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:17.965 line:-2
in Europe to account
for the time difference.


185
00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.467 line:-2
Lock in your custom scheduling
by clicking Done.


186
00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:23.937 line:-2
And with that,
you've just finished configuring


187
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:26.707 line:-2
your event's availability
and scheduling.


188
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.776 line:-2
There's only a few more
pieces of metadata to provide.


189
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.311 line:-2
This is done
in the final section


190
00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:34.848 line:-2
of the page,
Additional Information.


191
00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:36.783 line:-2
First, you can edit
the Reference Name


192
00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:39.019 line:-1
that you chose earlier.


193
00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:42.623 line:-2
Next, you need to provide
an Event Deep Link.


194
00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:44.691 line:-2
This link makes it possible
for users


195
00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:46.360 line:-2
with your app installed
to quickly jump


196
00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:49.396 line:-2
from the App Store
into your In-App Event.


197
00:08:49.429 --> 00:08:51.965 line:-2
Your event deep link can
either be a universal link


198
00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:54.268 line:-2
or a custom URL
that opens directly


199
00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:56.570 line:-2
to a particular place
in your app.


200
00:08:56.603 --> 00:08:58.705 line:-2
In order for your link
to function correctly,


201
00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:01.441 line:-2
avoid using URL shorteners
or other services


202
00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:03.443 line:-1
that add unnecessary redirects.


203
00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.880 line:-1
With the Event Purpose field,


204
00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:08.615 line:-2
you can indicate
whether your event is meant


205
00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:12.119 line:-2
to attract new users,
keep your active users informed,


206
00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:14.955 line:-2
or bring lapsed users
back to your app.


207
00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:17.791 line:-2
Many events are equally
suited for all these purposes,


208
00:09:17.824 --> 00:09:20.294 line:-1
so that's the default selection.


209
00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:22.129 line:-2
Your selection here
is one of the factors


210
00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:25.866 line:-2
that the App Store uses to offer
personalized recommendations.


211
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.869 line:-2
To help your event reach
the people it's intended for,


212
00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:32.306 line:-2
the App Store incorporates
app-usage information.


213
00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:34.608 line:-2
That data is processed
on the device


214
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:38.278 line:-2
to minimize data collection
and enhance user privacy.


215
00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:40.981 line:-2
Note that regardless
of which purpose you select,


216
00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:43.917 line:-2
your event will be discoverable
by all App Store users.


217
00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:48.355 line:-2
Here you can indicate
your event's priority level,


218
00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:51.792 line:-2
which affects how it's ordered
on your app's product page.


219
00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:54.361 line:-2
High-priority events are shown
in front of normal ones,


220
00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:56.163 line:-2
and events are sorted
by their start time


221
00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:58.866 line:-1
within these respective groups.


222
00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:01.201 line:-2
Next, you'll indicate
whether your event requires


223
00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:03.203 line:-2
an In-App Purchase
or a Subscription.


224
00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:07.007 line:-2
This information is displayed
on your event card


225
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.142 line:-1
and event details page.


226
00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:11.278 line:-2
Make sure your selection here
is accurate to set


227
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:13.814 line:-2
proper expectation with users
and to ensure


228
00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:15.716 line:-1
a seamless review process.


229
00:10:17.017 --> 00:10:20.521 line:-2
And finally, you can update
your event's Primary Language.


230
00:10:20.554 --> 00:10:23.657 line:-2
By default, this is set
to your app's primary language.


231
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.294 line:-2
With that, you've now fully
configured your In-App Event.


232
00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.264 line:-2
Make sure you click
the Save button


233
00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:32.299 line:-2
to persist everything
you just filled out.


234
00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:36.203 line:-2
After saving,
you'll notice your In-App Event


235
00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:38.705 line:-1
is listed in the "draft" state.


236
00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:41.441 line:-2
Draft events are simply
any event that you've started,


237
00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:44.478 line:-2
but haven't yet added
for review.


238
00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:46.313 line:-2
To publish your event
to the App Store,


239
00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:48.649 line:-1
it must first be reviewed.


240
00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:51.585 line:-2
To add your event for review,
navigate back to the event page


241
00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:54.121 line:-2
and click the button
in the top right.


242
00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:56.056 line:-2
You'll be able to add
an event for review anytime


243
00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:58.559 line:-2
after you've filled in
all the required metadata.


244
00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:01.328 line:-2
There's no need to create
a new version of your app


245
00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:04.331 line:-1
or upload a new binary.


246
00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:06.967 line:-2
As you just saw,
events begin in the draft state


247
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.269 line:-2
and can be reviewed
once fully configured.


248
00:11:10.604 --> 00:11:14.608 line:-2
After they pass through review,
events enter the approved state.


249
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:17.144 line:-2
Once approved,
events automatically publish


250
00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:20.380 line:-2
to the App Store
according to their scheduling.


251
00:11:20.414 --> 00:11:22.349 line:-2
Approved events
with a future publish date


252
00:11:22.382 --> 00:11:24.751 line:-2
are labeled "Set to Publish,"
while those


253
00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:27.588 line:-2
with past publish dates
are marked "Published."


254
00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:30.991 line:-2
After an event's end date
is reached,


255
00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.861 line:-2
the event moves
to the "Past" state.


256
00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:35.796 line:-2
While no longer published
to the App Store,


257
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:37.965 line:-2
remember that your event
details page is still


258
00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:41.235 line:-2
link accessible on the App Store
for an additional 30 days.


259
00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:45.606 line:-2
And finally, after 30 days
in the "Past" state,


260
00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:48.442 line:-2
your In-App event moves
to its final state, Archived,


261
00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:50.811 line:-2
and is no longer
accessible via link.


262
00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:54.848 line:-2
Now that you understand
the event state life cycle,


263
00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:57.284 line:-2
let's discuss
two important limits.


264
00:11:57.317 --> 00:11:59.253 line:-2
First, your app can have
ten events


265
00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:01.788 line:-1
in the approved state.


266
00:12:01.822 --> 00:12:04.191 line:-2
And second,
your app can have five events


267
00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.960 line:-2
published to the App Store
at a time.


268
00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:08.662 line:-2
You won't be able to add
an event for review


269
00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:11.431 line:-2
if its scheduling would cause
either limit to be exceeded.


270
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.435 line:-2
After your events have been
published to the App Store,


271
00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:18.472 line:-2
it's important to measure
how they're performing.


272
00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:20.440 line:-2
So there's a robust
new set of capabilities


273
00:12:20.474 --> 00:12:22.910 line:-1
to do this in App Analytics.


274
00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:24.444 line:-2
Your event page
in App Store Connect


275
00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:27.481 line:-2
will link directly
to your event in App Analytics.


276
00:12:27.514 --> 00:12:29.583 line:-2
From there, you'll find
many important metrics


277
00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:32.052 line:-2
allowing you to measure
your event's effectiveness.


278
00:12:34.888 --> 00:12:37.324 line:-2
First, you'll be able to track
your impressions,


279
00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:41.028 line:-2
which shows how many people
saw your event on the App Store.


280
00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:42.863 line:-2
You'll also be able
to drill down further,


281
00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:44.765 line:-2
to figure out where users
saw your event,


282
00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:48.302 line:-2
like on your product page,
in search, or other locations.


283
00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:52.005 line:-2
Next, you'll see metrics
around how many users


284
00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:56.043 line:-2
opened your app or opened
the event details page.


285
00:12:56.076 --> 00:12:58.912 line:-2
In addition, you'll see
how many users downloaded


286
00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:02.749 line:-2
or redownloaded your app
as a result of your event.


287
00:13:02.783 --> 00:13:04.651 line:-2
And lastly,
you'll see how many users


288
00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:07.187 line:-2
enabled notifications
for your In-App Event.


289
00:13:08.956 --> 00:13:11.158 line:-2
There's additional insights
available in App Analytics


290
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,860
that I didn't cover,
so if you're interested


291
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,695
in learning more,
be sure to check out


292
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,364
the What's new
in App Analytics session.


293
00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:19.733 line:-2
And finally, we know
how important it is


294
00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:21.101 line:-2
for you as developers
to automate


295
00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:24.304 line:-2
as much of your app workflow
process as possible.


296
00:13:24.338 --> 00:13:26.306 line:-2
That's why
I'm pleased to announce,


297
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.709 line:-2
all the In-App Event
functionality I just discussed


298
00:13:28.742 --> 00:13:31.645 line:-2
will be supported
by the App Store Connect API.


299
00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:34.548 line:-2
The full spec will be
provided later this year.


300
00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:37.251 line:-2
I've covered a lot of
new information in this session.


301
00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:39.319 line:-2
First, I showed you
how users will discover


302
00:13:39.353 --> 00:13:41.522 line:-1
In-App Events on the App Store.


303
00:13:41.555 --> 00:13:43.624 line:-2
Next, I walked you through
how to set up


304
00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:46.193 line:-2
your In-App Events
in App Store Connect.


305
00:13:46.226 --> 00:13:47.928 line:-2
And finally,
we covered how you'll be able


306
00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:50.631 line:-2
to measure their performance
in App Analytics.


307
00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:52.699 line:-2
I can't wait to see
all of the exciting events


308
00:13:52.733 --> 00:13:56.103 line:-2
within your apps, now
discoverable on the App Store.


309
00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:58.405 line:-2
And I hope you start thinking
about how you can bring


310
00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:01.775 line:-2
In-App Events to your own apps
if you haven't already.


311
00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:04.811 line:-2
In-App Events launch
later this fall.


312
00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:05.946 line:-2
Thanks for watching
this session,


313
00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:07.948 line:-2
and please enjoy
the rest of your conference!


314
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,984
[upbeat music]
