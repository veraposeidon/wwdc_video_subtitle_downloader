[Dan]
My name is Dan Harris.

I'm a longtime --that's my way
of saying I'm old--

longtime correspondent
and anchorman


7
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,452 line:-1
with "ABC News."


8
00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.787 line:-2 align:center
I've worked at "ABC News"
for 21 years.


9
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:22.956 line:-2 align:center
And then about seven years ago,
I wrote a book


10
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.526 line:-2 align:center
called "Ten Percent Happier,"
which was about how


11
00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.363 line:-2 align:center
a skeptical journalist
came to embrace meditation.


12
00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:32.666 line:-2 align:center
For me, the whole thing
started with a panic attack,


13
00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.702 line:-2 align:center
a very public panic attack
on "Good Morning America."


14
00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:38.272 line:-2 align:center
Even more embarrassing
than having a panic attack


15
00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.808 line:-2 align:center
on national television was what
caused the panic attack.


16
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:44,811 line:-2
I think at the root
of that meltdown


17
00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:47.481 line:-1 align:center
was something that everybody


18
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:52,986 line:-2
who is part of this conference
has, which is ambition.


19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,390 line:-2
I arrived at "ABC News"
at the big leagues,


20
00:00:56.423 --> 00:01:00.260 line:-2 align:center
the network, at the tender age
of 28 years old,


21
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:04,731 line:-2
and I was really anxious
about being so young


22
00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:08.035 line:-2 align:center
and being so inexperienced,
and I just threw myself


23
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:13,273 line:-2
into my work in a really, really
sort of workaholic-style way.


24
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,776 line:-2
And shortly after
I arrived at "ABC News,"


25
00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:19.112 line:-2 align:center
there was a huge event
in the news, and that was 9/11.


26
00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:23.050 line:-2 align:center
And I kind of raised my hand
after 9/11 to volunteer


27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,652 line:-2
to go overseas to cover
whatever was gonna happen next,


28
00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.988 line:-2 align:center
and I spent many years
in war zones


29
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.357 line:-2 align:center
like Afghanistan and Israel,
the West Bank,


30
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,593 line:-1
Gaza, a lot of time in Iraq…


31
00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:36.997 line:-1 align:center
six or seven long stays in Iraq.


32
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.866 line:-2 align:center
And I came home
in the middle of this period,


33
00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.969 line:-2 align:center
and I got depressed,
although I didn't actually know


34
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.104 line:-2 align:center
I was depressed,
and I did something


35
00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.673 line:-2 align:center
extremely stupid at this point,
which is I started


36
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,309 line:-2
to self-medicate
with recreational drugs.


37
00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:52.312 line:-2 align:center
And even though my drug use,
primarily cocaine,


38
00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:56.350 line:-2 align:center
was pretty limited
and I was never high on the air,


39
00:01:56,383 --> 00:02:00,521 line:-2
after I went to--
after the panic attack,


40
00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:01.855 line:-1 align:center
I went to go see a doctor,


41
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,558 line:-2
and he asked me
a bunch of questions.


42
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,560 line:-2
And one of the questions
was, "Do you do drugs?"


43
00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.196 line:-2 align:center
And I kind of sheepishly
said, "Yeah, I do."


44
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,898 line:-1
And he gave me a look


45
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:14.635 line:-2 align:center
that indicated, "OK, moron.
Mystery solved."


46
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,737 line:-2
And he pointed out
that even though the drug use


47
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.705 line:-1 align:center
was somewhat unspectacular,


48
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,507 line:-2
it was enough
to change my brain chemistry


49
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:23.844 line:-2 align:center
and make it more likely
for me to freak out.


50
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,246 line:-2
So this was
a huge ‘Aha!’ moment for me,


51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,749 line:-2
and I decided to quit
doing drugs


52
00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:33.120 line:-2 align:center
and to go see this shrink once
or twice a week indefinitely.


53
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,790 line:-2
I started to poke around
and realized that there was


54
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:41,028 line:-2
a lot of evidence that suggested
that meditation


55
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.996 line:-2 align:center
was really good for you,
that it could lower


56
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.631 line:-2 align:center
your blood pressure,
boost your immune system,


57
00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:46.834 line:-2 align:center
literally rewire
key parts of your brain.


58
00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:48.769 line:-1 align:center
And there was at this time


59
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:52,506 line:-2
a not very well-publicized
body of research


60
00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.274 line:-2 align:center
that strongly suggested
that meditation


61
00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:56.944 line:-2 align:center
was really good for you,
so I started to try it,


62
00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:59.880 line:-2 align:center
and I started with, like,
five or ten minutes a day.


63
00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:02.449 line:-2 align:center
And I found that there
were really three main benefits.


64
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.687 line:-2 align:center
The first benefit
is that it made me calmer.


65
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.456 line:-2 align:center
Now, I want to be careful
about this word, "calm."


66
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,092 line:-2
Because some people sit
and meditate, and they expect


67
00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.595 line:-2 align:center
to feel calm immediately
and that if they don't,


68
00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:15.929 line:-2 align:center
they feel like
they're a failed meditator.


69
00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:17.431 line:-1 align:center
That's not quite how it works.


70
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,665 line:-2
Just because
you sit to meditate,


71
00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.736 line:-2 align:center
you are not necessarily
going to get calm lickety-split.


72
00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.872 line:-2 align:center
But the cumulative effect
of taking myself


73
00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:28.075 line:-2 align:center
out of the traffic
for five minutes every day


74
00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.511 line:-1 align:center
just injected my overall life


75
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,080 line:-2
with a little bit
more calm and sanity.


76
00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:35.916 line:-2 align:center
The second benefit
is that it helped me with focus.


77
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,053 line:-2
As you'll see in a minute,
meditation,


78
00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:43.490 line:-2 align:center
the practice of meditation
is generally where you just try


79
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,659 line:-2
to pick one thing
to pay attention to,


80
00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.227 line:-2 align:center
usually the feeling of
your breath coming in


81
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:49.029 line:-2 align:center
or going out,
and then every time


82
00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.531 line:-2 align:center
you get distracted,
you start again


83
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.332 line:-1 align:center
and again and again.


84
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,401 line:-2
And every time you do that,
it's like a bicep curl


85
00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:55.836 line:-1 align:center
for your brain.


86
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.105 line:-2 align:center
And this has been shown
on brain scans


87
00:03:58.138 --> 00:03:59.907 line:-1 align:center
to change the area of the brain


88
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,675 line:-2
associated
with attention regulation,


89
00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:05.112 line:-2 align:center
and I really found
that in my hectic life


90
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,915 line:-2
where I actually have
other people's voices


91
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:11,552 line:-2
piped directly into my head
as a news anchor,


92
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,420 line:-2
it really helped me…
meditation…


93
00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:15.656 line:-2 align:center
it really helped me
to stay on task.


94
00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.824 line:-2 align:center
The third benefit
is the most important one,


95
00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:20.127 line:-2 align:center
and it's a word
that is thrown around


96
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.128 line:-1 align:center
a lot these days.


97
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:23.130 line:-2 align:center
It's become
somewhat of a buzz phrase,


98
00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:25.666 line:-1 align:center
and it's mindfulness.


99
00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:30.370 line:-2 align:center
Mindfulness is,
just to put it very simply,


100
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,907 line:-2
it's the skill
that allows you to notice


101
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,309 line:-1
what's happening in your head


102
00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:39.046 line:-2 align:center
at any given moment without
getting carried away by it.


103
00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:40.480 line:-2 align:center
I'm just going to--I'm just
going to say that again


104
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,382 line:-2
because this is really
the most important point.


105
00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:44.818 line:-2 align:center
Mindfulness is the ability,
the kind of self-awareness


106
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,386 line:-2
that allows you to notice
what's happening


107
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.322 line:-2 align:center
in your body
and in your mind


108
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,123 line:-2
without necessarily
taking the bait


109
00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:51.558 line:-1 align:center
and acting on it.


110
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,494 line:-2
So, for example,
I would notice that I would be


111
00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:55.963 line:-2 align:center
in a conversation
with my wife,


112
00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:57.531 line:-1 align:center
maybe things weren't going well.


113
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,900 line:-2
I would notice, "Oh, yeah,
I'm starting to get angry,"


114
00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:01.468 line:-2 align:center
but I don't have
to say something


115
00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:04.171 line:-2 align:center
that's gonna ruin
the next 48 hours of my life.


116
00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:06.240 line:-1 align:center
Or maybe I'm bored or lonely


117
00:05:06.273 --> 00:05:08.775 line:-2 align:center
and I see a zombie arm
reaching into the cabinet


118
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.980 line:-2 align:center
and aiming to scarf
a sleeve of Oreos,


119
00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:15.949 line:-2 align:center
but I would notice the urge
and, instead of acting on it


120
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,887 line:-2
reflexively, I would be able
to respond wisely.


121
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,856 line:-2
And that was really--
it doesn't work all the time,


122
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,325 line:-2
which is why I call my book
"Ten Percent Happier,"


123
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,294 line:-2
but when it does work,
it's a game changer,


124
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,498 line:-2
and it is a skill that you
can improve over time.


125
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,468 line:-2
So as advertised
at the beginning


126
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,969 line:-2
of this talk,
I want to bring in somebody


127
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,605 line:-2
who's a genuine
meditation expert


128
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,507 line:-2
to talk a little bit more
about how we can apply


129
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:44.511 line:-2 align:center
these skills now
and how we can boot up a habit


130
00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:47.181 line:-2 align:center
because habit change
is often very, very tricky.


131
00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:50.584 line:-1 align:center
My friend's name is Jeff Warren.


132
00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:53.187 line:-2 align:center
He's a meditation teacher
based in Toronto.


133
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,589 line:-2
He and I wrote a book together
a few years ago


134
00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:57.724 line:-2 align:center
called "Meditation
for Fidgety Skeptics,”


135
00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:00.227 line:-2 align:center
and as part of that book,
we traveled


136
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,397 line:-2
all across the United States
of America in a bus.


137
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.232 line:-2 align:center
So let me just show you
a little clip of that


138
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,701 line:-2
and then I'll bring in Jeff
on the backside.

154
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,523 line:-2
I'm assuming--
you know, we wrote a book


155
00:07:02.556 --> 00:07:04.091 line:-2 align:center
called "Meditation
for Fidgety Skeptics."


156
00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:05.759 line:-2 align:center
I'm assuming
there are some fidgety skeptics


157
00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.862 line:-2 align:center

so, yes, I just said everything

00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:11,131 line:-2
about all that meditation
has done for me,


159
00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.399 line:-1 align:center
but let me just hear from you.


160
00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.268 line:-2 align:center
If somebody's watching this
and thinking,


161
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,738 line:-2
"Why should I do this?
What's in it for me?"


162
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,940 line:-1
How do you answer that question?


163
00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:22.042 line:-2 align:center
[Jeff]
How about emancipation?


164
00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:25.979 line:-2 align:center
I would say that's probably--
for me, it's been sanity,


165
00:07:26.013 --> 00:07:30.083 line:-2 align:center
and it's been a sense
of more control in my life.


166
00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:33.954 line:-2 align:center
More control over my--
how I respond


167
00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:36.290 line:-2 align:center
to the world
and not being a victim


168
00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:40.227 line:-2 align:center
to every impulse
and whim and emotion


169
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,663 line:-2
and mood that picks me up
and takes me around,


170
00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:44.164 line:-1 align:center
which they do a lot.


171
00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:47.501 line:-2 align:center
So it's been--it's kind of,
like, given me my life back.


172
00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:48.936 line:-1 align:center
So--not all at once.


173
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,904 line:-2
It's kind of
a progressive thing,


174
00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:54.107 line:-2 align:center
but there's no question
that's been the big effect,


175
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:55.843 line:-2 align:center
and then the roll-on effect
from that


176
00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:59.513 line:-2 align:center
is when you're
more centered in your life,


177
00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:03.016 line:-2 align:center
you're more available
for everyone else.


178
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.953 line:-2 align:center
So my relationships,
yeah, they've gotten better —


179
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,790 line:-2
my friendships,
my family relationships —


180
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:13,093 line:-2
I mean, the roll-on effects
are quite significant.


181
00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:15.662 line:-1 align:center
So how's that for a start?


182
00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:18.899 line:-2 align:center
[Dan] You and I
are meditation nerds.


183
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,968 line:-2
I mean, unreconstructed
meditation nerds,


184
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:25.506 line:-2 align:center
and I think appropriately
based on scientific evidence


185
00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:27.274 line:-2 align:center
and the evidence
of our own minds,


186
00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:30.410 line:-2 align:center
we are focused on getting people
thinking about meditation.


187
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:34,014 line:-2
And I do, though, want to say
that I kind of put meditation


188
00:08:34.047 --> 00:08:36.984 line:-2 align:center
in what I call a pantheon
of no-brainers when it comes


189
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,253 line:-1
to taking care of yourself


190
00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:41.455 line:-2 align:center
so that you can be
maximally effective,


191
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,691 line:-2
and I think there are
probably at least five


192
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,660 line:-2
other things I would
put in this pantheon.


193
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,228 line:-1
So start with meditation,


194
00:08:48.262 --> 00:08:52.032 line:-2 align:center
but I would also add sleep,
which is incredibly important.


195
00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:55.435 line:-2 align:center
Exercise,
healthy eating--


196
00:08:55.469 --> 00:08:58.805 line:-2 align:center
without getting
too obsessive about it,


197
00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:00.274 line:-2 align:center
so I think it's important
to eat healthy


198
00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:02.676 line:-2 align:center
but not to the point
where you're obsessing


199
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.711 line:-2 align:center
about what you're eating
all the time.


200
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:09,283 line:-2
The fourth thing I would
say is nature, access to nature.


201
00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:13.153 line:-2 align:center
There's a ton of data
that strongly indicate


202
00:09:13.187 --> 00:09:16.690 line:-2 align:center
that if you are getting
consistent access to nature


203
00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.326 line:-2 align:center
that it's going to have
all sorts of physiological


204
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,727 line:-1
and psychological benefits.


205
00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:22.196 line:-2 align:center
And then finally,
and I mentioned this


206
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,965 line:-2
a little bit earlier,
but I think it bears repeating.


207
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,669 line:-2
The quality
of your relationships--


208
00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:30.871 line:-2 align:center
now I'm stealing a quote
from somebody else,


209
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,974 line:-2
so I'll own that
in the middle of this quote.


210
00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:36.243 line:-2 align:center
"The quality
of your relationships


211
00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:38.579 line:-2 align:center
will dictate
the quality of your life."


212
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,814 line:-2
That's a quote
from Esther Perel


213
00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:44.518 line:-2 align:center
who's a legendary
couples counselor and podcaster.


214
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:48.922 line:-1 align:center
And, you know, it's so true


215
00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:52.392 line:-1 align:center
as to be a truism in some ways,


216
00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:54.494 line:-2 align:center
this notion
that relationships matter.


217
00:09:54.528 --> 00:09:56.697 line:-1 align:center
We are a social species.


218
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.999 line:-2 align:center
The reason why,
for better or worse,


219
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,234 line:-1
humans took over the planet


220
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,668 line:-2
is not because
we were the strongest.


221
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,170 line:-2
It was because
we could work together


222
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,273 line:-2
to take down the mastodon
or whatever it was,


223
00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:08.942 line:-2 align:center
so this need
for social connection is,


224
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:14,214 line:-2
you know, just baked
into the motherboard for us,


225
00:10:14.248 --> 00:10:16.850 line:-2 align:center
and that was my attempt
to use some sort


226
00:10:16.884 --> 00:10:18.552 line:-2 align:center
of vaguely
technological language.


227
00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:20.120 line:-2 align:center
I don't even know
if that was appropriate,


228
00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:22.389 line:-2 align:center
but, anyway,
it's baked into our DNA


229
00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:24.825 line:-2 align:center
and so--
but it's easily overlooked


230
00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:26.727 line:-2 align:center
at a time--
especially in the West


231
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.531 line:-2 align:center
when there's such an emphasis
on individual achievement


232
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,766 line:-2
and we tend to live
away from our families —


233
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,602 line:-2
and the number of people who say
they have close confidants


234
00:10:35.636 --> 00:10:38.405 line:-1 align:center
has declined over time —


235
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,909 line:-2
and many of us have our nose
in screens all the time —


236
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:45,279 line:-2
that there's a way in which
we can deemphasize the value


237
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,314 line:-2
of relationships —
and we have just run


238
00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:50.984 line:-1 align:center
a global unregulated experiment


239
00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:54.621 line:-2 align:center
in what happens
when you deny social connection,


240
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,424 line:-2
and the results
are really clear…


241
00:10:57.457 --> 00:11:00.060 line:-2 align:center
massive spikes
in anxiety, depression,


242
00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:01.528 line:-1 align:center
addiction, and suicide.


243
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:03,030 line:-2
[Jeff]
Oh, my God, absolutely.


244
00:11:03.063 --> 00:11:04.565 line:-2 align:center
[Dan] I think something
that a lot of people


245
00:11:04.598 --> 00:11:06.533 line:-1 align:center
are struggling with now


246
00:11:06.567 --> 00:11:09.102 line:-2 align:center
after this long period
of lockdown,


247
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:12,406 line:-2
which, for many of us,
is not over —


248
00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:14.441 line:-2 align:center
in some parts of the world,
we're emerging from lockdown —


249
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,510 line:-2
in some parts of the world,
we're really still in it —


250
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,512 line:-2
but social anxiety
is a real issue.


251
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,447 line:-2
It was a real issue
going into the pandemic


252
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.816 line:-2 align:center
and I would imagine
even more so now.


253
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,219 line:-2
Do you have any thoughts
about how to manage that?


254
00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:27.588 line:-2 align:center
[Jeff]
I would say a couple things.


255
00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:31.491 line:-2 align:center
The first is a seated practice
of five or ten minutes


256
00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:34.027 line:-2 align:center
of just getting relaxed
will center you


257
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,829 line:-1
and make you--and, you know,


258
00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:37.531 line:-2 align:center
help you manage
that anxiety a little bit more.


259
00:11:37.564 --> 00:11:40.334 line:-2 align:center
I mean, that's just a kind of
a no-brainer


260
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,835 line:-1
from my perspective.


261
00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:46.807 line:-2 align:center
Another thing is to get clear
about what is


262
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.610 line:-2 align:center
actually making you anxious
and share that


263
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,311 line:-2
with the people that you need
to hang out with.


264
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:53,347 line:-2
So this is, again,
where the mindfulness thing


265
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.581 line:-1 align:center
can be useful.


266
00:11:54.615 --> 00:11:56.884 line:-2 align:center
You know, we may
have a specific anxiety


267
00:11:56.917 --> 00:11:58.619 line:-1 align:center
'cause, you know,


268
00:11:58.652 --> 00:12:01.188 line:-2 align:center
you have some friends that want
to suddenly abandon the masks


269
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,624 line:-2
and start hugging way sooner
than you're ready to do it,


270
00:12:03.657 --> 00:12:06.260 line:-2 align:center
or you're worried about the--
you have specific anxieties


271
00:12:06.293 --> 00:12:09.029 line:-2 align:center
about travel or you're--
whatever it is,


272
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.064 line:-2 align:center
like, you
have a specific anxiety,


273
00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:14.168 line:-2 align:center
but until you actually
look and notice what it is,


274
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:15.502 line:-1 align:center
that thing will own you


275
00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:17.571 line:-2 align:center
in a kind of a vague,
generalized way.


276
00:12:17.604 --> 00:12:19.039 line:-2 align:center
You'll just know
you don't really want


277
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.140 line:-1 align:center
to go outside around people.


278
00:12:20.174 --> 00:12:21.942 line:-2 align:center
You won't really have
a good excuse for what it is,


279
00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:23.443 line:-1 align:center
or you can't really--you know,


280
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,779 line:-2
you're just--because you
haven't brought clarity


281
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,447 line:-2
to what's actually going
on in your experience.


282
00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:30.751 line:-2 align:center
So taking the time
to really identify,


283
00:12:30.784 --> 00:12:33.187 line:-2 align:center
what is
it that I'm worried about?


284
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.988 line:-2 align:center
Can I--what
is the specific thing?


285
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,624 line:-2
And then, based on that,
having conversations


286
00:12:37.658 --> 00:12:40.460 line:-2 align:center
with the people in your life
around--if there's any protocols


287
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,996 line:-2
you might be able
to collectively agree on.


288
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,100 line:-2
I mean, that's--it may sound
so common-sense,


289
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:51,038 line:-2
but I think this is, again,
the great move of practice,


290
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:54.374 line:-2 align:center
the great move of mindfulness
is to begin to actually


291
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,643 line:-2
clarify what's really going on
in your experience,


292
00:12:56.677 --> 00:12:58.312 line:-2 align:center
and we may hear that
and think, "Oh, yeah,


293
00:12:58.345 --> 00:12:59.313 line:-1 align:center
that makes sense."


294
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,747 line:-2
But we don't realize
that we're subject


295
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,217 line:-2
to this kind of
unconscious thing all the time,


296
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.285 line:-2 align:center
that we're
not actually doing that.


297
00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:06.854 line:-1 align:center
We don't have a lot of clarity


298
00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:08.822 line:-2 align:center
about what would
actually help us.


299
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,959 line:-2
[Dan] People may be wondering,
"OK, how do I do this?


300
00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:14.261 line:-1 align:center
How do I start meditating?"


301
00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.797 line:-2 align:center
And often,
the question people have is,


302
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.299 line:-2 align:center
"What's the least amount
I can do


303
00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:21.835 line:-2 align:center
and get all of
the advertised benefits?"


304
00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:23.837 line:-2 align:center
What's your recommendation
for folks


305
00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:25.506 line:-2 align:center
who are trying to boot up
a habit?


306
00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:28.709 line:-1 align:center
- Five minutes, ten minutes?


307
00:13:28.742 --> 00:13:32.279 line:-2 align:center
I mean, what you want is to give
your nervous system a taste.


308
00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:36.717 line:-2 align:center
So I would say just start
with five minutes a day.


309
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.954 line:-2 align:center
And just--and then, you know,
let the practice inform you.


310
00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:42.823 line:-2 align:center
If you do five minutes
and, you know,


311
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:43,857 line:-1
you can play around with--


312
00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:45.626 line:-2 align:center
I mean, the basic strategy
is just to sit


313
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,327 line:-2
and notice your breath,
but you can play around


314
00:13:47.361 --> 00:13:48.996 line:-2 align:center
with other objects,
something else


315
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,797 line:-2
that's just whatever,
for whatever reason,


316
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:52.165 line:-1 align:center
is interesting to you.


317
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,901 line:-2
But take five minutes
and see if you can


318
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,303 line:-2
completely commit yourself
in that way,


319
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,839 line:-2
and then notice--do you feel
a little bit more settled after?


320
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,175 line:-2
If you do, then that's
a good place to begin.


321
00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:04.545 line:-2 align:center
And then, you know, I--
there's value


322
00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:06.146 line:-1 align:center
to moving it up from there,


323
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,549 line:-2
but sometimes
five minutes a day is all I get,


324
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,217 line:-2
but I'm gonna actually
throw it back to you,


325
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,251 line:-2
Dan, 'cause
I know you're, like,


326
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:15,088 line:-2
the expert at getting
regular folks to meditate.


327
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,124 line:-2
So what's
your advice around this?


328
00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:19.459 line:-2 align:center
[Dan] I'll lower
the bar even further.


329
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:23,430 line:-2
Try to meditate
for at least one minute


330
00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:26.733 line:-1 align:center
on 25 out of 31 days.


331
00:14:26.767 --> 00:14:29.002 line:-2 align:center
And this is actually
backed by science.


332
00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:31.839 line:-2 align:center
What we know
about habit formation


333
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,275 line:-2
is that it is
infernally difficult


334
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,945 line:-2
and that the best way
to approach it


335
00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:40.647 line:-2 align:center
is with a sense of humor,
a sense of exploration,


336
00:14:40.681 --> 00:14:42.182 line:-1 align:center
and a sense of humility,


337
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,251 line:-2
that it's hard for everybody,
including you,


338
00:14:44.284 --> 00:14:48.555 line:-2 align:center
and so if you set the bar low,
you're more likely to succeed,


339
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:50,657 line:-2
and so we have
these two little slogans


340
00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:53.927 line:-2 align:center
that kind of govern
our approach,


341
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:55.362 line:-2 align:center
and actually I came up
with these slogans


342
00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.197 line:-2 align:center
while working with you, Jeff,
on our book,


343
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:59.233 line:-2 align:center
"Meditation
for Fidgety Skeptics."


344
00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:02.402 line:-2 align:center
One slogan is
"One minute counts."


345
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:03,804 line:-2
Yes, I would love
to see you


346
00:15:03.837 --> 00:15:06.006 line:-2 align:center
do five to ten minutes,
even more,


347
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,343 line:-2
but let's be honest, again,
given what I said,


348
00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:11.879 line:-2 align:center
what we all know
about habit formation


349
00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:14.348 line:-1 align:center
being difficult, one minute--


350
00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:16.750 line:-2 align:center
in one minute
you can get a sense


351
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,186 line:-1
of how wild the mind is,


352
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,388 line:-2
and therefore you have
a little bit of a leg up


353
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,790 line:-2
in dealing with
all of the terrible ideas


354
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:25,492 line:-2
that the voice in your head
is offering up


355
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:26,827 line:-1
to you on the regular.


356
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,030 line:-2
And then the other
little slogan is "daily-ish."


357
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,798 line:-2
Again, I would love
to see you do this every day.


358
00:15:31.832 --> 00:15:34.735 line:-2 align:center
I try to do it every day,
but if you tell yourself,


359
00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.370 line:-1 align:center
"I am gonna do this every day,"


360
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,838 line:-1
and then you miss a day,


361
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,474 line:-2
there is some
reasonable likelihood


362
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,309 line:-2
that the voice in your head
will swoop in


363
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,444 line:-2
and tell you, "Well,
you're a failed meditator now.


364
00:15:44.478 --> 00:15:45.946 line:-1 align:center
Deuces, I'm out."


365
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:49,583 line:-2
And so "daily-ish" provides
what the psychologists call


366
00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.485 line:-1 align:center
psychological flexibility.


367
00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:53.387 line:-2 align:center
It's a kind of elasticity
that allows you


368
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,291 line:-2
to start over,
and that resiliency,


369
00:15:57.324 --> 00:15:59.359 line:-2 align:center
the capacity
to start over, is so key


370
00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:01.862 line:-1 align:center
in a meditation practice


371
00:16:01.895 --> 00:16:03.263 line:-2 align:center
while you're
actually meditating,


372
00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:06.767 line:-2 align:center
and it is so key when it comes
to starting any habit


373
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.803 line:-2 align:center
that you have to--
because it's so hard


374
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:12,306 line:-1
to do this, you have to be able


375
00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:14.541 line:-2 align:center
to pick yourself up
after three weeks


376
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,977 line:-2
of not meditating
or three weeks of not exercising


377
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,445 line:-2
and say,
"OK, nothing's been lost.


378
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.314 line:-1 align:center
I can just start again."


379
00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:22.015 line:-2 align:center
So I know
I lowered the bar there, Jeff,


380
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,150 line:-1
from what you said.


381
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,019 line:-2
Does that give you--
does that give you hives?


382
00:16:26.053 --> 00:16:27.354 line:-2 align:center
[Jeff]
No, not at all.


383
00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:28.722 line:-1 align:center
I mean, I use the same thing,


384
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:32,259 line:-2
so I think it's exactly--
I mean, do what works.


385
00:16:32.292 --> 00:16:34.561 line:-2 align:center
Do whatever you can
to start to kind of get into it,


386
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:36,597 line:-2
get a bit of a taste of it,
and I think one minute is--


387
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.399 line:-2 align:center
if that can give you
a taste of it, perfect.


388
00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:42.503 line:-2 align:center
[Dan] So since we keep talking
about meditation, Jeff,


389
00:16:42.536 --> 00:16:45.439 line:-2 align:center
it may make sense to me--
if you're up for it,


390
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,141 line:-2
to--let's just do
just a few minutes


391
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,277 line:-2
of it 'cause I think
once people have a sense


392
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,380 line:-2
of how simple this is
and how doable it is--


393
00:16:53.413 --> 00:16:55.415 line:-1 align:center
are you game for that?


394
00:16:55.449 --> 00:16:57.284 line:-2 align:center
[Jeff]
Oh, yes, I am.


395
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,257 line:-2
In fact,
I was thinking--


396
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,559 line:-2
I'm gonna guide a dead-simple,
five minute meditation,


397
00:17:05.592 --> 00:17:09.663 line:-2 align:center
but I'm gonna do it
with our audience in mind,


398
00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:13.333 line:-2 align:center
knowing that we have
a group of creatives


399
00:17:13.367 --> 00:17:15.702 line:-1 align:center
and developers and programmers.


400
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:19,039 line:-1
I'm gonna use this metaphor


401
00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:20.974 line:-1 align:center
that I'll thread into it


402
00:17:21.008 --> 00:17:23.177 line:-2 align:center
that will hopefully speak
to that audience


403
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,380 line:-2
and help actually dramatize
what it is we're doing.


404
00:17:26.413 --> 00:17:29.483 line:-2 align:center
So that's the five-minute
meditation intro.


405
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:33,287 line:-1
So go ahead and close your eyes.


406
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,489 line:-2
Get yourself into,
you know, whatever position


407
00:17:35.522 --> 00:17:37.691 line:-1 align:center
just feels comfortable.


408
00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.793 line:-2 align:center
Actually, you can even
have them open if you like,


409
00:17:39.826 --> 00:17:40.961 line:-2 align:center
looking at the ground
in front of you.


410
00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:42.663 line:-1 align:center
It's sort of user's choice.


411
00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:47.100 line:-2 align:center
Now if you're closing
your eyes or open,


412
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,669 line:-2
you start
with a few deep breaths…


413
00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:53.874 line:-2 align:center
stretching out the spine
on the inhale…


414
00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.642 line:-2 align:center
and then the exhale
is kind of like


415
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,946 line:-2
your "ahhhhh…”
Super relaxing.


416
00:17:58.979 --> 00:18:02.616 line:-2 align:center
Sending a wave of relaxation
down through the body,


417
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:06,720 line:-2
meaning deliberately
softening your forehead...


418
00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:09.756 line:-1 align:center
and your shoulders...


419
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,791 line:-1
and your belly.


420
00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:15.596 line:-2 align:center
With each exhale,
you can imagine


421
00:18:15.629 --> 00:18:18.265 line:-2 align:center
you're, you know,
settling a little more,


422
00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:20.734 line:-2 align:center
landing a little more
in your chair


423
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,202 line:-1
or wherever you're sitting.


424
00:18:27.074 --> 00:18:28.442 line:-2 align:center
And the first thing
I like to do


425
00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:30.444 line:-2 align:center
at the very start
of the meditation


426
00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:34.281 line:-2 align:center
is--it's sort of tuning in
with this internal adjustment,


427
00:18:34.314 --> 00:18:36.884 line:-2 align:center
the equanimity adjustment,
which just means


428
00:18:36.917 --> 00:18:39.520 line:-2 align:center
the "letting everything be here"
adjustment.


429
00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:42.623 line:-2 align:center
So you're not gonna get uptight
about sounds being imperfect


430
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:46,126 line:-2
in your environment or the fact
that you might have lots


431
00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:47.961 line:-2 align:center
of thoughts
or very few thoughts


432
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:51,265 line:-1
or your body's uncomfortable.


433
00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:53.400 line:-2 align:center
It's all--the idea
is that you're just gonna


434
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,768 line:-1
let all this be there.


435
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,140 line:-2
We're kind of embracing
the imperfection of life,


436
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:03,010 line:-2
and that actually is palpable
as an adjustment.


437
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:05,546 line:-2
It's sort of, like, this--
the other way of being is


438
00:19:05.579 --> 00:19:07.881 line:-2 align:center
a kind of uptightness.
[growls]


439
00:19:07.915 --> 00:19:11.818 line:-2 align:center
Instead, just kind of
melting everything.


440
00:19:11.852 --> 00:19:14.354 line:-1 align:center
So sounds just pass through you.


441
00:19:14.388 --> 00:19:17.291 line:-2 align:center
Body sensations and thoughts
rise and fall.


442
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,325 line:-1
It's all good.


443
00:19:20.694 --> 00:19:24.198 line:-2 align:center
And then we settle
into this creaturely pose.


444
00:19:26.233 --> 00:19:28.068 line:-1 align:center
Maybe feeling the breath.


445
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:35,209 line:-2
And what's happening here is--
it's like our experience


446
00:19:35.242 --> 00:19:37.411 line:-1 align:center
has all these different layers.


447
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,520 line:-2
And there's sort of
an "into it" quality


448
00:19:46.553 --> 00:19:47.521 line:-1 align:center
in meditation.


449
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:51,024 line:-2
Sort of one of the secrets
is you choose.


450
00:19:51.058 --> 00:19:52.326 line:-1 align:center
You decide.


451
00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:54.261 line:-2 align:center
Not only are you choosing
which layer to pay attention to.


452
00:19:54.294 --> 00:19:56.830 line:-2 align:center
You're kind of choosing
to maybe a little bit


453
00:19:56.864 --> 00:20:01.535 line:-2 align:center
enjoy this opportunity
to take a break.


454
00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:04.938 line:-2 align:center
Seeing if you can kind of
get into the feeling


455
00:20:04.972 --> 00:20:07.274 line:-2 align:center
of breathing
like you're kind of into it.


456
00:20:11.578 --> 00:20:13.447 line:-2 align:center
You know,
if we make it enjoyable,


457
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,616 line:-2
you're just gonna want
to meditate more,


458
00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:18.886 line:-2 align:center
as opposed to making it
some grim endurance test.


459
00:20:25.259 --> 00:20:28.095 line:-2 align:center
The mind wanders.
Totally natural.


460
00:20:28.128 --> 00:20:33.367 line:-2 align:center
You notice 'cause you've got
this awareness thing going on.


461
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,736 line:-2
You notice that layer
that got activated


462
00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:37.204 line:-1 align:center
that superimposed itself


463
00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:40.607 line:-2 align:center
over top of the breath
and kind of drifted away,


464
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:43,911 line:-2
and then you come back
to the breath layer.


465
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.815 line:-2 align:center
And you let the thought
just play out on its own.


466
00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:50.184 line:-1 align:center
Now you're not feeding it.


467
00:20:52.119 --> 00:20:53.287 line:-1 align:center
It doesn't have to go away.


468
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,755 line:-2
You're not trying
to get rid of thinking.


469
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:57,591 line:-2
That thinking process
will just keep unspooling.


470
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:05,766 line:-2
So just for fun here -
we're working with our layers -


471
00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:09.603 line:-2 align:center
we just select
this item in the menu,


472
00:21:09.636 --> 00:21:11.939 line:-2 align:center
in the drop-down menu,
one of the tools —


473
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:14,842 line:-1
the good-naturedness tool.


474
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,510 line:-1
Make sure that's selected.


475
00:21:16.543 --> 00:21:19.079 line:-2 align:center
It's kind of like you're kind of
putting a warm glow


476
00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.448 line:-2 align:center
over everything,
so you're just kind of--


477
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:23.183 line:-1 align:center
you're enjoying your experience.


478
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,658 line:-2
I'm going to risk
a 20-second silence here


479
00:21:31.692 --> 00:21:33.327 line:-1 align:center
before we wrap it up,


480
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.394 line:-1 align:center
then I'll come in at the end,


481
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:37,497 line:-1
but just seeing how fully


482
00:21:37.531 --> 00:21:39.933 line:-1 align:center
you can commit yourself to this.


483
00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:41.735 line:-1 align:center
Some sensation in the body.


484
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:54,481 line:-2
The more we feel
what's here in the body,


485
00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:59.253 line:-2 align:center
things start to settle.
Sensations get subtler.


486
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:00,821 line:-1
As we get more still,


487
00:22:00.854 --> 00:22:03.257 line:-2 align:center
our experience
often gets more still —


488
00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:08.228 line:-2 align:center
and then a thought
comes and takes us away.


489
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:10,430 line:-1
That layer gets activated.


490
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:11,698 line:-2
We notice.
We come back.


491
00:22:11.732 --> 00:22:15.068 line:-2 align:center
And that's the--
that's the movement of practice.


492
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:19,406 line:-2
The movement is committing,
getting distracted,


493
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,875 line:-2
recommitting,
and then suffusing


494
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:26,647 line:-2
the proceedings with a kind of
equanimous good-naturedness.


495
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:32,586 line:-2
So I'll just let us have
a few more seconds here.


496
00:22:42.596 --> 00:22:45.566 line:-2 align:center
And then as we prepare
to move out


497
00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:48.435 line:-2 align:center
of this
extremely short meditation,


498
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:53,207 line:-2
just notice…
Do you feel more settled?


499
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,543 line:-1
… More present?


500
00:22:56.577 --> 00:22:59.179 line:-2 align:center
And that's
the litmus test ultimately.


501
00:22:59.213 --> 00:23:01.915 line:-2 align:center
How is it--how do you
bring the practice back?


502
00:23:06.253 --> 00:23:09.489 line:-2 align:center
Now when you're ready,
open your eyes.


503
00:23:17.564 --> 00:23:18.732 line:-2 align:center
[Dan]
Thank you, Jeff.


504
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:23,770 line:-2
There were two things
you emphasized, at least,


505
00:23:23.804 --> 00:23:25.739 line:-1 align:center
in that meditation


506
00:23:25.772 --> 00:23:28.575 line:-2 align:center
that I want
to kind of just reemphasize.


507
00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:32.913 line:-2 align:center
One is the immense benefit
of getting out


508
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:36,116 line:-1
of your head and into your body.


509
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:42,122 line:-2
It's--this is sadly a bit
of a cliché, you know,


510
00:23:42.155 --> 00:23:43.824 line:-2 align:center
the body knows,
et cetera, et cetera,


511
00:23:43.857 --> 00:23:46.460 line:-2 align:center
but there's a reason
why clichés become clichés,


512
00:23:46.493 --> 00:23:48.495 line:-1 align:center
and that's because they're true.


513
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:52,666 line:-2
And I love this word you used
where you get us to kind of


514
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:55,502 line:-2
get in touch
with the creaturely feeling


515
00:23:55.536 --> 00:23:57.938 line:-1 align:center
of having a body.


516
00:23:57.971 --> 00:24:02.142 line:-2 align:center
Most of us, you know, we're like
Macy's Day parade balloons.


517
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:04,945 line:-2
We're just all head
floating through the world


518
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:07,948 line:-2
with a tiny little body
just dragged beneath it,


519
00:24:07.981 --> 00:24:12.386 line:-2 align:center
but actually there's
enormous potential


520
00:24:12.419 --> 00:24:14.655 line:-2 align:center
to getting out
of the spinning stories,


521
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:16,590 line:-2
which are
mostly past and future,


522
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:20,127 line:-2
and into your body.
It can be really calming.


523
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.763 line:-1 align:center
The other thing you talked about


524
00:24:22.796 --> 00:24:25.432 line:-1 align:center
is the fact that we are


525
00:24:25.465 --> 00:24:27.334 line:-2 align:center
gonna be distracted
in meditation.


526
00:24:27.367 --> 00:24:29.736 line:-2 align:center
All sorts of crazy things
are gonna go through your mind.


527
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,238 line:-2
What's for lunch?
Do we need a haircut?


528
00:24:31.271 --> 00:24:32.840 line:-1 align:center
Blah, blah, blah…


529
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:38,212 line:-2
And a lot of people feel or fear
that when they get distracted


530
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:40,714 line:-2
in this way,
when they sit and meditate


531
00:24:40.747 --> 00:24:42.983 line:-2 align:center
and notice
that working with the mind


532
00:24:43.016 --> 00:24:45.919 line:-2 align:center
is a little bit like holding
a live fish in your hand,


533
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:48,956 line:-2
a lot of people
tell themselves a story


534
00:24:48.989 --> 00:24:50.724 line:-2 align:center
that,
"Oh, I'm a failed meditator.


535
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:52,192 line:-1
I can never do this."


536
00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:55,229 line:-2
And that's because there's this
really pernicious misconception


537
00:24:55.262 --> 00:24:58.765 line:-2 align:center
that correct meditation
involves clearing your mind.


538
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.569 line:-2 align:center
As I like to joke,
clearing your mind


539
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:04,238 line:-2
isn't possible
unless you're enlightened


540
00:25:04.271 --> 00:25:05.672 line:-1 align:center
or you've died.


541
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:08,108 line:-2
The whole game in meditation
is to notice


542
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:11,979 line:-2
when you've become distracted…
again and again and again…


543
00:25:12.012 --> 00:25:13.213 line:-1 align:center
and just start over,


544
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:16,116 line:-2
and this is the bicep curl
for your brain,


545
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:17,451 line:-1
and this is what shows up


546
00:25:17.484 --> 00:25:20.220 line:-2 align:center
on the brain scans
of meditators.


547
00:25:21.555 --> 00:25:23.357 line:-2 align:center
So I just want to--
and by the way,


548
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,892 line:-1
it has this really important--


549
00:25:24.925 --> 00:25:27.027 line:-2 align:center
I shouldn't--
this isn't a "by the way."


550
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.197 line:-2 align:center
This is a
"Here's the sales point."


551
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:34.835 line:-2 align:center
The value
of seeing the cacophony


552
00:25:34.868 --> 00:25:38.405 line:-2 align:center
and chaos of your own mind
is that when you're ambushed


553
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:43,510 line:-2
by anger or random urges
or random distracting thoughts


554
00:25:43.544 --> 00:25:46.079 line:-2 align:center
off the cushion
in your actual life,


555
00:25:46.113 --> 00:25:48.115 line:-2 align:center
you're less likely
to be owned by it.


556
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:50,384 line:-2
That's what we're doing here
in meditation is getting


557
00:25:50.417 --> 00:25:53.520 line:-2 align:center
more familiar with the workings
of our own mind


558
00:25:53.554 --> 00:25:56.190 line:-2 align:center
so that it's not yanking us
around all the time,


559
00:25:56.223 --> 00:25:58.759 line:-2 align:center
so that we can learn
how to respond wisely


560
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:02,829 line:-2
to the things in our life
instead of reacting blindly.


561
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:04,765 line:-2
So anyway, Jeff,
I just said a bunch of stuff.


562
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:06,800 line:-2
Does any of that
make sense to you?


563
00:26:06.834 --> 00:26:08.402 line:-2 align:center
[Jeff]
It doesn't just make sense.


564
00:26:08.435 --> 00:26:11.305 line:-2 align:center
It's familiar to the benefits
of how meditation


565
00:26:11.338 --> 00:26:13.040 line:-2 align:center
have showed up
in my life personally.


566
00:26:13.073 --> 00:26:16.143 line:-2 align:center
Everything you just said there,
I've found to be true for me.


567
00:26:16.176 --> 00:26:17.144 line:-2 align:center
[Dan]
Beautiful.


568
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:18,579 line:-2
Let me ask you
one last question, Jeff,


569
00:26:18.612 --> 00:26:20.447 line:-1 align:center
before we let everybody go.


570
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:23,817 line:-1
Especially for this crowd,


571
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:26,520 line:-2
I think
an interesting question is,


572
00:26:26.553 --> 00:26:29.957 line:-2 align:center
"How do we manage what,
for many of us,


573
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,160 line:-2
is a fraught relationship
to technology?"


574
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:36,730 line:-2
What do you do to make sure
that you're using technology


575
00:26:36.763 --> 00:26:40.234 line:-2 align:center
as a tool and not having it
the other way around


576
00:26:40.267 --> 00:26:42.069 line:-2 align:center
where the technology
is owning you?


577
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,704 line:-2
[Jeff] Well, I mean,
it's super hard


578
00:26:43.737 --> 00:26:45.038 line:-2 align:center
because so many
of our connections


579
00:26:45.072 --> 00:26:46.273 line:-1 align:center
happen virtually now.


580
00:26:46,306 --> 00:26:49,443 line:-2
I mean, that's how I
stay connected to my parents,


581
00:26:49.476 --> 00:26:51.512 line:-2 align:center
you know, and my friends
all over the place.


582
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,882 line:-1
All my work happens.


583
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:58,085 line:-2
I would say
it's being smart about


584
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:00,521 line:-2
getting balance
in the nervous system


585
00:27:00.554 --> 00:27:03.090 line:-2 align:center
by not being so fixated
on a single thing,


586
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,960 line:-2
and you get that feedback
by beginning to pay attention


587
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:08,195 line:-2
to what's going on,
you know?


588
00:27:08,228 --> 00:27:11,098 line:-2
So you take a--you know,
you take a pause


589
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:13.467 line:-2 align:center
in your work and you go,
"OK, let me check in.


590
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.169 line:-1 align:center
How am I doing over here?"


591
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:18,205 line:-2
I mean, that's the--
the mind is very, very powerful.


592
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:20,841 line:-2
It's like a superpower,
but it will completely take over


593
00:27:20.874 --> 00:27:22.242 line:-1 align:center
with its obsessiveness.


594
00:27:22.276 --> 00:27:25.779 line:-2 align:center
So I think that that's
how I manage my technology use.


595
00:27:25.812 --> 00:27:29.216 line:-2 align:center
I'm constantly stopping,
stretching,


596
00:27:29.249 --> 00:27:31.185 line:-1 align:center
going for a walk, come back.


597
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:33,420 line:-2
And I also make sure
that I'm only, you know,


598
00:27:33.453 --> 00:27:35.923 line:-2 align:center
doing X amount
of screen time a day,


599
00:27:35.956 --> 00:27:38.592 line:-2 align:center
and that amount of time
is a lot lower now


600
00:27:38.625 --> 00:27:39.626 line:-1 align:center
than it used to be.


601
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:42,062 line:-2
[Dan] I just want
to wrap up here


602
00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:45.899 line:-1 align:center
with one final appeal.


603
00:27:48.068 --> 00:27:51.605 line:-1 align:center
I think happiness is


604
00:27:51.638 --> 00:27:55.742 line:-2 align:center
such a commonly-
misunderstood concept.


605
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,045 line:-2
What the science
around meditation


606
00:27:58,078 --> 00:28:00,714 line:-1
is showing us, the neuroscience,


607
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:04,251 line:-2
the looking into people's brains
and looking at what happens


608
00:28:04.284 --> 00:28:07.054 line:-2 align:center
when they meditate -
what this is showing us


609
00:28:07.087 --> 00:28:10.357 line:-1 align:center
is that happiness is a skill -


610
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:15,062 line:-2
that the mind is trainable -
that all the things we want


611
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:18,365 line:-2
can really be boiled down
to mind states.


612
00:28:18.398 --> 00:28:21.635 line:-2 align:center
We may think we want
professional success,


613
00:28:21.668 --> 00:28:26.607 line:-2 align:center
romantic success,
to get that new car,


614
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.575 line:-1 align:center
to go on that big vacation,


615
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:30,344 line:-2
all of which are fine
to have as goals,


616
00:28:30.377 --> 00:28:32.079 line:-2 align:center
but what we really want
are the mental states


617
00:28:32,112 --> 00:28:34,481 line:-1
that accompany those goals.


618
00:28:34.515 --> 00:28:36.216 line:-2 align:center
And as it turns out,
all of these


619
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:41.154 line:-2 align:center
mental states--
calm, happiness, connection,


620
00:28:41.188 --> 00:28:44.725 line:-1 align:center
compassion, love--


621
00:28:44.758 --> 00:28:48.228 line:-1 align:center
these are trainable skills,
