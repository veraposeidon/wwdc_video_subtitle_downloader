"Manage Devices
with Apple Configurator."


8
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,382 line:-1
I am Pradhap Natarajan,


9
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,317 line:-1
an engineer
on the Device Management team


10
00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:18.752 line:-1 position:50%
here at Apple.


11
00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:22.322 line:-1 position:50%
Today, I am going to walk you
through some exciting updates


12
00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.424 line:-1 position:50%
to Apple Configurator.


13
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,895 line:-1
Configurator makes it easy
to deploy iPad, iPhone,


14
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:31,398 line:-1
and Apple TV devices
in your school or business.


15
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,201 line:-1
It features a flexible
device-centric design


16
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:38.038 line:-1 position:50%
that enables you to configure
one or dozens of devices


17
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,641 line:-1
quickly and easily.


18
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,110 line:-1
You can inspect any device
to see details


19
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.313 line:-1 position:50%
like the serial number
and hardware addresses,


20
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:51,151 line:-1
installed apps, and profiles.


21
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,387 line:-1
In addition to apps
and profiles,


22
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,691 line:-1
Configurator can also install
books and software updates.


23
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:01,695 line:-1
Blueprints provide a great way
to apply the same configuration


24
00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:05.699 line:-1 position:50%
to large numbers of devices
with a single click.


25
00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:09.403 line:-1 position:50%
Configurator also provides
a rich set of automation tools,


26
00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:13.206 line:-1 position:50%
including a command line tool,
an AppleScript library,


27
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,876 line:-1
and a suite
of Automator actions.


28
00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:21.214 line:-1 position:50%
Initially, Configurator
supported iOS and tvOS devices.


29
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,750 line:-1
But recently,
it has learned some new tricks


30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,486 line:-1
for managing Mac computers
as well.


31
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,756 line:-1
We introduced the ability
to restore and revive a Mac,


32
00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:34.394 line:-1 position:50%
beginning with models
with the Apple T2 Security Chip.


33
00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.964 line:-1 position:50%
And last year,
we brought those features


34
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,466 line:-1
to each Mac with Apple silicon.


35
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,736 line:-1
There are two ways to use
Configurator with a Mac.


36
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,505 position:50%
First, Restore is a great way


37
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,875 position:50%
to return a Mac
with Apple silicon to service


38
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,746 position:50%
by reinstalling
the latest macOS version.


39
00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:54.514 line:-1 position:50%
On a Mac with the T2 chip,


40
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,883 line:-1
this action restores
the firmware,


41
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,319 line:-1
after which macOS
can be reinstalled


42
00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.254 line:-1 position:50%
using internet recovery.


43
00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.690 line:-1 position:50%
The second is Revive.


44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,661 position:50%
Revive helps you recover a
Mac while preserving user data.


45
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,963 position:50%
Occasionally,
things can go wrong.


46
00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:13.166 line:-1 position:50%
For example, a MacBook Pro
could run out of battery


47
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,135 line:-1
during a software update.


48
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,269 line:-1
In these situations,


49
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:20,107 line:-1
a Mac with Apple silicon
or a T2 chip can be revived


50
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:25,345 line:-1
which updates the firmware
while preserving user data.


51
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:30,183 line:-1
To return this Mac to service,
select it in Configurator


52
00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:35.255 line:-1 position:50%
and choose Revive from
the Advanced Actions menu.


53
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:40,093 line:-1
This will bring the Mac
back to life.


54
00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.229 line:-1 position:50%
It is important to use
the correct port


55
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:45,565 line:-1
on your MacBook Air
with Apple silicon,


56
00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:48.001 line:-1 position:50%
or a Mac Mini,


57
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,837 line:-1
or a MacBook Pro.


58
00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.939 line:-1 position:50%
And note
that the port is different


59
00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.109 line:-1 position:50%
on your MacBook Pro
with the T2 Chip.


60
00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.712 line:-1 position:50%
Let’s recap Restore and Revive.


61
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:03,183 line:-1
To prepare a Mac for a new user,
use Restore.


62
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.385 line:-1 position:50%
This action restores
the firmware


63
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,622 line:-1
and updates recoveryOS
to the latest version


64
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:12,059 line:-1
and erases all user data.


65
00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:13.260 line:-1 position:50%
On Apple silicon,


66
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.532 line:-1 position:50%
this also reinstalls
the latest version of macOS.


67
00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:23.303 line:-1 position:50%
If you have a Mac that is unable
to boot, use Revive.


68
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,939 position:50%
Revive updates the firmware
and the recoveryOS


69
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:30,977 position:50%
to the latest version
while preserving user data.


70
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,681 position:50%
And remember, it’s essential to
use the correct port on your Mac


71
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,250 position:50%
when restoring or reviving it.


72
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,653 line:-1
For more information
on restoring a Mac,


73
00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:43.290 line:-1 position:50%
please refer
to the Configurator user guide.


74
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.227 line:-1 position:50%
Configurator has served us well
in helping to erase and restore


75
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:51.832 line:-1 position:50%
iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV
devices quickly.


76
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,333 line:-1
Now it can do the same


77
00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:57.204 line:-1 position:50%
for a Mac with Apple silicon
or T2 chip.


78
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:00,707 line:-1
Let’s look at another way
Configurator can be a lifesaver


79
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:05,645 line:-1
for organizations that need
to manage lots of Mac computers.


80
00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:08.482 line:-1 position:50%
A Mac purchased
directly from Apple,


81
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:13,286 line:-1
participating Apple authorized
resellers, and cellular carriers


82
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,755 line:-1
can be assigned
to your organization


83
00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:19.659 line:-1 position:50%
in Apple Business Manager
or Apple School Manager.


84
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,762 line:-1
And having the Mac assigned
to your organization


85
00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:27.000 line:-1 position:50%
provides access to some key
device management features.


86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,972 line:-1
For example, automated device
enrollment enables your users


87
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:35,642 line:-1
to enroll in your organization’s
MDM solution


88
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:40,580 line:-1
with the flow integrated right
into Setup Assistant in macOS.


89
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,418 line:-1
Also Automated Device Enrollment
paired with AutoAdvance


90
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,955 line:-1
enables a completely touch-free
configuration solution


91
00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.757 line:-1 position:50%
for Mac computers


92
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:55,128 line:-1
by just connecting
to power and ethernet.


93
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,198 line:-1
The Mac is enrolled
in your MDM Server,


94
00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:01.701 line:-1 position:50%
automatically configured
to your specifications,


95
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:05,138 line:-1
and left ready for use
in your organization.


96
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,040 line:-1
But if the Mac wasn’t purchased


97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,576 line:-1
through one of Apple’s
supported channels


98
00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:12.345 line:-1 position:50%
and not assigned
to your organization,


99
00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:15.916 line:-1 position:50%
you cannot take advantage
of these great features.


100
00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:20.187 line:-1 position:50%
Configurator has long provided
a way to assign iPhone,


101
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:24,024 line:-1
iPad, and Apple TV devices
to your organization


102
00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:27.527 line:-1 position:50%
in Apple Business Manager
or Apple School Manager,


103
00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:32.165 line:-1 position:50%
even if they were not purchased
through an official channel.


104
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,502 line:-1
Yet, Configurator
hasn’t provided a way


105
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,606 line:-1
to assign a Mac purchased
outside an official channel,


106
00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:41.441 line:-1 position:50%
until now.


107
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:45.612 line:-1 position:50%
Today,
I am very excited to introduce


108
00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:48.748 line:-1 position:50%
Apple Configurator for iPhone.


109
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,417 line:-1
This new app makes it easy


110
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,653 line:-1
to assign a Mac
to your organization.


111
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,789 line:-1
It works like magic!


112
00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.626 line:-1 position:50%
Assign one Mac -- or 100 --
without a cable,


113
00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.828 line:-1 position:50%
using your iPhone’s camera.


114
00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:04.731 line:-1 position:50%
All you need to do
to perform this critical task


115
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,067 line:-1
is sign in with
a Managed Apple ID


116
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,803 line:-1
and point your iPhone’s camera
at an image


117
00:06:09.803 --> 00:06:12.973 line:-1 position:50%
in Setup Assistant on a Mac.


118
00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:15.442 line:-1 position:50%
The Managed Apple ID
must have at least


119
00:06:15.442 --> 00:06:18.945 line:-1 position:50%
the device enrollment manager
role in your organization.


120
00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:21.615 line:-1 position:50%
Let me walk you through
how it works.


121
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,784 line:-1
The app has just
two main buttons.


122
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,888 line:-1
The first button is Settings.


123
00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.725 line:-1 position:50%
It allows you to choose
the network configuration


124
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,928 line:-1
the Mac should use
to connect to Wi-Fi,


125
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:38,064 line:-1
if it is not already connected
over Ethernet.


126
00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.468 line:-1 position:50%
The easiest option is to share
the current Wi-Fi network


127
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:44,070 line:-1
that your iPhone
is connected to.


128
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.873 line:-1 position:50%
However, not all networks
are shareable.


129
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,142 line:-1
If you need the Mac
to connect to a network


130
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,944 line:-1
that is not shareable,


131
00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:53.213 line:-1 position:50%
you can choose
a configuration profile


132
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:56,316 line:-1
with the Wi-Fi payload
that the Mac should use.


133
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:59,052 line:-1
To assign a Mac
to your organization,


134
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:02,956 line:-1
simply start up the Mac
and select the language.


135
00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:06.726 line:-1 position:50%
When the Mac asks you to select
your country or region,


136
00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:10.130 line:-1 position:50%
bring the iPhone running
Configurator near the Mac,


137
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.466 line:-1 position:50%
wait for the animation
to appear on the Mac,


138
00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:17.270 line:-1 position:50%
then center the animation in the
viewfinder of iPhone’s camera.


139
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.674 line:-1 position:50%
Wait for the message that says
“Paired Successfully”.


140
00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:23.343 line:-1 position:50%
[PAIRING CHIME]
Boom! That’s it.


141
00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:26.913 line:-1 position:50%
Once paired, Configurator sends
all the required information


142
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:31,951 line:-1
to the Mac to assign itself
to your organization.


143
00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.354 line:-1 position:50%
The other button allows you
to view the status


144
00:07:34.354 --> 00:07:37.691 line:-1 position:50%
of each assigned Mac.


145
00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:41.394 line:-1 position:50%
Status provides a report
of nearby Mac computers


146
00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:44.431 line:-1 position:50%
that you can assign
to your organization


147
00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:51.338 line:-1 position:50%
and the ones
that have already been assigned.


148
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,107 line:-1
Once the Mac is assigned
to your organization,


149
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,275 line:-1
the next step


150
00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:59.346 line:-1 position:50%
is to configure automated
device enrollment settings.


151
00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:02.115 line:-1 position:50%
To do this, sign into
Apple Business Manager


152
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,684 line:-1
or Apple School Manager,


153
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,087 line:-1
move the newly assigned Mac


154
00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:11.825 line:-1 position:50%
from the Apple Configurator 2
MDM server


155
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:13.960 line:-1 position:50%
to the MDM server
that will deliver


156
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,964 line:-1
the correct automated
device enrollment settings.


157
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,500 line:-1
The next time the Mac restarts,


158
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,571 line:-1
it will download its new
enrollment settings


159
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:29,476 line:-1
and enroll itself
