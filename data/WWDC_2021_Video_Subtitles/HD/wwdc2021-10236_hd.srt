[David] Hi, my name is David,
and I'm an engineer


4
00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:16.116 line:-2 align:center
on the Documentation Tools team
here at Apple.


5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,252 line:-2
In this session,
you'll learn about


6
00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.654 line:-1 align:center
hosting DocC documentation


7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,357 line:-2
and automating
documentation builds.


8
00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:28.028 line:-2 align:center
First, I'll talk about
building documentation in Xcode


9
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,029 line:-1
and how you can host


10
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,399 line:-2
the built documentation archives
on a server.


11
00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.635 line:-1 align:center
Next, I'll go into more detail


12
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,737 line:-1
of how documentation builds work


13
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.706 line:-2 align:center
and how you can automate
building documentation.


14
00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.075 line:-1 align:center
Throughout this talk,


15
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,344 line:-2
I'll be showing you
SlothCreator,


16
00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:47.247 line:-2 align:center
a project that my colleagues
and I have been working on.


17
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:51,051 line:-2
We made a website
to help people get started.


18
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,053 line:-2
And now, we're really excited
about using


19
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,389 line:-2
the new documentation features
in Xcode


20
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,491 line:-2
to build a version
of our documentation


21
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,493 line:-2
that we can host
right on our website.


22
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,662 line:-2
That's going
to make it even easier


23
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,931 line:-1
for people to get started.


24
00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:06.800 line:-2 align:center
So let's look at how
we can accomplish that.


25
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,937 line:-1
The new documentation features


26
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.906 line:-1 align:center
in Xcode 13 makes it really easy


27
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.274 line:-1 align:center
to build documentation


28
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,911 line:-2
for your Swift frameworks,
libraries, and packages.


29
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,380 line:-2
You can start
using it right away


30
00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:21.882 line:-1 align:center
without any setup


31
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,750 line:-2
and then expand
your documentation


32
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,153 line:-2
with additional material
over time.


33
00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:28.989 line:-1 align:center
And it's just as easy


34
00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:30.824 line:-1 align:center
to export your documentation


35
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,793 line:-2
from the Developer
Documentation window.


36
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,530 line:-2
You can share
the exported documentation


37
00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:37.965 line:-1 align:center
archive with others


38
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:41,668 line:-2
so that they can import and read
the documentation in Xcode,


39
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:45,305 line:-2
or you can host the
documentation archive online.


40
00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.643 line:-2 align:center
If you want to learn more
about documentation in Xcode


41
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,613 line:-2
and about authoring
documentation for your symbols,


42
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,815 line:-1
my colleagues Victoria and Ethan


43
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,850 line:-1
talk about just that in the


44
00:01:56.884 --> 00:02:00.454 line:-2 align:center
"Meet DocC documentation
in Xcode" session.


45
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,290 line:-2
In the second half
of this presentation,


46
00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:06.093 line:-2 align:center
I'll talk about how you can
automate building documentation


47
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,661 line:-1
on the command line.


48
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,695 line:-1
But for now,


49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,364 line:-2
I'll use the documentation
archive


50
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,700 line:-2
that I exported from Xcode
to host on our server.


51
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,372 line:-2
The documentation archive
itself is a container


52
00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:19.840 line:-1 align:center
that holds all the data


53
00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.576 line:-2 align:center
to both
read the documentation in Xcode


54
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,344 line:-1
and to host it online.


55
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,981 line:-2
It is structured
as a single page


56
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,783 line:-1
Vue.js web app


57
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,784 line:-1
that's used to render


58
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,520 line:-2
both your reference
documentation and articles


59
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,456 line:-2
and your rich
and interactive tutorials.


60
00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.027 line:-2 align:center
There are
two different types of requests


61
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.562 line:-1 align:center
that the server needs to handle


62
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:44,331 line:-2
to host
the documentation archive.


63
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,935 line:-2
Requests for documentation
and tutorial pages


64
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,103 line:-2
where the request URL
starts with


65
00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:54.208 line:-1 align:center
/documentation/ or /tutorials/


66
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:57.010 line:-2 align:center
and requests
for additional files and data


67
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,079 line:-1
that is loaded by the web app,


68
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,482 line:-2
where the request URL
matches the relative file path


69
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,152 line:-2
for one of the files
in the documentation archive.


70
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,522 line:-2
Let's look at an example
of the requests


71
00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:09.990 line:-1 align:center
that make up a page


72
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,626 line:-2
and how the server
should respond to them.


73
00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:17.431 line:-2 align:center
When a developer goes to read
your hosted documentation


74
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,067 line:-1
and the browser requests a page,


75
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.272 line:-2 align:center
if the request starts with
/documentation/ or /tutorials/


76
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,609 line:-2
then the server should respond
with the index.html file


77
00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:31.512 line:-2 align:center
that's located
in the documentation archive.


78
00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:35.382 line:-2 align:center
That file references
CSS and JavaScript


79
00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.251 line:-2 align:center
within
the documentation archive,


80
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,487 line:-2
which the browser requests
to load the rest of the web app.


81
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,958 line:-1
Once that is loaded,


82
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,561 line:-2
the web app requests
the content for that page


83
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:51,131 line:-2
and any images or other media
that it references.


84
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:53,967 line:-1
Both the files


85
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.403 line:-2 align:center
that is referenced
by the index.html file


86
00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:59.606 line:-2 align:center
and the content and media
that is loaded by the web app


87
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.442 line:-2 align:center
use request URLs that match the
folder structure


88
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,444 line:-1
of the documentation archive.


89
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,248 line:-2
Now that you've seen
how the hosting server


90
00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:10.617 line:-2 align:center
needs to respond
to incoming requests,


91
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:13.020 line:-1 align:center
let's look at that in a demo.


92
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,755 line:-2
Many of you
may already have a server


93
00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:16.490 line:-1 align:center
that hosts your website.


94
00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:19.092 line:-2 align:center
For our project,
we're using an Apache server,


95
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:22,429 line:-2
but you can use any server
that allows for custom routing.


96
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,233 line:-2
This is our website
about SlothCreator.


97
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,235 line:-2
We've added this
"Read Documentation" button


98
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.804 line:-2 align:center
below the introductory text
in the center of the page,


99
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,273 line:-2
but the button
doesn't work just yet.


100
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,908 line:-1
So let's fix that.


101
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,212 line:-2
I've already copied
the documentation archive


102
00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:40.914 line:-2 align:center
into the directory
where we're hosting our website


103
00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:43.584 line:-2 align:center
and added
an empty .htaccess file.


104
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,253 line:-2
But I haven't set up
any of the routing in it.


105
00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:52.125 line:-2 align:center
There are two routing rules
that I need to add:


106
00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.462 line:-2 align:center
one for the documentation
and tutorial pages


107
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,632 line:-2
and one for the additional files
and data.


108
00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.802 line:-1 align:center
For the first rule,


109
00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.270 line:-1 align:center
the pattern that I want to match


110
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,441 line:-2
is any URL that starts with
"documentation" or "tutorials"


111
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,743 line:-1
as its first path component.


112
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,313 line:-2
Any request
that matches this pattern,


113
00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:16.149 line:-2 align:center
I want to reroute
to the index.html file


114
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,185 line:-2
within the documentation
archive.


115
00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:21.989 line:-2 align:center
Lastly,
I'll end the rule with a flag


116
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,624 line:-1
to stop evaluating rules


117
00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:26.159 line:-2 align:center
if the request
matches this rule.


118
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,295 line:-1
For the second rule,


119
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,831 line:-2
I'm going to be more explicit
about the pattern.


120
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,535 line:-2
Since we're also hosting
our website with this server,


121
00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:35.936 line:-2 align:center
we don't want
to reroute requests


122
00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.640 line:-2 align:center
for the website to files
in the documentation archive.


123
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:45,212 line:-2
If I look inside
of the documentation archive,


124
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,548 line:-2
you can see
that there are a handful


125
00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:49.416 line:-1 align:center
of top-level files and folders


126
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,652 line:-1
that I can match in a pattern.


127
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,721 line:-2
So I'll add a pattern
that matches all of those.


128
00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:00.027 line:-1 align:center
In this case, the request URL


129
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,362 line:-2
is a relative file path
for one of the files


130
00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:04.498 line:-1 align:center
in the documentation archive,


131
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.634 line:-2 align:center
so I'll reroute the request
to the matched pattern


132
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:11,705 line:-2
but prefixed
with SlothCreator.doccarchive.


133
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:12,973 line:-1
And just like before,


134
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:16,577 line:-2
I added the same flag
to stop evaluating rules.


135
00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:19.913 line:-1 align:center
Now, if I reload the webpage


136
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,149 line:-2
and click on
the documentation link,


137
00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:24.084 line:-2 align:center
you'll see
that the server now hosts


138
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,387 line:-2
both our website
and our documentation.


139
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.958 line:-1 align:center
The main SlothCreator page


140
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,060 line:-2
groups important symbols
into topics


141
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,596 line:-1
related to higher level tasks.


142
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,535 line:-2
And each of those
group related symbols


143
00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.071 line:-1 align:center
into more specific topics.


144
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:54,281 line:-2
DocC comes
with a built-in, clean design


145
00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:57.384 line:-2 align:center
that's made to fit in well
with a variety of projects.


146
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,187 line:-2
This makes it really easy
to have good-looking,


147
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,689 line:-2
elegant documentation
for your projects,


148
00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:05.492 line:-2 align:center
like our SlothCreator
documentation here.


149
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,762 line:-2
Now that we host
a copy of our documentation


150
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,297 line:-1
on our website,


151
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,865 line:-1
let's look at how to automate


152
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:15,135 line:-2
building and updating
the documentation archive.


153
00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:17.204 line:-2 align:center
To do that,
I'm going to write a script


154
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,706 line:-1
that calls xcodebuild.


155
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.742 line:-2 align:center
Once I have a script
that does this,


156
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,911 line:-2
I can run it whenever
new changes are made


157
00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:25.679 line:-1 align:center
so that the hosted documentation


158
00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.682 line:-1 align:center
is always up to date.


159
00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:30.651 line:-1 align:center
New in Xcode 13,


160
00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:33.220 line:-2 align:center
you can build documentation
on the command line


161
00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:36.723 line:-2 align:center
with xcodebuild's
new docbuild action.


162
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,862 line:-2
When you build documentation
in Xcode or xcodebuild,


163
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,564 line:-1
it works like a standard build


164
00:07:43.597 --> 00:07:45.799 line:-1 align:center
that also builds documentation.


165
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,902 line:-1
During the build,


166
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,939 line:-2
the Swift compiler
gathers detailed information


167
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,775 line:-2
about all the public symbols,
their relationships,


168
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,144 line:-2
and in-source
documentation comments


169
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:00,480 line:-2
and passes this
as a file called a symbol graph


170
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,649 line:-1
to the documentation compiler


171
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,852 line:-2
to produce
a documentation archive


172
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,587 line:-1
with all the necessary data


173
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,022 line:-2
to both read the documentation
in Xcode


174
00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:11.491 line:-1 align:center
and to host it online.


175
00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:14.795 line:-2 align:center
If the target has an associated
documentation catalog


176
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:19,299 line:-2
with additional articles, media,
or tutorials for your project,


177
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.034 line:-1 align:center
then the documentation compiler


178
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,070 line:-2
is going to combine
all of that content


179
00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:24.471 line:-1 align:center
with the symbol information


180
00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:26.974 line:-2 align:center
when it produces
the documentation archive.


181
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,077 line:-1
If you want to learn more


182
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,379 line:-2
about documentation catalogs,
check out


183
00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:36.450 line:-2 align:center
the "Elevate your DocC
documentation in Xcode" session


184
00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:38.585 line:-1 align:center
where my colleagues Bea and Jack


185
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,021 line:-2
talk about the different types
of documentation


186
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,723 line:-2
and how you can leverage
each of them


187
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,258 line:-1
to offer developers a great way


188
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,693 line:-1
for learning about your project.


189
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,165 line:-2
Building documentation doesn't
just apply to your targets.


190
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,702 line:-2
If your target has dependencies
to other Swift frameworks,


191
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,704 line:-1
libraries, or packages,


192
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:01,208 line:-2
then the same process is applied
to all of those as well


193
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:04,211 line:-2
so that you get all the relevant
documentation for your project


194
00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:06.480 line:-1 align:center
all in one place.


195
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,217 line:-2
Since I'm looking to automate
building and updating


196
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.686 line:-2 align:center
our hosted documentation
with a script,


197
00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.254 line:-1 align:center
xcodebuild on the command line


198
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,256 line:-1
is going to be perfect for that.


199
00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:21.094 line:-2 align:center
The new docbuild action
in xcodebuild


200
00:09:21.128 --> 00:09:23.697 line:-2 align:center
works just like
the default build action,


201
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,699 line:-2
but it also
builds documentation.


202
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,403 line:-1
Like the build action,


203
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,605 line:-2
you pass it the scheme
that you want to build


204
00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:34.474 line:-2 align:center
and the project or workspace
that it's a part of.


205
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,511 line:-1
You can also call xcodebuild


206
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,113 line:-2
from within the directory
that contains your project,


207
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,149 line:-1
workspace, or Swift package


208
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,585 line:-1
and only pass it the scheme.


209
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,720 line:-2
Depending on your project
and scheme,


210
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,488 line:-1
you may want to pass other flags


211
00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:51.792 line:-2 align:center
such as sdk, destination,
or configuration


212
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,961 line:-2
to customize
how your project is built.


213
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,631 line:-1
It's not required to do so.


214
00:09:57.664 --> 00:09:59.533 line:-2 align:center
But to make
it more easy to follow,


215
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,503 line:-2
I'll specify a custom
derivedDataPath,


216
00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:05.138 line:-2 align:center
where the build products
and the built documentation


217
00:10:05.172 --> 00:10:06.974 line:-1 align:center
will be written.


218
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,543 line:-1
After the build has completed,


219
00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:12.346 line:-2 align:center
I can find all of the built
documentation archives


220
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,983 line:-2
using
the .doccarchive file extension


221
00:10:16.016 --> 00:10:17.217 line:-1 align:center
and copy each of them


222
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:19.786 line:-2 align:center
to another location
or to another machine.


223
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,957 line:-2
Let's take a look
at that in a demo.


224
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:28,262 line:-2
This is our hosted documentation
from before.


225
00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:30.797 line:-2 align:center
It groups related symbols
into topics


226
00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:32.299 line:-1 align:center
so that it's easy for developers


227
00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:35.169 line:-2 align:center
to find the core types
for a specific task.


228
00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:40.174 line:-2 align:center
In the time since
we built this version,


229
00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:42.142 line:-2 align:center
my colleagues have added
some new articles


230
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:45,946 line:-2
and tutorials that appear
in the Essentials section.


231
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,116 line:-2
So now is a great time for me
to write that automation script


232
00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:50.884 line:-2 align:center
that builds
the latest documentation


233
00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:51.952 line:-1 align:center
and updates our website.


234
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,822 line:-1
Like you just saw,


235
00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:57.124 line:-1 align:center
we build documentation


236
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:01,228 line:-2
by calling xcodebuild's
docbuild action


237
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:03.997 line:-2 align:center
and update our website
by finding and copying


238
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,466 line:-2
the documentation archive into
the directory


239
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,936 line:-2
where we're hosting
our website from.


240
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,174 line:-2
I already know what scheme
I need to pass


241
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:18,612 line:-2
because it's the same as I see
in the scheme selector in Xcode.


242
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,014 line:-2
If I didn't already
have Xcode open,


243
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:24,151 line:-2
I could also run
xcodebuild -list


244
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,955 line:-2
on the command line to list
all of the available schemes.


245
00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:32.059 line:-2 align:center
Again,
the custom derivedDataPath


246
00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:34.828 line:-2 align:center
is not required,
but it makes it easier to follow


247
00:11:34.862 --> 00:11:38.432 line:-2 align:center
where the built documentation
is written and found.


248
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,238 line:-1
After the build has completed,


249
00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:46.507 line:-2 align:center
I can find all of the
documentation archives


250
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,475 line:-2
and copy each of them
into the directory


251
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:51,178 line:-2
where we're hosting
our website from.


252
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,148 line:-2
And with that done,
I'm ready to run the script.


253
00:12:02.823 --> 00:12:04.591 line:-1 align:center
Now, if I refresh,


254
00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:06.860 line:-2 align:center
you can see
the added article and tutorial


255
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,695 line:-1
in the Essentials section.


256
00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:11.064 line:-1 align:center
With these latest changes,


257
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,400 line:-2
our documentation
looks more complete.


258
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,536 line:-2
And people
who are new to SlothCreator


259
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,437 line:-2
have a great place
to get started,


260
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.673 line:-2 align:center
whether they prefer
the content of an article


261
00:12:25.712 --> 00:12:29.183 line:-2 align:center
or the step-by-step instructions
in one of our tutorials.


262
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,524 line:-2
Now, updating
our hosted documentation


263
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:40,561 line:-1
is as easy as running a script.


264
00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:42.996 line:-2 align:center
And if we run it
as part of a post-merge hook


265
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.332 line:-2 align:center
on our continuous
integration server,


266
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,367 line:-2
then we can ensure
that our hosted documentation


267
00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:49.736 line:-1 align:center
always stays up to date.


268
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,175 line:-2
To recap what we talked about
in this session,


269
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,044 line:-2
you can share
documentation archives


270
00:12:57.077 --> 00:12:58.378 line:-1 align:center
or host them online


271
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:00,414 line:-2
to give
a great documentation experience


272
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,216 line:-1
to consumers of your framework,


273
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:05,586 line:-2
even before they've started
using it in Xcode.


274
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,121 line:-2
And building documentation
on the command line


275
00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:10.290 line:-2 align:center
allows you
to include documentation


276
00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:12.860 line:-1 align:center
in your automation workflows.


277
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:17,397 line:-2
If you want to learn more
about DocC documentation,


278
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:19,900 line:-2
"Meet DocC documentation
in Xcode"


279
00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:21.602 line:-1 align:center
is a fantastic introduction


280
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,438 line:-2
to the new documentation
features in Xcode.


281
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,275 line:-2
"Elevate your DocC documentation
in Xcode"


282
00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.210 line:-2 align:center
goes deep into how
you can enhance


283
00:13:30.244 --> 00:13:33.814 line:-2 align:center
your documentation
with DocC catalogs.


284
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,084 line:-2
And "Build interactive tutorials
using DocC"


285
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,119 line:-2
details how you can structure
your ideas


286
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,657 line:-2
and create amazing tutorials
for your project.


287
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.791 line:-1 align:center
Thank you for watching.
