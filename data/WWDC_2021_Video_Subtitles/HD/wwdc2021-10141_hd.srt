Naiwei Zheng: Hello.
Welcome to WWDC.


7
00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.215 line:-1 position:50%
My name is Zheng Naiwei.


8
00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.151 line:-1 position:50%
I'm from Apple's
HLS Streaming Team.


9
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.722 line:-1 position:50%
Today I'm going to talk about
a new feature in HLS


10
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,590 line:-1
called Content Steering,


11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,995 line:-1
and how it can improve
global streaming availability.


12
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:32,065 line:-1
Today's network connectivity
is at global scale.


13
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,501 line:-1
Streaming media providers
deliver their contents


14
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,203 line:-1
all around the world.


15
00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:39.573 line:-1 position:50%
However, delivering contents
at the global scale comes with


16
00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:44.077 line:-1 position:50%
enormous amount of challenges
the industry has to solve.


17
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,513 line:-1
We, HLS Streaming Team at Apple,


18
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,283 line:-1
also recognize
these challenging problems


19
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,986 line:-1
and are constantly working
to provide solutions.


20
00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:57.157 line:-1 position:50%
Today, we will be focusing on
the problem of availability.


21
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,960 line:-1
Specifically,
network congestion mitigation


22
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.362 line:-1 position:50%
and error recovery.


23
00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.598 line:-1 position:50%
To help us understand
these problems,


24
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,334 line:-1
let's take a look at an example.


25
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:11,004 line:-1
Let's assume a popular
streaming provider in Asia


26
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.073 line:-1 position:50%
deploys its CDN infrastructures


27
00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.075 line:-1 position:50%
in the following
three countries:


28
00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.811 line:-1 position:50%
China, Japan, and Singapore.


29
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,614 line:0
In this graph, we are showing
a state where everything


30
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,950 position:50%
is working in perfect condition.


31
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,653 line:0
We have users in China
streaming from Chinese CDN


32
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:31,124 position:50%
and users from Japan
streaming from Japanese CDN,


33
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:35,162 position:50%
and both CDN networks
are performing at capable level.


34
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,632 position:50%
Now, let's introduce
some change.


35
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,735 position:50%
Let's say a while later,
users in China


36
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:45,272 position:50%
streaming from the Chinese CDN
has greatly increased,


37
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:49,743 position:50%
to a degree that CDN network
is becoming overloading.


38
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:52,279 position:50%
With the HLS technologies
we had,


39
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,448 position:50%
it's difficult to fully address
this issue


40
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,483 position:50%
of network congestion.


41
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:00,120 line:0
Even though we could assign
new users to different CDN,


42
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,023 line:0
it's, however, difficult
to instruct existing clients


43
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,459 line:0
to use a different CDN,


44
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,328 line:0
and existing traffic
will continuously overload


45
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,529 position:50%
the current CDN.


46
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,199 line:0
With our new HLS
Content Steering feature,


47
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,468 position:50%
content providers
can solve this problem


48
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,504 line:0
by hosting their own
steering server.


49
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:21,608 position:50%
It establishes a side channel
with all latest HLS clients


50
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,778 position:50%
to update them
with the latest CDN policy.


51
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:28,648 position:50%
For example, it can send
a policy update to 30 percent


52
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:33,587 position:50%
of the existing clients in China
to switch to Japanese CDN.


53
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:36,156 position:50%
And the clients receiving
the policy update


54
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,159 position:50%
will honor the change and
redirect their network traffics


55
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,428 position:50%
to the Japanese CDN.


56
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:46,233 position:50%
Now the network congestion
in the Chinese CDN is mitigated.


57
00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.368 line:-1 position:50%
But network congestion
is only one


58
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,004 line:-1
of the many
availability problems.


59
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,241 line:-1
What happens when
there's a network outage?


60
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,343 position:50%
Let's take another example.


61
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:01,048 position:50%
Say the network path from users
in Japan to the Japanese CDN


62
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,117 line:0
has experienced
a regional outage.


63
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,253 line:0
With HLS technologies we had,


64
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:09,489 position:50%
content providers can list
our fallback variant streams


65
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,091 line:0
in master playlist,


66
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,160 position:50%
so clients can try
to walk through the list


67
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,229 line:0
until it reaches a working CDN.


68
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.398 line:-1 position:50%
But this approach
is preliminary in the sense


69
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,934 line:-1
that content provider
is unable to change


70
00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:24.037 line:-1 position:50%
the ordering or priorities
of the CDNs listed


71
00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.107 line:-1 position:50%
in the master playlist
in real time.


72
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,843 line:-1
However, with the help
of the steering server,


73
00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:33.346 line:-1 position:50%
clients will be updated
with the latest CDN priorities


74
00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.082 line:-1 position:50%
at near real time.


75
00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:38.652 line:-1 position:50%
Let's rewind a bit to see
how it can facilitate the client


76
00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:41.822 line:-1 position:50%
with more efficient
error recovery.


77
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,657 position:50%
Before the network outage,


78
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,659 position:50%
clients in Japan
periodically pull


79
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,930 position:50%
for CDN priority list updates
from the steering server.


80
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,299 position:50%
Let's say in the latest update,


81
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,037 position:50%
clients in Japan received
the following CDN priority list


82
00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:00,040 position:50%
where the Japanese CDN
being most preferred,


83
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,243 position:50%
following Singapore
and then China.


84
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:09,015 position:50%
Currently, users in Japan are
streaming from the Japanese CDN.


85
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,985 position:50%
Now when the network
outage happens,


86
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,721 position:50%
the Japanese CDN
will be marked as penalized


87
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,857 line:0
from the priority list.


88
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:20,694 position:50%
The client will move on to the
next CDN in the priority list,


89
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,630 position:50%
which in this case,
the CDN in Singapore,


90
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,466 line:0
and redirect
their network traffics.


91
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,503 position:50%
Now the users in Japan
will be able to continue


92
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,973 line:0
watching their shows
without interrupt.


93
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:36,510 line:-1
What our example showed you
is just a high-level overview


94
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,846 line:-1
of our new HLS feature,
Content Steering.


95
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,782 line:-1
Now let's dive deeper
to show you how to integrate


96
00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.919 line:-1 position:50%
this amazing feature
into your streams.


97
00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.556 line:-1 position:50%
It's just a simple listing
of different CDN URLs


98
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,392 line:-1
duplicating all
available variants.


99
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,428 line:-1
As explained before,
a playlist like this


100
00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:59.432 line:-1 position:50%
has a constant and final
ordering of CDN priorities.


101
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,902 line:-1
Content providers
cannot change it later


102
00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:03.837 line:-1 position:50%
during the playback.


103
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,740 line:-1
Now let's see how to add
Content Steering support


104
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.544 line:-1 position:50%
to this playlist.


105
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:14,181 line:-1
You may be surprised how little
the change introduced.


106
00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:16.483 line:-1 position:50%
In fact, the changes
are backward-compatible


107
00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.718 line:-1 position:50%
with current HLS clients.


108
00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:21.621 line:-1 position:50%
Let's walk through
the additions.


109
00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:24.457 line:-1 position:50%
Most notably,
we now group variant streams


110
00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:28.295 line:-1 position:50%
into different pathways
by the PATHWAY-ID attributes


111
00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:30.330 line:-1 position:50%
on each variant stream,


112
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,935 line:-1
where each pathway typically
corresponds to one CDN.


113
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:39,806 line:-1
In this example, we group the
variant streams into pathway CN,


114
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:44,177 line:-1
JP, and SG, representing
CDNs in China, Japan,


115
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,780 line:-1
and Singapore, respectively.


116
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.149 line:-1 position:50%
However, a pathway
may contain variant streams


117
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:54,554 line:-1
from different CDNs to enable
more advanced use case.


118
00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.623 line:-1 position:50%
When the client selects
a pathway,


119
00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:59.059 line:-1 position:50%
only the variant streams
from that pathway


120
00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:01.595 line:-1 position:50%
is eligible
for variant selection.


121
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:05,665 line:-1
The PATHWAY-ID attribute on
the new CONTENT-STEERING tag


122
00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:10.103 line:-1 position:50%
specifies the initial pathway
to use at playback startup.


123
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,305 line:-1
So, in this case,
the client will only choose


124
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,508 line:-1
from variant streams
belonging to the CN pathway


125
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,645 line:-1
at the initial playback.


126
00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:20.413 line:-1 position:50%
The SERVER-URI attribute


127
00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:23.783 line:-1 position:50%
specifies where is
the Content Steering server.


128
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,052 line:-1
Clients will pull for
Content Steering updates


129
00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.388 line:-1 position:50%
from this URI.


130
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,391 line:-1
But what if your playlist
contains media groups?


131
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.592 line:-1 position:50%
No problem.


132
00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:36.796 line:-1 position:50%
It's still very simple
to enable Content Steering.


133
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,933 line:-1
All you have to do is to
duplicate the media groups


134
00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:45.071 line:-1 position:50%
for each pathway and assign them
with unique GROUP-IDs.


135
00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.241 line:-1 position:50%
For example,
the audio group in this playlist


136
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.977 line:-1 position:50%
is being duplicated
for each pathway,


137
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,981 line:-1
with the GROUP-ID set to
CN-audio for the CN pathway


138
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,916 line:-1
and et cetera.


139
00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.552 line:-1 position:50%
When an HLS client
loaded a master playlist


140
00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:01.321 line:-1 position:50%
with Content Steering tag,


141
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:05,558 line:-1
it triggers a slightly different
startup routine.


142
00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:10.196 line:-1 position:50%
First, when it performs initial
variant stream selection,


143
00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:14.334 line:-1 position:50%
it will only use variant streams
from the initial pathway.


144
00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:17.003 line:-1 position:50%
Then it will load
and start playing


145
00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:22.075 line:-1 position:50%
the selected variant stream
and its media segments as usual.


146
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:25,011 line:-1
But in parallel to the normal
playback routine,


147
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:26.613 line:-1 position:50%
the client will start making


148
00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:30.650 line:-1 position:50%
periodic Steering Manifest
requests in background.


149
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.018 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a look of what


150
00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:36.056 line:-1 position:50%
a Steering Manifest request
looks like.


151
00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:38.692 line:-1 position:50%
It's just a simple
HTTP GET request


152
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:42,462 line:-1
sent to this resolved URI
from the SERVER-URI attribute


153
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.465 line:-1 position:50%
based on
the master playlist URL.


154
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,602 line:-1
The steering server will respond
with a Steering Manifest.


155
00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:53.573 line:-1 position:50%
Let's dissect its format
with an example.


156
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,910 line:-1
The Steering Manifest
is a JSON document.


157
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.413 line:-1 position:50%
The steering server can craft
customized Steering Manifests


158
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,048 line:-1
for each client.


159
00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:04.818 line:-1 position:50%
This gives steering server
great potential


160
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,188 line:-1
in shaping its managed
network traffic.


161
00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:11.725 line:-1 position:50%
The most important property
in this Steering Manifest


162
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,661 line:-1
is the PATHWAY-PRIORITY field.


163
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:18.531 line:-1 position:50%
It's a list of pathway IDs
ordered by their priorities,


164
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:21.434 line:-1 position:50%
with the first being
the most preferred.


165
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,203 line:-1
Here in this example,


166
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,940 line:-1
we have a priority of CN pathway
being most preferred,


167
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.744 line:-1 position:50%
followed by JP and then SG.


168
00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:32.946 line:-1 position:50%
Upon receiving
the Steering Manifest


169
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,982 line:-1
from the steering server,
the client will perform


170
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,018 line:-1
Content Steering evaluation
to determine whether


171
00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:42.222 line:-1 position:50%
to switch to
a different pathway.


172
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,225 line:-1
First, the client will exclude
variant streams


173
00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:47.861 line:-1 position:50%
ineligible for selection.


174
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.497 line:-1 position:50%
This includes
penalized variant streams


175
00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:52.799 line:-1 position:50%
due to network errors.


176
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,002 line:-1
And also, variant streams
with unsupported codecs,


177
00:08:56,002 --> 00:09:00,073 line:-1
just like usual
variant selection would do.


178
00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:03.576 line:-1 position:50%
It will select a pathway
that has at least one


179
00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:08.415 line:-1 position:50%
eligible variant streams
and has highest pathway priority


180
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,584 line:-1
among all eligible pathways.


181
00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:13.620 line:-1 position:50%
If the chosen pathway
is different


182
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.822 line:-1 position:50%
from the currently
using pathway,


183
00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:20.093 line:-1 position:50%
the client will immediately
switch to the new pathway.


184
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,695 line:0
If no suitable pathway
is chosen


185
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,565 line:0
or is already using
the chosen pathway,


186
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,033 position:50%
client will do nothing


187
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:31,237 line:0
and keep playing using
the current pathway.


188
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,306 position:50%
Finally, the client
will schedule


189
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,209 position:50%
for the next
Steering Manifest request


190
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,846 line:0
to pull for latest updates
from the steering server.


191
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,749 line:-1
So how does
this scheduling work?


192
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,518 line:-1
Let's review
the Steering Manifest.


193
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:49,923 line:-1
Notice that there's a TTL field
which specify


194
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,525 line:-1
the number of seconds
the client should wait


195
00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:56.529 line:-1 position:50%
until sending the next
Steering Manifest request.


196
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,599 line:-1
In this example,
after the client performed


197
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,801 line:-1
the Content Steering evaluation


198
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,605 line:-1
using this Steering Manifest's
pathway priority list,


199
00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.508 line:-1 position:50%
it will schedule the next
Steering Manifest request


200
00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:12.212 line:-1 position:50%
in 300 seconds,
which is five minutes.


201
00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:15.548 line:-1 position:50%
It's also worth noting that
steering server is able


202
00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:20.420 line:-1 position:50%
to change this TTL value in each
Steering Manifest response,


203
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.188 line:-1 position:50%
affecting how long the client


204
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,657 line:-1
should schedule
the next request.


205
00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:26.860 line:-1 position:50%
It's also useful
for steering server


206
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,129 line:-1
to inject some randomness
to each client's TTL value


207
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,299 line:-1
to distribute server load.


208
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,603 line:-1
In addition,
the optional RELOAD-URI field


209
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,638 line:-1
tells the clients
where to request


210
00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.007 line:-1 position:50%
the next Steering Manifest.


211
00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:43.676 line:-1 position:50%
Steering server can leverage
this field to inject


212
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:47,447 line:-1
client-specific state
or session data in the URL


213
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,884 line:-1
to be echoed back
in the next request.


214
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,453 line:-1
Now you have seen
the major technical details


215
00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:55.221 line:-1 position:50%
of Content Steering.


216
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,724 line:-1
Let's go back
to one of our early examples


217
00:10:57.724 --> 00:11:02.295 line:-1 position:50%
to see how it works
under the hood.


218
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,498 position:50%
Let's say in this case,
all users in China


219
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,300 line:0
have received
a Steering Manifest


220
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,304 position:50%
with the CN pathway
being most preferred,


221
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:14,707 position:50%
and the corresponding Chinese
CDN is being overloaded


222
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:18,611 position:50%
because of the increasing
number of users.


223
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,214 position:50%
So the steering server
came into action,


224
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,050 position:50%
and sending out a different
Steering Manifest


225
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,153 position:50%
to 30 percent
of the users in China,


226
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,290 position:50%
with the most preferred
pathway changed to JP.


227
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,226 line:0
After performing
a Content Steering evaluation,


228
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,528 line:0
those 30 percent
clients in China


229
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,697 line:0
will switch to the JP pathway,


230
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,467 position:50%
redirecting their network
traffics to the CDN in Japan,


231
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:47,073 line:0
resolving the network congestion
situation in Chinese CDN.


232
00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:50.777 line:-1 position:50%
To wrap up, we introduced
the new HLS feature


233
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,780 line:-1
of Content Steering,
explained how it works,


234
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.916 line:-1 position:50%
and how to integrate it
in your streams.


235
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,519 line:-1
With this amazing feature,
you will be able


236
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,022 line:-1
to fine-tune your global
streaming availability.


237
00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:07.193 line:-1 position:50%

for "HLS Content Steering
Specification".


239
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,366 line:-1
I'd also like to tell you
that playlists


240
00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:16.669 line:-1 position:50%
and Steering Manifest
validation is also supported


241
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,473 line:-1
in our latest HTTP Live
Streaming Tools.


242
00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:22.575 line:-1 position:50%
I'd also like to acknowledge
feedbacks


243
00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:25.678 line:-1 position:50%
and helps we received
from industry members


244
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,848 line:-1
in the HLS Interest IETF forum.


245
00:12:28.848 --> 00:12:33.019 line:-1 position:50%
Future feedbacks and suggestions
are also welcomed.


246
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,554 line:0
And with all these in place,


247
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,690 position:50%
the HLS Content Steering
will be available to developers


248
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,628 line:0
and users in this year's
WWDC Seed builds.


249
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:45,198 line:-1
So, if you want a better
global streaming delivery


250
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,866 line:-1
with more availability,


251
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,535 line:-1
act now to integrate
HLS Content Steering


252
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,137 line:-1
in your streams


253
00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:54.207 line:-1 position:50%
and bring your customers
a better streaming experience.


254
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,842 line:-1
Thank you very much.
