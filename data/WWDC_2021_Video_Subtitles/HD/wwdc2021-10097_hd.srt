[Thalia]
Hello, my name is Thalia,


4
00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:11.778 line:-1 align:center
and I’m a designer


5
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,480 line:-1
on the Apple Design Team.


6
00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:14.414 line:-1 align:center
Today we will learn


7
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,517 line:-1
what's new in SF Symbols.


8
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:18.619 line:-1 align:center
The value of symbols


9
00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:19.853 line:-1 align:center
as one of the elements


10
00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:21.421 line:-1 align:center
of user interface design


11
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,290 line:-1
cannot be overstated.


12
00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.527 line:-2 align:center
They are the simplest form of
communication


13
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.829 line:-1 align:center
between the user and a product


14
00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.998 line:-2 align:center
and serve as little pieces
of a puzzle


15
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,566 line:-1
that aid in usability


16
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,668 line:-1
and intuitive navigation.


17
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,939 line:-2
They also make interfaces
faster to use,


18
00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.908 line:-1 align:center
helping us navigate quickly,


19
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:44,311 line:-2
as most symbols
are language-independent.


20
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,680 line:-2
They can help
communicate content


21
00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.283 line:-2 align:center
or help trigger
a specific action,


22
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.252 line:-2 align:center
and many times,
symbols help solve quite a few


23
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,688 line:-1
complex or abstract concepts.


24
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.990 line:-2 align:center
SF Symbols
brings this all together


25
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,725 line:-1
in a library of iconography


26
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,894 line:-1
designed to integrate seamlessly


27
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,263 line:-2
with all the San Francisco
font families,


28
00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:06.633 line:-2 align:center
providing a powerful
and flexible designs resource


29
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,570 line:-2
for creating experiences
on all Apple platforms.


30
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,339 line:-2
Today, we are going
to have a quick recap


31
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,341 line:-1
of the SF Symbols basics.


32
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,044 line:-1
The repertoire keeps growing,


33
00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:20.647 line:-2 align:center
so we will take a look at some
of the new symbols additions.


34
00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.650 line:-2 align:center
We have expanded
the localized symbols


35
00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:25.853 line:-2 align:center
by increasing
the script coverage.


36
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:28,655 line:-2
We will look at those
in localization.


37
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,892 line:-2
We will study
the anatomy of a symbol


38
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.327 line:-1 align:center
and learn how its structure


39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,895 line:-1
makes color possible.


40
00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:37.497 line:-1 align:center
We will discover the benefits


41
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:40.767 line:-2 align:center
of adding colors to symbols
in rendering modes.


42
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,571 line:-2
And finally,
we got some exciting updates


43
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,073 line:-1
to the SF Symbols app


44
00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.574 line:-1 align:center
and the color library,


45
00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:48.942 line:-1 align:center
so let’s get started.


46
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:52,679 line:-2
Each symbol comes
in a wide range of weights


47
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,983 line:-2
that automatically align
with text labels.


48
00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:59.553 line:-2 align:center
In iOS,
SF Symbols supports Dynamic Type


49
00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:02.990 line:-2 align:center
and the Bold Text
accessibility feature.


50
00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:06.326 line:-2 align:center
SF Symbols are also available
in three scales:


51
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.162 line:-1 align:center
small, medium, and large.


52
00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.666 line:-2 align:center
These scales maintain
the same point size,


53
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,334 line:-1
changing only their scales,


54
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,504 line:-2
with stroke thicknesses
that are optically adjusted


55
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,940 line:-2
and weight-matched
with the text.


56
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:24,211 line:-2
You also need to be aware
of two different alignments.


57
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,713 line:-1
First is the vertical alignment.


58
00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:29.349 line:-2 align:center
Symbols are automatically
vertically centered


59
00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:31.018 line:-1 align:center
to San Francisco's cap-height


60
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,187 line:-2
in all the different scales
and weights.


61
00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:35.489 line:-1 align:center
And as you may know,


62
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,025 line:-2
some symbols
have negative margins.


63
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,595 line:-2
These margins are there to aid
with horizontal alignments.


64
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,462 line:-1
That is the case


65
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,532 line:-2
for most variants with badges,
for example.


66
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,067 line:-1
When displayed in the UIs,


67
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.269 line:-2 align:center
symbols will be
horizontally centered,


68
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,205 line:-1
giving a consistent look,


69
00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:54.741 line:-2 align:center
especially when displaying
similar symbol variants.


70
00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:59.513 line:-2 align:center
If you want to learn more about
all the features in SF Symbols,


71
00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:02.716 line:-1 align:center
last year’s session from WWDC20


72
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,751 line:-1
will get you up to speed.


73
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,322 line:-2
Now let's talk
about symbol variants.


74
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,823 line:-1
A symbol is defined


75
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,392 line:-2
as a representation
of a symbolic value


76
00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:14.962 line:-2 align:center
that is used for the purpose
of communication.


77
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,763 line:-1
For example, the word "love"


78
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,732 line:-1
is represented by a heart.


79
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,768 line:-2
In UIs, a symbol
is part of a visual system


80
00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:23.303 line:-1 align:center
that conveys meaning.


81
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,539 line:-2
To enrich
this communication system,


82
00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.641 line:-2 align:center
a symbol
with the same representation


83
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,576 line:-2
can come
in many different forms.


84
00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.479 line:-1 align:center
In SF Symbols, the default,


85
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:33,714 line:-1
or universal variant,


86
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,049 line:-2
is the outlined version
of a symbol


87
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,151 line:-1
as it relates to the typography


88
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,620 line:-1
in the way that we can imagine


89
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:43,123 line:-2
the same tool
drawing the symbol and the text.


90
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,958 line:-1
In the absence of context,


91
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,894 line:-1
outlined is the default.


92
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,664 line:-2
And when we want to make
a symbol more prominent,


93
00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:52.799 line:-2 align:center
like when we want it
to have more surface area


94
00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:55.736 line:-2 align:center
to saturate with color
for the purpose of selection,


95
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,005 line:-2
the filled variant
is a great choice.


96
00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:01.074 line:-1 align:center
In SF Symbols,


97
00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:03.677 line:-2 align:center
a symbol may come
in many different forms.


98
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.947 line:-2 align:center
We have outlined
and filled variants.


99
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,649 line:-1
We also have slash variants,


100
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,284 line:-1
which are used to convey


101
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,852 line:-1
the functions of removing


102
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,088 line:-2
or displaying an item
as inactive or unavailable.


103
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,658 line:-1
We have enclosing variants


104
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,593 line:-2
that are contained
inside a shape


105
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,930 line:-2
like a circle,
square, or rectangle.


106
00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:27.267 line:-2 align:center
All these variants
help make the UIs richer


107
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,802 line:-1
and give more flexibility


108
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,938 line:-2
when setting up
visual hierarchies


109
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:34,107 line:-2
with the interface elements
and the content.


110
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,609 line:-1
A clear visual system


111
00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.678 line:-2 align:center
will go to great lengths
in reducing


112
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,246 line:-1
the appearance of complexity,


113
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.082 line:-2 align:center
even when the actions themselves
are complex.


114
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,050 line:-1
Consequently,


115
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,953 line:-2
knowing where to use
a symbol variant is essential.


116
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,055 line:-1
A filled symbol in swipe actions


117
00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:49.389 line:-1 align:center
and iOS tab bars


118
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:52,526 line:-2
give a consistent appearance
and level of emphasis,


119
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,863 line:-2
giving better control in areas
that indicate selection


120
00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:58.565 line:-2 align:center
when defined
with an accent color.


121
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,835 line:-2
A symbol inside a circle
with a filled variant


122
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:05,439 line:-2
provides better legibility
at small sizes.


123
00:05:06.273 --> 00:05:08.909 line:-2 align:center
And an outlined,
or default variant, of a symbol


124
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,446 line:-2
is great for Toolbars,
Navigation Bars, Lists


125
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,348 line:-1
and other places in the UI


126
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,484 line:-2
where symbols
are presented alongside text


127
00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:19.186 line:-1 align:center
or where symbols need to display


128
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,388 line:-1
a uniform appearance.


129
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:25,092 line:-2
When designing your own symbols,
remember to be consistent


130
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,995 line:-2
and define a system
that meets the user's needs.


131
00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:28.862 line:-1 align:center
In this way,


132
00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:30.764 line:-2 align:center
you will help perceive
visual metaphors


133
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,799 line:-2
that are directly related
to the actions


134
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,434 line:-1
that the symbols initiate


135
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,970 line:-2
or the content
the symbols represent.


136
00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:40.174 line:-2 align:center
As symbols become available
on all platforms,


137
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,476 line:-2
the SF Symbols library
keeps growing,


138
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,913 line:-2
with nearly 600 new symbols
available this year.


139
00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:49.683 line:-2 align:center
We have expanded
the Apple products and devices.


140
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,655 line:-2
And we have new additions
for video game controllers.


141
00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:58.625 line:-2 align:center
We have
some health-related symbols,


142
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,929 line:-2
with plenty of new symbols
to represent communication.


143
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.464 line:-1 align:center
And new inset symbols


144
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,133 line:-1
that are helpful for designs


145
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,968 line:-1
related to interface layout


146
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.037 line:-1 align:center
and window management.


147
00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:13.974 line:-2 align:center
We also designed
some symbols for watchOS.


148
00:06:14.975 --> 00:06:18.145 line:-2 align:center
And we have many
new objects to choose from,


149
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,215 line:-1
making SF Symbols a library


150
00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:24.551 line:-2 align:center
with more than 3,000 symbols
to choose from.


151
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,255 line:-2
Now let's talk
about localization.


152
00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:30.757 line:-2 align:center
At Apple,
we seek to make interfaces


153
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:32.392 line:-1 align:center
more inclusive and tailored


154
00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:35.629 line:-2 align:center
for international
and multicultural audiences.


155
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,232 line:-1
This year, we have expanded


156
00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:40.634 line:-1 align:center
the SF Symbols script coverage


157
00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:43.437 line:-1 align:center
with new symbols for Arabic,


158
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,938 line:-1
Hebrew,


159
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,974 line:-1
and Devanagari,


160
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,776 line:-1
and included designs for Thai,


161
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.512 line:-1 align:center
Chinese,


162
00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:53.013 line:-1 align:center
Japanese,


163
00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:54.047 line:-1 align:center
and Korean.


164
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,185 line:-1
We made it easy


165
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,487 line:-2
by making
all these localized symbols


166
00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:02.823 line:-2 align:center
and script variants
adapt automatically


167
00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:04.958 line:-2 align:center
based on
the user's device language,


168
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:07,528 line:-2
including
right-to-left writing systems.


169
00:07:07.561 --> 00:07:08.996 line:-1 align:center
If you are designing


170
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:10.163 line:-1 align:center
for left-to-right


171
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,098 line:-1
and right-to-left


172
00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:12.432 line:-1 align:center
writing systems,


173
00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:14.334 line:-1 align:center
consider the directionality


174
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:15,402 line:-1
and overall look


175
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,304 line:-1
of both localized variants


176
00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:19.273 line:-1 align:center
and be aware that in some cases,


177
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:20,574 line:-1
some symbols will not


178
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,675 line:-1
have the intended look


179
00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:22.976 line:-1 align:center
when mirrored.


180
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.977 line:-1 align:center
In this case,


181
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,245 line:-1
a new design tailored


182
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,214 line:-1
to the specific script's needs


183
00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:28.315 line:-1 align:center
will be needed,


184
00:07:28.348 --> 00:07:30.050 line:-1 align:center
like in this example.


185
00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:32.219 line:-1 align:center
If you want to learn more


186
00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:33.086 line:-1 align:center
about designing


187
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,155 line:-2
for right-to-left
writing systems,


188
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:37.524 line:-2 align:center
check out
the Human Interface Guidelines.


189
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:42,563 line:-2
Now let's study
the anatomy of a symbol.


190
00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:45.465 line:-2 align:center
Every symbol
starts with a vector point.


191
00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:48.502 line:-2 align:center
From there, we can draw
two types of segments:


192
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,537 line:-1
straight lines and curves,


193
00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:54.308 line:-2 align:center
also known
as Bézier control points.


194
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:56.877 line:-2 align:center
We define
the design source of a symbol


195
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.078 line:-1 align:center
by drawing a path


196
00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:01.381 line:-1 align:center
as a completely enclosed shape.


197
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:04,017 line:-2
Then we get to expand
the stylistic range


198
00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:06.119 line:-1 align:center
by drawing additional sources


199
00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:08.622 line:-2 align:center
and making sure
that the design sources


200
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.390 line:-1 align:center
are point compatible;


201
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:13,126 line:-2
that is, each source
has the same number


202
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.062 line:-1 align:center
of vector points.


203
00:08:15.095 --> 00:08:17.764 line:-2 align:center
Next, we interpolate
the design sources,


204
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,867 line:-1
creating instances that give us


205
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,402 line:-2
the different weights
and scales.


206
00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:23.604 line:-1 align:center
So as you can see,


207
00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:26.106 line:-2 align:center
drawing with closed paths
is really important


208
00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.342 line:-2 align:center
in order to achieve
consistent shapes,


209
00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:30.711 line:-2 align:center
which allow us to have
a lot of flexibility


210
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,779 line:-1
when creating a symbol.


211
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.781 line:-1 align:center
If you want to learn more


212
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,551 line:-2
about interpolation
and drawing symbols,


213
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:41,588 line:-2
check out this year's session
"Create Custom Symbols."


214
00:08:42.923 --> 00:08:45.926 line:-2 align:center
If you have ever drawn paths
with a pen tool,


215
00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:48.262 line:-2 align:center
you might be familiar
with strokes.


216
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:51,565 line:-2
Usually, that is the way
to give thickness to a path,


217
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:56,503 line:-2
but for SF Symbols,
we do it a bit differently.


218
00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:58.272 line:-1 align:center
If you look at it closely,


219
00:08:58.305 --> 00:09:00.407 line:-2 align:center
a stroke
is a given thickness value


220
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,143 line:-2
assigned to precisely
follow a path.


221
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:05,579 line:-2
Although a stroke
can have any thickness,


222
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,715 line:-2
it typically uses
the path as its center.


223
00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:10.784 line:-2 align:center
That means that
the actual vector points


224
00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:13.153 line:-2 align:center
that will define
the thickness of the stroke


225
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,656 line:-2
are not reliable
for interpolation,


226
00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:17.958 line:-2 align:center
as the strokes
have no vector points


227
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,027 line:-1
on their borders.


228
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.329 line:-2 align:center
To ensure
that the drawings are reliable,


229
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,298 line:-1
to facilitate interpolation


230
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:26.266 line:-1 align:center
and better control the shapes,


231
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.203 line:-2 align:center
the strokes
must be converted to outlines,


232
00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:30.304 line:-1 align:center
which can be achieved


233
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,606 line:-1
with most vector graphic editors


234
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,641 line:-1
and design tools.


235
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,512 line:-2
Now that we know
how SF Symbols are drawn,


236
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:41,515 line:-2
let's look at their structure
and shapes.


237
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,850 line:-1
As you may have noticed,


238
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:45,686 line:-2
some symbols combine
two or more objects,


239
00:09:45.719 --> 00:09:47.120 line:-1 align:center
like the share symbol,


240
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,455 line:-1
which is a combination


241
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:51,058 line:-1
of an arrow and a square.


242
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,227 line:-1
When those objects are combined,


243
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.432 line:-2 align:center
we can emphasize one shape
while de-emphasizing the other.


244
00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:01.134 line:-2 align:center
That way,
we can define design strategies


245
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:04,238 line:-1
with badges and overlaps.


246
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:07.107 line:-2 align:center
We can determine the foreground
and background elements


247
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,643 line:-1
in just one symbol


248
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,678 line:-2
and even
create different variants


249
00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:15.015 line:-2 align:center
with its different
container shapes.


250
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:17,017 line:-1
There is a lot of versatility.


251
00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.053 line:-1 align:center
We can even highlight screens.


252
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:23,557 line:-2
And this is all done
with what we call annotations.


253
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,759 line:-2
We group
the enclosed vectors of a path


254
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,794 line:-1
like layers inside a symbol.


255
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,430 line:-2
That way,
we can quickly identify


256
00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:32.432 line:-1 align:center
a primary, secondary,


257
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,001 line:-1
and even tertiary layer


258
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,469 line:-1
of a symbol structure,


259
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,037 line:-1
creating a hierarchy.


260
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,339 line:-2
So imagine
all the possibilities.


261
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,308 line:-2
Symbols are getting ready
to be displayed


262
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.543 line:-1 align:center
in all their glory,


263
00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:45.445 line:-2 align:center
but not before we talk
about rendering modes.


264
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,813 line:-1
Colors can speak in ways


265
00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:49.016 line:-2 align:center
that are as powerful
as language,


266
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,019 line:-2
plus it is more than just
an aesthetic element,


267
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,787 line:-1
as it can affect thinking,


268
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,823 line:-2
help change actions,
and create reactions.


269
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,725 line:-1
As a form of communication,


270
00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:01.528 line:-1 align:center
color is compelling.


271
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:02,863 line:-1
And as you can see,


272
00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:05.299 line:-2 align:center
SF Symbols
become highly versatile


273
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,100 line:-1
when color is applied to them


274
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:10,170 line:-2
making them
an even more powerful tool.


275
00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:11.872 line:-1 align:center
When color is present,


276
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,241 line:-2
the symbols become
one of the most essential


277
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,510 line:-1
methods of engaging the user,


278
00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:19.379 line:-2 align:center
helping you create a statement
or draw attention.


279
00:11:19.413 --> 00:11:21.381 line:-2 align:center
This year,
we are happy to announce


280
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:24,384 line:-2
that we have new rendering modes
to choose from:


281
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,920 line:-1
Hierarchical and Palette,


282
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:30,557 line:-2
in addition to Multicolor
and Monochrome.


283
00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:32.793 line:-2 align:center
First let's look
at Hierarchical.


284
00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:34.328 line:-1 align:center
Hierarchical rendering mode


285
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,497 line:-2
uses a single color
with varying opacities


286
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,067 line:-2
that add
visual hierarchy to a symbol,


287
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,336 line:-1
creating depth and emphasis


288
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:46,940 line:-2
while allowing a single hue
to drive the overall aesthetic.


289
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:49,443 line:-2
When multiple symbols
that share common shapes


290
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:52,012 line:-2
are presented
alongside one another,


291
00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.313 line:-1 align:center
this rendering mode


292
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:55,749 line:-2
emphasizes the differences
between them,


293
00:11:55.782 --> 00:11:59.853 line:-2 align:center
intending to make the symbols
more legible and recognizable.


294
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:03,023 line:-2
It also attempts to reduce
redundant visual noise


295
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,125 line:-1
by modulating the opacity


296
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,227 line:-2
without removing
the essential elements


297
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:09,396 line:-1
of the symbol.


298
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,932 line:-2
We achieve this
by annotating the symbols


299
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,800 line:-1
with the desired hierarchy,


300
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,670 line:-2
considering
the primary, secondary,


301
00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:17.838 line:-1 align:center
and in some cases,


302
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,707 line:-2
the tertiary element
of a symbol.


303
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,243 line:-2
When a base color
is applied to a symbol,


304
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:24,878 line:-1
it is automatically applied


305
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,181 line:-2
to all the layers
in the hierarchy,


306
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,882 line:-1
using different opacities


307
00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:30.918 line:-2 align:center
to emphasize
the key characteristics


308
00:12:30.951 --> 00:12:32.986 line:-1 align:center
of the symbol.


309
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,722 line:-2
Let's analyze
these symbols again,


310
00:12:35.756 --> 00:12:38.458 line:-2 align:center
now with
the Hierarchical rendering mode.


311
00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:41.595 line:-2 align:center
Some symbols
have all the hierarchy levels.


312
00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:43.797 line:-2 align:center
This symbol
with a cloud, sun, and rain


313
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.399 line:-1 align:center
is a good example,


314
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,234 line:-1
but one important thing to know


315
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,368 line:-1
is that most symbols


316
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,804 line:-2
don't have
all these three levels.


317
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,607 line:-2
This is due to the nature
of their designs.


318
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,143 line:-1
Let's focus on these symbols.


319
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,578 line:-1
Shapes that don't touch


320
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,313 line:-1
or have a gap between the first


321
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,348 line:-1
and second element of a symbol


322
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:03.450 line:-1 align:center
are considered secondary,


323
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,085 line:-1
while shapes that do touch


324
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.654 line:-2 align:center
and are encapsulated
inside one another,


325
00:13:07.688 --> 00:13:09.790 line:-2 align:center
like the filled circle
or the screens


326
00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:11.325 line:-1 align:center
shown in these examples,


327
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,794 line:-1
become tertiary.


328
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,729 line:-2
With Hierarchical
rendering mode,


329
00:13:15.762 --> 00:13:18.198 line:-2 align:center
we can achieve
more robust interfaces


330
00:13:18.232 --> 00:13:23.070 line:-2 align:center
with just the emphasis
on hierarchy and color.


331
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,539 line:-2
We saw what we could do
with Hierarchical.


332
00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:29.743 line:-2 align:center
Now with Palette,
we have even more possibilities.


333
00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:32.346 line:-2 align:center
As we learned,
the Hierarchical rendering mode


334
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,381 line:-1
uses a single color.


335
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,950 line:-2
In contrast,
Palette rendering mode


336
00:13:36.984 --> 00:13:41.021 line:-2 align:center
gives the possibility to use
two or more contrasting colors,


337
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,891 line:-2
each of which
can be controlled independently,


338
00:13:43.924 --> 00:13:45.559 line:-1 align:center
giving elements of a symbol


339
00:13:45.592 --> 00:13:48.762 line:-2 align:center
more prominence,
emphasis, and versatility


340
00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:51.431 line:-1 align:center
when color is applied to them.


341
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,934 line:-2
Additionally,
Palette rendering mode


342
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,502 line:-1
has opacity controls


343
00:13:55.536 --> 00:13:58.172 line:-2 align:center
that give us
even more possibilities,


344
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,340 line:-2
allowing for symbols
to be customized


345
00:14:00.374 --> 00:14:03.744 line:-2 align:center
to better integrate
with the UI's overall look.


346
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,179 line:-1
This rendering mode


347
00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:07.781 line:-2 align:center
relies on the same layer
annotation data


348
00:14:07.814 --> 00:14:09.383 line:-1 align:center
as Hierarchical.


349
00:14:09.416 --> 00:14:11.885 line:-2 align:center
If only two colors
are applied to it,


350
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,921 line:-2
the tertiary layer group
replicates


351
00:14:13.954 --> 00:14:16.156 line:-1 align:center
the secondary layer annotation,


352
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,124 line:-1
so remember this


353
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,593 line:-2
when annotating
your own symbols.


354
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,162 line:-1
In Palette rendering mode,


355
00:14:22.196 --> 00:14:23.564 line:-1 align:center
a set of symbols can have


356
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:26,600 line:-2
the same defined color palette
applied to them,


357
00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.736 line:-2 align:center
helping the user
identify a group of symbols


358
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,206 line:-2
with the same level
of functionalities.


359
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,274 line:-1
In contrast,


360
00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:35.776 line:-1 align:center
a similar set of symbols


361
00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:37.845 line:-1 align:center
can each use unique colors


362
00:14:37.878 --> 00:14:40.314 line:-2 align:center
to define
a particular functionality,


363
00:14:40.347 --> 00:14:42.449 line:-2 align:center
reinforcing the actions
of the symbol


364
00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:44.218 line:-1 align:center
and making them more distinct


365
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,919 line:-1
between one another.


366
00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:48.722 line:-1 align:center
With Palette rendering mode,


367
00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:52.326 line:-2 align:center
you can bring contrast
and versatility to your symbols.


368
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:55,963 line:-1
Now let's talk about Multicolor.


369
00:14:56.964 --> 00:14:59.633 line:-2 align:center
Multicolor is a rendering mode
that represents


370
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,569 line:-2
the intrinsic
or native color of a symbol.


371
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:05,706 line:-2
That means it uses
a multitude of different colors


372
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,941 line:-2
that relate
to the appearance of an object


373
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,276 line:-1
in the physical world,


374
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,712 line:-2
or it conveys meaning
between a concept


375
00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:13.247 line:-1 align:center
and an assigned color,


376
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.848 line:-1 align:center
like in this example.


377
00:15:14.882 --> 00:15:17.618 line:-2 align:center
The concept Add
is linked to the color Green,


378
00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:21.154 line:-2 align:center
and the concept Remove
is linked to the color Red.


379
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:24,324 line:-2
Many symbols feature
this intrinsic color palette


380
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,894 line:-2
which is
what's rendered by default.


381
00:15:26.927 --> 00:15:28.295 line:-1 align:center
When customized,


382
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,598 line:-2
each color can be assigned
an arbitrary one.


383
00:15:31.632 --> 00:15:33.000 line:-1 align:center
With Multicolor symbols,


384
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,502 line:-2
you can emphasize
the symbol's identity,


385
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,437 line:-2
creating a stronger
color narrative


386
00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:40.073 line:-2 align:center
that associates
with the symbols' forms.


387
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,209 line:-2
There are a few ways
in which Multicolor


388
00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:44.011 line:-1 align:center
can affect a symbol.


389
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,180 line:-1
A symbol can be fully colored.


390
00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:48.081 line:-2 align:center
A symbol
can be partially colored,


391
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,850 line:-2
which means
that part of a symbol


392
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,618 line:-2
will have
the Multicolor feature,


393
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:54,488 line:-2
while the other will rely
on an accent color.


394
00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:55.722 line:-1 align:center
And finally,


395
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:59,626 line:-2
if a symbol does not contain
any Multicolor information,


396
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,762 line:-1
it will render in Monochrome.


397
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:05,699 line:-2
This year, we are introducing
several new symbols


398
00:16:05.732 --> 00:16:07.734 line:-1 align:center
with Multicolor functionality.


399
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:10,037 line:-2
The range of colors
from which this draws


400
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.505 line:-1 align:center
is limitless.


401
00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:14.675 line:-1 align:center
And lastly, we have Monochrome.


402
00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:17.077 line:-1 align:center
Monochrome is the rendering mode


403
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.645 line:-1 align:center
that most closely reflects


404
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,281 line:-2
the typographic nature
of SF Symbols.


405
00:16:22.282 --> 00:16:24.251 line:-1 align:center
Color-wise, it is neutral


406
00:16:24.284 --> 00:16:25.786 line:-1 align:center
as it accommodates for symbols


407
00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:27.487 line:-1 align:center
to commingle with one another


408
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:30,991 line:-2
without emphasizing
one over the other.


409
00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:36.396 line:-2 align:center
Monochrome also benefits
from color and opacity controls,


410
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,832 line:-2
but the difference
with other rendering modes


411
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:40,334 line:-1
is that in Monochrome,


412
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,736 line:-2
the opacity is applied
to all the symbol


413
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,106 line:-2
without making use
of the layer annotation data.


414
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,010 line:-2
When uniformity
is of first importance,


415
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,478 line:-1
Monochrome is ideal,


416
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:54,848 line:-2
as it is the most unified
and consistent rendering mode.


417
00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.886 line:-2 align:center
Next let's talk about
the SF Symbols app.


418
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,389 line:-2
This year,
we have made significant changes


419
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,024 line:-1
to the SF Symbols app.


420
00:17:04.057 --> 00:17:05.225 line:-1 align:center
As we have seen,


421
00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:08.529 line:-2 align:center
we have all the new and improved
rendering modes:


422
00:17:08.562 --> 00:17:10.297 line:-1 align:center
Monochrome,


423
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,533 line:-1
Hierarchical,


424
00:17:12.566 --> 00:17:14.067 line:-1 align:center
Palette,


425
00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:15.235 line:-1 align:center
and Multicolor.


426
00:17:16.236 --> 00:17:19.273 line:-2 align:center
To access all these colors
for the rendering modes,


427
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,241 line:-1
we have the color picker.


428
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:24,278 line:-2
Here you can choose
from the existing color library,


429
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,713 line:-1
select the system accent color,


430
00:17:26.747 --> 00:17:29.283 line:-2 align:center
or even define your own
custom colors,


431
00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:31.251 line:-1 align:center
and indeed, all colors shown


432
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:32,619 line:-1
in the SF Symbols app


433
00:17:32.653 --> 00:17:35.189 line:-2 align:center
are all available
on all platforms.


434
00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:37.858 line:-2 align:center
We also have some updates
to the color library


435
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,226 line:-1
in light,


436
00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:40.294 line:-1 align:center
dark,


437
00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:42.763 line:-2 align:center
and increased contrast
appearances


438
00:17:42.796 --> 00:17:44.498 line:-1 align:center
with some colors adapting


439
00:17:44.531 --> 00:17:46.533 line:-1 align:center
depending on the platform.


440
00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:47.601 line:-1 align:center
As a result,


441
00:17:47.634 --> 00:17:49.736 line:-2 align:center
some platforms
will get new colors


442
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.772 line:-2 align:center
that were
previously only available


443
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,440 line:-1
on other platforms.


444
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,309 line:-1
For example, Brown--


445
00:17:55.342 --> 00:17:57.978 line:-2 align:center
previously
only available on macOS--


446
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:00,814 line:-2
is now available
on all platforms.


447
00:18:01.815 --> 00:18:04.918 line:-2 align:center
We also re-defined Teal
with a greener hue


448
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:06,887 line:-2
to reflect
its visual representation


449
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.589 line:-1 align:center
more accurately.


450
00:18:08.622 --> 00:18:10.290 line:-1 align:center
Cyan is a new color name


451
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:13,160 line:-2
that will use
the previous Teal color values.


452
00:18:13.193 --> 00:18:15.062 line:-2 align:center
If you were
previously using Teal,


453
00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:17.397 line:-2 align:center
you will need to switch
to the color Cyan


454
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,633 line:-2
to maintain
the legacy appearance.


455
00:18:20.634 --> 00:18:23.070 line:-1 align:center
Additionally, Indigo and Purple


456
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,205 line:-1
are available on all platforms


457
00:18:25.239 --> 00:18:27.941 line:-2 align:center
with more consistent
hue definitions.


458
00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:32.246 line:-2 align:center
From rendering mode selection
to color customization,


459
00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:34.815 line:-2 align:center
SF Symbols
is an extremely powerful tool


460
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:38,218 line:-2
to use when implementing symbols
in your UIs.


461
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,954 line:-2
If you want to learn more
about the SF Symbols App,


462
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:45,425 line:-2
check out this year's session
"Explore the SF Symbols 3 App."


463
00:18:46.426 --> 00:18:48.595 line:-2 align:center
So, let's recap
what we'e covered.


464
00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:50.264 line:-1 align:center
We have a new version of the app


465
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,699 line:-2
that is now
available for download.


466
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,068 line:-1
We have hundreds of new symbols.


467
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:56,837 line:-2
You can find
the new beta version


468
00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:02.442 line:-2 align:center
of the SF Symbols app in
developer.apple.com/sf-symbols.


469
00:19:03.443 --> 00:19:05.045 line:-1 align:center
We talked about variants,


470
00:19:05.078 --> 00:19:08.315 line:-2 align:center
and we had a quick recap
of the SF Symbols basics.


471
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:12,219 line:-2
We have new script coverage
for localized symbols


472
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:15,822 line:-2
and new symbols adapting to
right-to-left writing systems.


473
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,259 line:-2
We learned about
the anatomy of a symbol


474
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:21,895 line:-2
and how drawing
with vector points and paths


475
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:24,298 line:-2
can make
layer annotation possible.


476
00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:26.700 line:-1 align:center
We talked about color


477
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,969 line:-2
with some awesome
new rendering modes:


478
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,371 line:-1
Hierarchical and Palette.


479
00:19:31.405 --> 00:19:33.273 line:-1 align:center
And we reviewed more in-depth


480
00:19:33.307 --> 00:19:35.776 line:-2 align:center
the Multicolor
and Monochrome modes


481
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,978 line:-1
with all their amazing features.


482
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,214 line:-2
Remember that
all rendering modes


483
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:41,448 line:-1
adapt dynamically


484
00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:43.617 line:-2 align:center
with Apple platform
system colors.


485
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:47,321 line:-2
These automatically
adjust the vibrancy,


486
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,755 line:-1
accessibility settings,


487
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:49.857 line:-1 align:center
and appearance modes.


488
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.527 line:-2 align:center
These rendering modes
work with custom colors as well.


489
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,964 line:-2
And we saw
the new SF Symbols app


490
00:19:56.997 --> 00:20:00.100 line:-2 align:center
and learned about
all the color library updates.


491
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,002 line:-1
This year,


492
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,104 line:-2
SF Symbols
becomes more powerful,


493
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,206 line:-1
flexible, and configurable,


494
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.742 line:-1 align:center
tailored to suit your needs.


495
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:12,012 line:-1
One symbol in nine weights


496
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,680 line:-1
with three scales each


497
00:20:13.714 --> 00:20:15.516 line:-1 align:center
in four rendering modes.


498
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,651 line:-1
That is amazing.


499
00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:19.786 line:-2 align:center
I hope you enjoyed
learning about


500
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.555 line:-1 align:center
what's new in SF Symbols.


501
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,757 line:-2
We can't wait to see
what you will do.
