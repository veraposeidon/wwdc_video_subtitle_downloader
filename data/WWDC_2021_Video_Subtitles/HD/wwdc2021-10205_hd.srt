00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.611 line:-1 align:center
[Kieran] Hi, everyone.


4
00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:13.013 line:-2 align:center
My name is Kieran,
and I'm an Xcode engineer


5
00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.482 line:-2 align:center
working on source control
technologies.


6
00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:19.152 line:-2 align:center
Xcode 13 completely
reimagines code review mode


7
00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.289 line:-2 align:center
and introduces brand new
collaboration workflows


8
00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.125 line:-2 align:center
to help you improve
the quality of your app.


9
00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.628 line:-2 align:center
In this session,
I'll walk you through


10
00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:30.330 line:-2 align:center
a typical workflow
with our app Fruta.


11
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.099 line:-1 align:center
We'll use the new code review


12
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,668 line:-2
and pull request features
in Xcode 13


13
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,538 line:-1
to find a bug, get feedback,


14
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,940 line:-1
integrate those changes,


15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,643 line:-2
and provide feedback
to my colleagues.


16
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,578 line:-1
Let's get started.


17
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:47,447 line:-2
A big part of my work
is looking into issues


18
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,917 line:-1
that our users reported.


19
00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:52.619 line:-2 align:center
In order to fix a bug,
I first have to understand


20
00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.955 line:-2 align:center
when and why
it started happening.


21
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:58,058 line:-2
By stepping back in time
through my code changes,


22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,495 line:-2
I can often figure out the cause
using code review mode.


23
00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.931 line:-2 align:center
One of the App Store reviews
we had


24
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.800 line:-2 align:center
mentioned that some UI changes
recently made to our app


25
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.936 line:-1 align:center
don't look quite right.


26
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,538 line:-2
I have a pretty good idea
what the issues are,


27
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,474 line:-2
so I'll go ahead and start
making some changes.


28
00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.677 line:-1 align:center
As I start typing,


29
00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:19.613 line:-2 align:center
the changes appear
in the source editor's gutter.


30
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:22,950 line:-2
I find it really useful to know
what the previous values were


31
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,220 line:-2
so I can have a good idea
of everything that's changed.


32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,356 line:-2
For this, I can jump into
code review mode.


33
00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:33.293 line:-2 align:center
Simply click on the Code Review
button in the editor bar


34
00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.696 line:-2 align:center
to see the comparison
of local edits


35
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,031 line:-2
against the most recent
revision.


36
00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:42.703 line:-2 align:center
As I'm working on my document,
code review mode


37
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,405 line:-2
continuously highlights
the edits I'm making


38
00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:48.408 line:-2 align:center
so I always know what's changed
since my last commit.


39
00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:55.249 line:-2 align:center
When I've made multiple edits
to a file,


40
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,417 line:-2
the stepper control
in the bottom bar


41
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,953 line:-2
shows me how many changes
I've made.


42
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:04,091 line:-2
Clicking the arrow icons will
jump between my code changes.


43
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:06.326 line:-2 align:center
That way, I don't have to
scroll through the file


44
00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.395 line:-1 align:center
looking for the edits myself.


45
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,564 line:-1
Sometimes it can be easier


46
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,733 line:-2
to see what's changed
side-by-side,


47
00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.968 line:-2 align:center
but I prefer
to see my changes in-line.


48
00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:18.472 line:-2 align:center
Xcode can show me my changes
in either style,


49
00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.240 line:-1 align:center
and I can flip between the two


50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,543 line:-2
using the Editor menu
at the top right.


51
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:25,145 line:-2
I want to ensure that
I've caught every issue


52
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,847 line:-1
with the UI bug.


53
00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:30.150 line:-2 align:center
To really dig in and understand
where a bug came from,


54
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.620 line:-2 align:center
I need to see what's changed
between releases of my app.


55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,157 line:-2
I can use the commit controls
in the bottom bar


56
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.026 line:-1 align:center
to set up those comparisons.


57
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,763 line:-2
Xcode 13 allows me to choose
commits across my branches,


58
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,199 line:-2
tags,
and most recent locations


59
00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.601 line:-2 align:center
so I can easily see
the changes in my app


60
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:50.070 line:-2 align:center
between
any two points in time.


61
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.372 line:-1 align:center
I usually cut a release branch


62
00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.375 line:-2 align:center
every time I submit
to TestFlights or the App Store,


63
00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.945 line:-2 align:center
so I'll take a look at
two versions of my code


64
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,513 line:-1
related to that release.


65
00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:04.251 line:-2 align:center
With my commit selected,
Xcode shows me a comparison


66
00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:07.788 line:-2 align:center
of the two historical versions
of my document.


67
00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:10.624 line:-2 align:center
The highlight colors change
to purple and orange,


68
00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:14.528 line:-2 align:center
corresponding with the commits
displayed in the bottom bar.


69
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,763 line:-2
As before,
I can jump between changes


70
00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:18.866 line:-1 align:center
using the stepper control.


71
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:25,138 line:-2
I can see the comparison either
in-line or side-by-side.


72
00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:27.708 line:-2 align:center
When I'm done
exploring this comparison,


73
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,544 line:-2
I can quickly snap back
to my most recent changes


74
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,647 line:-2
using the Reset button
in the bottom bar.


75
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,216 line:-2
Usually, the changes
that I make to my apps


76
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.252 line:-1 align:center
span across multiple files.


77
00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:41.855 line:-2 align:center
While it's really useful to
explore changes within one file,


78
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,757 line:-1
I often want an overview


79
00:03:43.757 --> 00:03:47.361 line:-2 align:center
for all of the files that I've
changed across my whole project.


80
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:51.365 line:-2 align:center
Thanks to the new Changes tab
in the Source Control Navigator,


81
00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:53.934 line:-2 align:center
I can see a list of
all the files I've changed


82
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,669 line:-1
since my last commit.


83
00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.337 line:-1 align:center
Clicking on any of them


84
00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:59.873 line:-2 align:center
will automatically
enter code review mode


85
00:03:59.873 --> 00:04:02.943 line:-2 align:center
and show me all the changes
that I've made in that file.


86
00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:05.078 line:-1 align:center
I like to flip between the files


87
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,415 line:-2
to quickly remind myself
of the other edits I've made.


88
00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:11.385 line:-2 align:center
Now that I know why
our app has this issue


89
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,786 line:-1
when displaying ingredients,


90
00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:14.755 line:-2 align:center
I'll go ahead and create
a new branch


91
00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:16.857 line:-1 align:center
with my changes to fix it.


92
00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:20.294 line:-2 align:center
Creating and switching branches
is something I do a lot,


93
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:23,564 line:-2
and Xcode 13 has a great
new way to do that.


94
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:27,100 line:-2
Xcode's toolbar now
shows my current branch,


95
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.971 line:-2 align:center
which is a helpful reminder
of what I was last working on.


96
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.073 line:-2 align:center
By clicking on it,
I can quickly switch


97
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,643 line:-2
between any of the branches
that I worked on recently.


98
00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:39.613 line:-2 align:center
In this case,
I'll use the secondary menu


99
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,316 line:-1
to create a branch for my fix.


100
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,461 line:-2
After exploring history
in code review mode,


101
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,864 line:-2
I was able to come up
with a fix for the bug.


102
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,600 line:-2
Now that I have
a proposed solution,


103
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,835 line:-2
I want to get feedback
on my code change.


104
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,272 line:-2
Since I'm not totally familiar
with this part of the code base,


105
00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:07.107 line:-1 align:center
I'd like my teammates to confirm


106
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,010 line:-2
that my changes
won't introduce other issues.


107
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.613 line:-2 align:center
To collaborate
with my peers on a code change,


108
00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:14.815 line:-1 align:center
I'll create a pull request.


109
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,217 line:-2
I can do that right
from Xcode 13


110
00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:19.987 line:-2 align:center
using its new integrated
support for GitHub


111
00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:22.689 line:-1 align:center
and Bitbucket Server.


112
00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.057 line:-1 align:center
I can create my pull requests


113
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,193 line:-2
right from
the source control popover.


114
00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:28.962 line:-2 align:center
Xcode will create
a draft pull request


115
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,297 line:-1
to merge with my branch


116
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,399 line:-2
into the default upstream
branch,


117
00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.234 line:-1 align:center
which in this case is main.


118
00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:37.237 line:-2 align:center
I can prepare my pull request
with information about the fix


119
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,373 line:-1
before publishing it.


120
00:05:39.373 --> 00:05:42.276 line:-2 align:center
The changes that I've committed
and pushed to my branch


121
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,478 line:-2
will show up
in the Pull Request section


122
00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:46.180 line:-1 align:center
in the Changes Navigator,


123
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.615 line:-2 align:center
giving me a preview of the
changes that will be included


124
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,517 line:-1
once published.


125
00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:53.720 line:-2 align:center
The Local Changes section
lets me see files


126
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,956 line:-2
that won't be included
in my pull request


127
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,625 line:-1
until I commit and push them.


128
00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:01.595 line:-2 align:center
When I'm happy with the contents
of my pull request,


129
00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:04.198 line:-2 align:center
I'll give it a title
and a description.


130
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,210 line:-2
I'd like to ask a few
teammates in particular


131
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.544 line:-1 align:center
to review this change,


132
00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.913 line:-2 align:center
so I'll click
the Participants button


133
00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:21.715 line:-1 align:center
and tag them as Reviewers.


134
00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:34.628 line:-2 align:center
As I wait for feedback
and switch to other branches,


135
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,731 line:-2
Xcode figures out
which pull request to display.


136
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,568 line:-2
Xcode will determine
the associated pull request


137
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,905 line:-2
based on its source branch
and your current branch.


138
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,306 line:-1
When you switch branches,


139
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:50,911 line:-2
Xcode will automatically
discover existing pull requests.


140
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.514 line:-2 align:center
I published my pull request
a little while ago,


141
00:06:53.514 --> 00:06:56.049 line:-2 align:center
and my team has since
left me some feedback.


142
00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:58.552 line:-1 align:center
Let's take a look at that now.


143
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,655 line:-2
With the pull request selected
in the Changes Navigator,


144
00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:04.224 line:-2 align:center
I can see an overview
of my pull request


145
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:07,294 line:-2
and everything that's happened
since I published it.


146
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:11,164 line:0
My team has left me
some feedback on my code.


147
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,200 align:center
I can reply to these
discussions if I like


148
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,036 line:0
or click "View Changes"
to jump straight into the file


149
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,971 align:center
in code review mode.


150
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,409 line:-2
There are some great suggestions
in here from Matt,


151
00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:24.111 line:-1 align:center
and now we have the opportunity


152
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:27.514 line:-2 align:center
to have this conversation
about my pull request in Xcode


153
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,450 line:-2
and connect it
directly to source code.


154
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,220 line:-2
I went ahead and updated
my pull request


155
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,222 line:-1
in response to the feedback.


156
00:07:35.222 --> 00:07:38.225 line:-2 align:center
Now, looking at the comments
that my teammates have left here


157
00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:41.328 line:-2 align:center
it looks like they're on board
with my latest change.


158
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,231 line:-2
I see that my colleague has
approved this pull request.


159
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,166 line:-2
Now I just need to
check my status


160
00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:48.836 line:-2 align:center
of our continuous
integration workflow.


161
00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:52.506 line:-2 align:center
Since I'm using Xcode Cloud,
I can also see the status


162
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,775 line:-2
of my continuous integration
workflows


163
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,444 line:-2
within the pull
request's CI popover.


164
00:07:57.444 --> 00:08:00.781 line:-2 align:center
I'm able to quickly see
a summary of my test results,


165
00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:02.416 line:-1 align:center
and clicking on an entry


166
00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:05.853 line:-2 align:center
will jump me straight into
a detailed Xcode Cloud report.


167
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,455 line:-2
For more information
about Xcode Cloud


168
00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:10.257 line:-1 align:center
and running your code in CI,


169
00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:13.093 line:-2 align:center
check out the session
"Meet Xcode Cloud."


170
00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:16.630 line:-2 align:center
OK, since my teammates
have all approved my changes


171
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.433 line:-2 align:center
and all of my Xcode Cloud jobs
have succeeded,


172
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,869 line:-2
I'm ready
to merge my pull request.


173
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:25,205 line:-2
I'll use the Pull Request
actions and select "Merge."


174
00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:27.841 line:-2 align:center
Xcode allows me
to select a merge strategy


175
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.277 line:-2 align:center
which determines
how changes are integrated


176
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,346 line:-1
into the target branch.


177
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,883 line:-2
I'll choose the default, which
will include a Merge Commit.


178
00:08:35.883 --> 00:08:38.318 line:-2 align:center
You can also enter an optional
commit message,


179
00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:40.721 line:-1 align:center
but I'll leave it as it is.


180
00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:43.357 line:-2 align:center
Everything looks good,
so I'll merge it now.


181
00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:48.262 line:-2 align:center
Now that I've merged
my pull request,


182
00:08:48.262 --> 00:08:50.597 line:-2 align:center
it's time to switch back
to other work.


183
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,065 line:-1
Just like I find it helpful


184
00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:54.134 line:-2 align:center
to ask my peers
for their feedback,


185
00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:57.304 line:-2 align:center
they often ask me
to review their changes, too.


186
00:08:58.572 --> 00:09:01.008 line:-2 align:center
In addition to branches
I've worked on recently,


187
00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:04.478 line:-2 align:center
the source control popover
also shows me the pull requests


188
00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:05.879 line:-1 align:center
that are relevant to me.


189
00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.549 line:-2 align:center
I'll see the pull requests
that I've created,


190
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,118 line:-2
but Xcode also shows me
any pull requests


191
00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:14.121 line:-2 align:center
that my teammates
have requested I review.


192
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,857 line:-2
Looking in the source control
popover,


193
00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:18.525 line:-2 align:center
it looks like
one of my teammates


194
00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:20.894 line:-1 align:center
has asked me to do just that.


195
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.997 line:-2 align:center
Let's check out
their branch and review it.


196
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,899 line:-2
Just like with
my own pull requests,


197
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.135 line:-2 align:center
I can see his overview,
review status,


198
00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:30.604 line:-2 align:center
and discussions
on my teammates' pull requests


199
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,306 line:-1
since I've been tagged in.


200
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,508 line:-2
Let's take a look
at their changes.


201
00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:37.578 line:-2 align:center
I'll step through the files
in the Changes Navigator


202
00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:39.313 line:-1 align:center
under the pull request node.


203
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:44.184 line:-2 align:center
Clicking on any of these will
snap me into code review mode,


204
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,186 line:-2
showing me the changes
that will be applied


205
00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:49.256 line:-1 align:center
if the pull request is merged.


206
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,425 line:-2
I can leave a comment
for him inside the editor


207
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,093 line:-1
by secondary clicking


208
00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.629 line:-2 align:center
and inserting a new comment
on the line.


209
00:09:55.629 --> 00:09:58.832 line:-2 align:center
I think I see a potential
improvement in his code,


210
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,168 line:-2
so let's leave a note
for my teammate.


211
00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:07.508 line:-1 align:center
My feedback was pretty minor,


212
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:09,610 line:-2
and this pull request
looks good to go.


213
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,679 line:-2
I'll approve it using
the actions in the top right.


214
00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:22.656 line:-2 align:center
Xcode 13 offers great new ways
to review code


215
00:10:22.656 --> 00:10:25.125 line:-1 align:center
and collaborate with your peers.


216
00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:28.829 line:-2 align:center
Code review mode is a powerful
tool for investigating issues


217
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,064 line:-2
and behavioral changes
in your app


218
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,466 line:-1
by giving you insight


219
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,903 line:-2
into how your app's source
code has changed over time.


220
00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:38.772 line:-2 align:center
Code review mode also
provides you with a new


221
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:42,676 line:-2
in-line presentation mode
and expanded comparison options


222
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:46,413 line:-2
to allow for more flexibility
for your workflow.


223
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:49,383 line:-2
Pull requests allow you
to collaborate with your team


224
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:51,518 line:-2
to improve your
app's code quality


225
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:55,422 line:-2
by giving and receiving code
feedback on your team's changes


226
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:58,258 line:-2
before merging them
into the main branch.


227
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,428 line:-2
Discussions show up
right in your app's source code,


228
00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:05.666 line:-2 align:center
making teamwork truly part
of the development process.


229
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:10,304 line:-2
Thank you, have a great WWDC,
and [foreign language].
