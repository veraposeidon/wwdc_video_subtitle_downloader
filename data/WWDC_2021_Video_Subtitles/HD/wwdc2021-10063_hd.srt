[Russell] Hello!


5
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:14.915 line:-2
My name is Russell, and I'm
an engineer on the UIKit team.


6
00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:18.685 line:-2
In iOS 13, we introduced
a refined appearance for sheets,


7
00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.020 line:-1
bringing them to Phone


8
00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:23.023 line:-2
and adding a universal
pull-to-dismiss gesture.


9
00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.626 line:-2
To learn more about this,
watch the video


10
00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:29.997 line:-2
Modernizing Your UI for iOS 13,
specifically the section about


11
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.901 line:-2
Presentations starting 9 minutes
and 45 seconds in.


12
00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:37.037 line:-2
In iOS 15,
we've built on that foundation


13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.140 line:-2
by adding a bunch of
customization options to sheets,


14
00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:43.610 line:-2
so you can now use them in
fun new ways like never before.


15
00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:45.779 line:-2
We've added support
for a medium detent,


16
00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.282 line:-2
which allows you to create
a vertically resizable sheet


17
00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:50.317 line:-2
that only covers
half the screen.


18
00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.154 line:-2
You can also now remove
the dimming view,


19
00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:56.623 line:-2
which will allow you to build
a nonmodal UI


20
00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:59.693 line:-2
where the user can interact
with content behind the sheet


21
00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.429 line:-1
while the sheet is presented.


22
00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.631 line:-2
Next, I'll cover some
new visual options,


23
00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.401 line:-2
including how to get
a non-full-screen appearance


24
00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.970 line:-1
on phones in landscape.


25
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.472 line:-2
And finally,
I'll show how to set up a UI


26
00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:14.608 line:-2
that seamlessly adapts
between a popover


27
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.210 line:-1
in regular size classes


28
00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.912 line:-2
and a customized sheet
in compact size classes.


29
00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.349 line:-2
To explore all of this,
we've made a sample app


30
00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.318 line:-1
for creating digital postcards,


31
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.420 line:-2
and it's available
with this video.


32
00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:29.456 line:-2
For each postcard,
I can customize the picture


33
00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.326 line:-2
as well as the text
and the font.


34
00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.928 line:-2
Now, before I can
customize a sheet,


35
00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:36.530 line:-1
first I have to get one.


36
00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:38.265 line:-1
A sheet is an instance of a new


37
00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.567 line:-2
UIPresentationController
subclass


38
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:43.203 line:-2
called
UISheetPresentationController,


39
00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:45.706 line:-2
and all of the customization
options are exposed


40
00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.442 line:-1
as properties on this class.


41
00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.777 line:-2
The typical way to get
an instance of this class


42
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:51.812 line:-1
is to read


43
00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.947 line:-2
the sheetPresentationController
property


44
00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:56.316 line:-2
on a view controller
before you present it.


45
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.418 line:-2
This method returns
a non-nil instance


46
00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:01.255 line:-2
as long the view controller's
modalPresentationStyle


47
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:04.291 line:-2
is form sheet or page sheet,
which it is by default.


48
00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:07.628 line:-1
From here, you can then set


49
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.564 line:-2
various properties
on the instance to customize it.


50
00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.900 line:-2
This is the same pattern
as getting a view controller's


51
00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:16.670 line:-2
popoverPresentationController
and setting its properties.


52
00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.706 line:-2
And with that,
let's jump into detents.


53
00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:23.610 line:-1
What are detents?


54
00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:27.981 line:-2
A detent is a height
where a sheet naturally rests,


55
00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:29.816 line:-2
and these are defined
as a fraction


56
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.452 line:-2
of the fully expanded
sheet frame.


57
00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.488 line:-2
The fully expanded frame
is visualized


58
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.190 line:-1
on an iPhone and iPad here,


59
00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:39.259 line:-2
and it should be familiar
if you've used sheets before.


60
00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:43.330 line:-2
We've exposed two system-defined
detents in iOS 15:


61
00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.265 line:-2
a medium detent,
which is about half


62
00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.701 line:-2
of a sheet's full height,
and a large detent,


63
00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.070 line:-2
which is the height
of a fully expanded sheet.


64
00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:54.541 line:-2
To specify which detents
you want a sheet to support,


65
00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:56.977 line:-2
simply set an array
of the detents you want


66
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.712 line:-1
on the detents property.


67
00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.714 line:-2
The default value
of this property is an array


68
00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:03.283 line:-2
of just the large detent,
which is why if you don't


69
00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:06.320 line:-2
set it at all, you get
a standard full height sheet.


70
00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:12.726 line:-2
If you set this to an array
of the medium and large detents,


71
00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.328 line:-2
you get a sheet
that is resizable


72
00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.397 line:-1
between medium and large.


73
00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:19.566 line:-2
But you can also set this
to an array


74
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.401 line:-1
of just the medium detent,


75
00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.737 line:-2
which gives you a sheet
that presents at medium height


76
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.107 line:-2
and cannot be resized
to full height.


77
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.843 line:-2
Let's apply this
to the sample app.


78
00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:33.380 line:-2
I'm starting with some code
that targets the iOS 14 SDK


79
00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:36.683 line:-2
to present the system image
picker in a standard sheet.


80
00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:39.686 line:-2
When a button is tapped,
this first function is called,


81
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.489 line:-2
which creates an image picker,
sets the picker's delegate


82
00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.858 line:-2
to self,
and then presents the picker.


83
00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:49.796 line:-2
Then when an image is chosen,
the picker didFinishPicking


84
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.933 line:-2
delegate method is called,
which then sets the chosen image


85
00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:55.469 line:-2
on the image view
and dismisses the picker.


86
00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:58.739 line:-1
Let's run it.


87
00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:00.207 line:-1
When I tap the photo button,


88
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.342 line:-2
the photo picker covers
the whole app.


89
00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:05.679 line:-2
Notice my traveling has
recently been very virtual.


90
00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:08.849 line:-2
And when I pick a photo,
the photo picker dismisses,


91
00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:11.718 line:-2
revealing the photo
I picked in the postcard.


92
00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.987 line:-2
But what if I want to pick
a different picture?


93
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.089 line:-2
I have to go through
this whole flow again.


94
00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:17.891 line:-2
And it would be really nice
if I could show


95
00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:19.927 line:-2
my library of photos
and my postcard


96
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.361 line:-1
at the same time.


97
00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:23.397 line:-1
And with a medium detent, I can.


98
00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:28.168 line:-2
Here's the same code as before
but with a few changes.


99
00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:29.703 line:-1
Before I present the picker,


100
00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:32.139 line:-2
I access
its sheetPresentationController


101
00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:35.876 line:-2
and set its detents
to medium and large.


102
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.811 line:-2
Also in the picker
didFinishPicking


103
00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:40.080 line:-2
delegate callback,
I removed the line


104
00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.616 line:-2
that dismisses the photo picker,
because now I don't want


105
00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:45.152 line:-2
the photo picker to dismiss
when selecting a picture.


106
00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:49.556 line:-2
Now when I run this
and tap the photo button,


107
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.658 line:-2
my library comes up
at half height,


108
00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:54.161 line:-1
I can pick a photo, and voila.


109
00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:57.364 line:-2
I can see it in my postcard
with the library still below.


110
00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:59.233 line:-2
And if I want to try
a different photo,


111
00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:02.369 line:-1
it's as simple as one tap.


112
00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:05.772 line:-2
Also, because my detents array
includes the large detent,


113
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.976 line:-2
I can drag the bar to resize
this sheet to full height.


114
00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.112 line:-2
In addition,
because the scroll view


115
00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.114 line:-2
is scrolled to top,
scrolling the scroll view


116
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.149 line:-1
will also expand the sheet.


117
00:05:16.183 --> 00:05:18.619 line:-2
For a sheet of actions
like the system Share Sheet,


118
00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:21.021 line:-2
this is a great feature
that progressively discloses


119
00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:23.757 line:-2
more advanced actions
at the bottom of the list.


120
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.326 line:-2
But for this
photo library example,


121
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.729 line:-2
I might prefer that scrolling
not expand the sheet


122
00:05:28.762 --> 00:05:30.898 line:-2
so the postcard is
always visible


123
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.866 line:-2
unless I explicitly resize
the sheet


124
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.902 line:-1
by dragging from the bar.


125
00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:36.904 line:-1
To get this alternate behavior,


126
00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:39.673 line:-2
I just have to set
one additional property:


127
00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:42.976 line:-2
PrefersScrollingExpands-
WhenScrolledToEdge.


128
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.978 line:-2
By default,
this property is true,


129
00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:47.080 line:-2
so setting it to false
prevents scrolling


130
00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:48.615 line:-1
from expanding the sheet.


131
00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:53.720 line:-2
Now the photo picker
doesn't resize when scrolled,


132
00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:55.022 line:-1
but I can still drag the bar


133
00:05:55.055 --> 00:05:57.224 line:-2
to get a better view
of my photo library.


134
00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:01.028 line:-1
But now when I tap a photo,


135
00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:04.031 line:-2
it's not obvious
that anything happened.


136
00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:06.166 line:-2
This is in contrast
to the earlier behavior,


137
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.402 line:-2
where tapping a photo
dismissed the photo picker,


138
00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:10.771 line:-2
clearly indicating
my selection was received.


139
00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.007 line:-2
What I'd like is
to have the sheet resize


140
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.410 line:-2
to the medium detent
when I tap a photo,


141
00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.879 line:-2
both to indicate
my selection was received


142
00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:21.648 line:-2
and to make my selection
visible in the postcard.


143
00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:23.917 line:-2
And I can achieve this
by programmatically changing


144
00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:26.253 line:-1
the selected detent.


145
00:06:26.286 --> 00:06:28.555 line:-2
So if I go back to the image
picker delegate method


146
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.657 line:-2
that is called
whenever a photo is tapped,


147
00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:33.861 line:-2
I can add some code here to get
the sheetPresentationController


148
00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:36.063 line:-2
and set
the selectedDetentIdentifier


149
00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:37.264 line:-1
to medium.


150
00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:39.900 line:-1
Let's try this.


151
00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:41.935 line:-2
Notice the transition
when I tap a photo.


152
00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:45.038 line:-1
Whoa!


153
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:48.108 line:-2
That transition was so fast,
I almost lost my eyebrows.


154
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.511 line:-2
It actually didn't
animate at all.


155
00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:52.713 line:-2
I can easily animate
this transition


156
00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.281 line:-2
by wrapping the setting
of the property


157
00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:56.717 line:-1
in a sheet.animateChanges block.


158
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.887 line:-2
This will animate the sheet down
to the medium detent if needed


159
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.555 line:-1
with a standard animation curve


160
00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.590 line:-2
and animate other sheets
in the stack as well,


161
00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:05.792 line:-2
such as the root sheet
scaling back up.


162
00:07:10.364 --> 00:07:12.666 line:-1
Buttery smooth.


163
00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.736 line:-2
One more nice thing would be
to remove the dimming view


164
00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:18.639 line:-2
to show the selected photo
in full color.


165
00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:21.208 line:-2
To do that, there's one more
property to look at


166
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:24.111 line:-2
called smallestUndimmed-
DetentIdentifier.


167
00:07:24.144 --> 00:07:26.113 line:-2
By default,
this property is nil,


168
00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:28.148 line:-2
which means
all of the detents are dimmed,


169
00:07:28.182 --> 00:07:29.983 line:-2
but if you want
to remove dimming,


170
00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:32.152 line:-2
set it to the identifier
of the smallest detent


171
00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:33.787 line:-1
where you don't want dimming.


172
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.822 line:-2
In this case,
I'll set it to medium.


173
00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:39.393 line:-2
Notice there's no dimming
at the medium detent


174
00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:41.995 line:-1
when I bring up the picker.


175
00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:43.130 line:-1
Ta-da!


176
00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:46.667 line:-2
But dimming still fades in
if I resize to the large detent.


177
00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:50.604 line:-2
More than visually removing
the dimming,


178
00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.105 line:-1
this property also allows you


179
00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.508 line:-2
to build advanced
nonmodal experiences,


180
00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:55.976 line:-1
since I can now interact


181
00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:58.312 line:-2
not only with the content
in the sheet


182
00:07:58.345 --> 00:08:01.014 line:-2
but also with the content
outside of the sheet.


183
00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:05.219 line:-2
This is even more profound
with the font picker,


184
00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:07.554 line:-2
where I've built a UI
that allows me to select


185
00:08:07.588 --> 00:08:10.224 line:-2
a range of text
while the font picker is up,


186
00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:12.326 line:-1
apply a font to just that range,


187
00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:15.963 line:-2
adjust my selection,
and apply a font again.


188
00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:18.999 line:-2
Download the sample app for
details on how this is achieved.


189
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.936 line:-2
It's also worth noting
that medium height sheets


190
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.138 line:-2
support automatic
keyboard avoidance,


191
00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:28.308 line:-2
so if I search for a font here,
the sheet grows automatically


192
00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:31.378 line:-2
to account for the keyboard,
and when the keyboard dismisses,


193
00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:34.081 line:-2
the sheet automatically
collapses back down.


194
00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:38.352 line:-2
So that was a lot
of information about detents,


195
00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:40.320 line:-2
but now I'd like to turn
our attention


196
00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:42.489 line:-2
to some other new
visual customization options


197
00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:44.157 line:-1
for sheets,


198
00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:46.593 line:-2
starting with a new
optional appearance for sheets


199
00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:48.695 line:-1
on iPhone in landscape.


200
00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:52.699 line:-2
In iOS 13, we made all sheets
full screen in landscape,


201
00:08:52.733 --> 00:08:55.369 line:-2
and now we've made available
an alternate appearance


202
00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.437 line:-2
where sheets are only attached
to the screen


203
00:08:57.471 --> 00:08:58.805 line:-1
at their bottom edge.


204
00:09:00.507 --> 00:09:02.776 line:-2
To get this new appearance,
simply set


205
00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:06.413 line:-2
prefersEdgeAttached-
InCompactHeight to true.


206
00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:08.715 line:-2
Now just setting this
will always give you a sheet


207
00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:10.784 line:-2
that is as wide
as the safe area.


208
00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:12.452 line:-2
If you'd like a sheet
whose width follows


209
00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:15.189 line:-2
the presentedViewControllers
preferredContentSize,


210
00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:17.658 line:-2
set widthFollows-
PreferredContentSize-


211
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:19.760 line:-1
WhenEdgeAttached to true.


212
00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:22.329 line:-2
This will make the sheet
a narrower default width,


213
00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:23.964 line:-2
and you can set
preferredContentSize


214
00:09:23.997 --> 00:09:27.034 line:-1
to further customize this width.


215
00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.702 line:-1
Besides these properties,


216
00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:31.405 line:-2
there is also a property
to show a grabber if you like.


217
00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:33.807 line:-2
A grabber often isn't necessary,
but in cases


218
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.476 line:-2
where it might be less obvious
that a sheet is resizable,


219
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.946 line:-2
such as when scrolling doesn't
resize the sheet,


220
00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:41.248 line:-2
displaying the grabber
can be a helpful indicator


221
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:43.016 line:-1
of resizability.


222
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.186 line:-2
Now notice
the corners of the sheet.


223
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.655 line:-2
Another option we've exposed
is the ability


224
00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:50.791 line:-1
to customize the corner radius.


225
00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:53.193 line:-2
If your app has
a more rounded appearance,


226
00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:55.362 line:-2
you may want
to match that aesthetic.


227
00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:57.431 line:-2
Note that the system
will keep stacked corners


228
00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:00.601 line:-2
looking consistent,
so if this photo picker expands


229
00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:02.236 line:-1
to push back the root sheet,


230
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:05.305 line:-2
the root sheet will have
larger corners to match.


231
00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:07.808 line:-2
Finally, although it's possible
to create a sheet


232
00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:09.376 line:-1
with detents on iPad,


233
00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:11.645 line:-2
often a popover is
wanted instead


234
00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:13.580 line:-2
that adapts
to a sheet in compact,


235
00:10:13.614 --> 00:10:16.283 line:-2
potentially customized
with things like detents.


236
00:10:16.316 --> 00:10:19.620 line:-2
Let's take this approach
with the sample app.


237
00:10:19.653 --> 00:10:22.089 line:-2
To get a popover
for the image picker on iPad,


238
00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:24.925 line:-2
I need to make
a few small modifications.


239
00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.227 line:-2
First, I'll set
the modalPresentationStyle


240
00:10:27.261 --> 00:10:29.329 line:-1
of the picker to popover.


241
00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:32.566 line:-2
Then, instead of grabbing
the sheetPresentationController,


242
00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:34.067 line:-2
because this
will now return nil,


243
00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:36.670 line:-2
since the modalPresentationStyle
is not a sheet,


244
00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:40.307 line:-2
I'll get the
popoverPresentationController.


245
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.377 line:-2
I'll set the popover's source
to be our barButtonItem,


246
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.712 line:-2
and then I'll grab
a new property on the popover


247
00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:48.482 line:-2
called the adaptiveSheet-
PresentationController.


248
00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:50.651 line:-2
This property returns
an instance of the sheet


249
00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:54.388 line:-2
that the popover will adapt to
in compact size classes,


250
00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:57.257 line:-2
and then I'll configure it
just as I did the sheet before.


251
00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:01.495 line:-1
Now when I tap a photo button,


252
00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:03.697 line:-2
the photo picker appears
in the popover,


253
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.299 line:-1
and if I resize the scene,


254
00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:07.367 line:-2
it adapts
to a medium height sheet.


255
00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:09.469 line:-1
It works!


256
00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:12.906 line:-2
And if I expand the picker,
and select a photo--


257
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.074 line:-1
oh, no!


258
00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:16.076 line:-2
It didn't automatically resize
to medium height


259
00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:17.978 line:-1
like we implemented before.


260
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.146 line:-1
Hmm.


261
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.180 line:-1
Let's go back to the picker


262
00:11:20.214 --> 00:11:22.382 line:-2
didFinishPicking
delegate method.


263
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.484 line:-1
Ah!


264
00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:26.653 line:-2
To get the adaptive sheet,
I need to read


265
00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:28.789 line:-2
the adaptiveSheet-
PresentationController


266
00:11:28.822 --> 00:11:30.591 line:-2
on the
popoverPresentationController


267
00:11:30.624 --> 00:11:33.193 line:-1
here in the code as well.


268
00:11:33.227 --> 00:11:36.797 line:-2
Now notice
when I select a photo.


269
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.833 line:-2
Hooray!
It resizes back to medium again.


270
00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:44.204 line:-2
Now, I've talked
about a lot of stuff here


271
00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:46.907 line:-2
that will enable you
to easily build new types of UIs


272
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.077 line:-2
with sheets that could not be
easily built before.


273
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.846 line:-2
Review your own apps
for areas that would benefit


274
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.483 line:-2
from medium height sheets
or nonmodal experiences.


275
00:11:56.517 --> 00:11:59.219 line:-2
If you have any half height
custom cards in your apps today,


276
00:11:59.253 --> 00:12:02.055 line:-2
replace them with these
newly enhanced UIKit sheets.


277
00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:04.224 line:-2
Thank you for watching,
and I look forward to seeing


278
00:12:04.258 --> 00:12:06.360 line:-2
all of the cool new things
you build with sheets.
