Simon Goldrei: Hello!
In this session,


7
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:14.581 line:-1 position:50%
we'll explore how to immerse
your app in spatial audio.


8
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,351 line:-1
I'm Simon and I'm part
of the streaming media team


9
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,986 line:-1
here at Apple.


10
00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:20.687 line:-1 position:50%
Do you want
to offer your customers,


11
00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.456 line:-1 position:50%
and differentiate
your service,


12
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,791 line:-1
with the experience
of a movie theater?


13
00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.127 line:-1 position:50%
Would you like to offer
immersive audio


14
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,496 line:-1
with rendering
of multipoint audio sources


15
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,199 line:-1
that provides that sense
of being there?


16
00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.701 line:-1 position:50%
Can we do all this
from the convenience


17
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:38.272 line:-1 position:50%
of the mobile device
in our customer's pocket?


18
00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:41.975 line:-1 position:50%
In this session, we're going
to explore spatial audio


19
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:46,780 line:-1
and how to deliver it with the
Core AVFoundation playback APIs


20
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,348 line:-1
and WebKit.


21
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,450 line:-1
We've got a full agenda.


22
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.953 line:-1 position:50%
Together we'll cover
what is spatial audio


23
00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:57.424 line:-1 position:50%
by contrasting it to existing
technology we're familiar with.


24
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,327 line:-1
Then we'll enumerate
the technologies and treatments


25
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:03,063 line:-1
that the feature offers.


26
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,832 line:-1
In the second half,
I'll introduce API


27
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:10,103 line:-1
and highlight different
treatments that are applied.


28
00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.839 line:-1 position:50%
Next up, we'll review
the levels of support


29
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,275 line:-1
for spatial audio
in prior releases


30
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,478 line:-1
so that you can target features
appropriately.


31
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,847 line:-1
I'll also reveal
what's new this year


32
00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:24.751 line:-1 position:50%
in our fall 2021 OS releases.


33
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.355 line:-1 position:50%
Then to top it all off,
we'll end with a demo.


34
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,490 line:-1
I'm excited to share that
with you.


35
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,359 line:-1
You're in for a treat!


36
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,394 line:-1
To understand
what is spatial audio,


37
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,331 line:-1
let's start by considering
classic stereo.


38
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:38.398 line:-1 position:50%
Be it headphones


39
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,234 line:-1
or stereo speaker arrangements
of yesteryear,


40
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,771 line:-1
the soundstage we perceive
is rather limited.


41
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,107 line:-1
We don't hear sounds
from behind us,


42
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,643 line:-1
directly in front,
or above us.


43
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:53,246 line:-1
It's missing lifelike,
positional reproduction.


44
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,948 line:-1
And in the case
of headphones,


45
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,286 line:-1
the sound emanates from tiny
speakers in, or on, our heads;


46
00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:02.222 line:-1 position:50%
we call this
an in-head experience.


47
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,292 line:-1
As we naturally move our heads
while watching a movie,


48
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.961 line:-1 position:50%
those tiny speakers
move with us.


49
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.630 line:-1 position:50%
This is not
a theater-like experience,


50
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.101 line:-1 position:50%
but this is where
spatial audio can help.


51
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:18,305 line:-1
Spatial audio offers
a theater-like experience.


52
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,941 line:-1
It's a psychoacoustic technology
that has the effect


53
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:25,045 line:-1
of producing a compelling
virtual soundstage.


54
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,748 line:-1
It works best with
multichannel content


55
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,217 line:-1
but it also offers
a compelling experience


56
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,652 line:-1
for stereo content as well.


57
00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:36.256 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, spatial audio support
is offered for audiovisual


58
00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:39.126 line:-1 position:50%
and audio-only media sources.


59
00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.329 line:-1 position:50%
Best of all, it works with
a variety of Apple products


60
00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.965 line:-1 position:50%
your customers already have.


61
00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.834 line:-1 position:50%
We made it simple to bring
the spatial audio experience


62
00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.803 line:-1 position:50%
to your customers.


63
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:53,040 line:-1
As I just alluded to, the best
way to enjoy spatial audio


64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,045 line:-1
in your applications is to
provide multichannel audio.


65
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,782 line:-1
That experience is most adaptive
to the customer's environment


66
00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:03.784 line:-1 position:50%
when providing HLS variants


67
00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:06.453 line:-1 position:50%
that reference multichannel
audio alternates.


68
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,890 line:-1
In fact, you may already have
in your content library


69
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,626 line:-1
multichannel audio source media.


70
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,762 line:-1
Simply publishing this
will enable, by default,


71
00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.398 line:-1 position:50%
spatial audio
in your application.


72
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,402 line:-1
There's absolutely no
software change needed.


73
00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:25.372 line:-1 position:50%
Multichannel audio tracks
in regular media files --


74
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:29,309 line:-1
and WebKit's MSE
in the fall 2021 releases --


75
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:34,014 line:-1
also benefit from limited
support that I'll detail later.


76
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,016 line:-1
Let me tell you
about media experiences


77
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,251 line:-1
you can now expect to create.


78
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:40.887 line:-1 position:50%
There's so many experiences
you can now recreate


79
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,389 line:-1
with spatial audio.


80
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.858 line:-1 position:50%
You can deliver music
that surrounds us,


81
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,327 line:-1
that feels like
being at the concert.


82
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,763 line:-1
You can build
full-motion video games


83
00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:51.531 line:-1 position:50%
with interactive scenes
that take gamers


84
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,101 line:-1
on their own
immersive adventures.


85
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:57.504 line:-1 position:50%
But how does
this technology work?


86
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:01,608 line:-1
When spatial audio is used, the
virtual soundstage is static.


87
00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.244 line:-1 position:50%
The soundstage doesn't move
with casual head movement,


88
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.713 line:-1 position:50%
unlike we saw earlier
with stereo.


89
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,716 line:-1
What we get is the same
audible effect and feeling


90
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,651 line:-1
we expect from the theater.


91
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.121 line:-1 position:50%
This effect is possible
both from the built-in speakers


92
00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:15.789 line:-1 position:50%
in many of our products


93
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:20,360 line:-1
and now is also available
in select headphone products.


94
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.863 line:-1 position:50%
When spatial-capable
headphones are used,


95
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,831 line:-1
measurements from
inertial measurement units


96
00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:26.867 line:-1 position:50%
in the playback device
are compared with


97
00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.002 line:-1 position:50%
similar measurements
in the headphones


98
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,838 line:-1
to determine the customer's
head pose.


99
00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:34.908 line:-1 position:50%
This is used to dynamically
alter the audio rendering


100
00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:38.145 line:-1 position:50%
to maintain that static
soundstage effect.


101
00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:41.348 line:-1 position:50%
The result is a feeling
like the audio is emanating


102
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,950 line:-1
from the original placement
around the camera,


103
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,953 line:-1
or listener,
for an out-of-head experience.


104
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:51,391 line:-1
It even works on a turning bus
or a banking airplane.


105
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:55.328 line:-1 position:50%
We also offer a technique
to up-mix stereo sources


106
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,798 line:-1
to reproduce
a 5.1 channel experience.


107
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,735 line:-1
We provide this feature
to offer spatial audio


108
00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:04.838 line:-1 position:50%
along with your existing library
of stereo content.


109
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,674 line:-1
For supported headphones,
it is the default


110
00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:11.311 line:-1 position:50%
stereo treatment
in our fall 2021 releases.


111
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,048 line:-1
We also use this treatment
implicitly to make spatial audio


112
00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:18.618 line:-1 position:50%
even more compelling
for you to adopt and offer,


113
00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:22.189 line:-1 position:50%
because right about now,
you're probably thinking


114
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,057 line:-1
that distributing
multichannel audio


115
00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:26.726 line:-1 position:50%
might impede the visual quality
of your media.


116
00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:30.030 line:-1 position:50%
After all, multichannel audio
is much higher bitrate


117
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.167 line:-1 position:50%
than the stereo AAC renditions
you offer today.


118
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:37.270 line:-1 position:50%
How can you possibly
fit both in a constrained


119
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.406 line:-1 position:50%
network bandwidth
environment?


120
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,875 line:-1
This a real problem.


121
00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:44.711 line:-1 position:50%
We solved this by making
the spatial audio experience


122
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.314 line:-1 position:50%
adaptive to your customer's
bandwidth.


123
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,349 line:-1
When bandwidth
is insufficient to deliver


124
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,052 line:-1
a high-quality audiovisual
experience,


125
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,622 line:-1
the audio seamlessly degrades
to a stereo, up-mixed --


126
00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:58.058 line:-1 position:50%
but a still spatial --
treatment.


127
00:05:58.058 --> 00:06:00.627 line:-1 position:50%
Head-tracking, if offered
before the transition,


128
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,462 line:-1
is maintained.


129
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,899 line:-1
Soon after, when bandwidth
reliably recovers,


130
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:09,970 line:-1
the full multichannel
spatial treatment is restored.


131
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.906 line:-1 position:50%
With this adaptive
spatial audio experience,


132
00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:15.242 line:-1 position:50%
it is ever more important
to both normalize


133
00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:19.212 line:-1 position:50%
the volume levels between stereo
and multichannel renditions.


134
00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.948 line:-1 position:50%
In addition,
please provide DRC --


135
00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:23.450 line:-1 position:50%
Dynamic Range Control --


136
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.553 line:-1 position:50%
and dialnorm metadata
in your media encodings


137
00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.622 line:-1 position:50%
as is appropriate.


138
00:06:28.622 --> 00:06:30.323 line:-1 position:50%
This is described in more detail


139
00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:32.525 line:-1 position:50%
in the HLS Authoring
Specification


140
00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:35.962 line:-1 position:50%
available at
developer.apple.com.


141
00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:39.399 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a look now
at the interfaces you can use


142
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.302 line:-1 position:50%
to tailor the spatial audio
experience.


143
00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:44.471 line:-1 position:50%
To customize the default
spatial audio experience


144
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,039 line:-1
in your application --


145
00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:50.310 line:-1 position:50%
be it via AVPlayerItem or now,
AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer --


146
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.948 line:-1 position:50%
you specify one of four
AVAudioSpatializationFormats.


147
00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:56.783 line:-1 position:50%
These are to permit
the spatialization


148
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,319 line:-1
of mono and stereo,
multichannel,


149
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,021 line:-1
and the combination
of the last two --


150
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,155 line:-1
that is mono, stereo,


151
00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:05.225 line:-1 position:50%
and multichannel
source audio formats.


152
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,929 line:-1
You can also specify zero
to inhibit audio spatialization.


153
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,300 line:-1
Do note that our platforms
provide system-level controls


154
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,802 line:-1
for customers to tailor
the experience further,


155
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,804 line:-1
depending on the type
of audio route,


156
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,374 line:-1
through Control Center
and Bluetooth settings.


157
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,810 line:-1
We take one of these four values
and set it on the


158
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.446 line:-1 position:50%
allowedAudioSpatialization
Formats property


159
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:31.484 line:-1 position:50%
on an AVPlayerItem and now,
new in our fall 2021 releases,


160
00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:34.321 line:-1 position:50%
an AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer.


161
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:38.425 line:-1 position:50%
Now, you may be wondering,
how do you use AVFoundation APIs


162
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:41,628 line:-1
to discover if an audio route
supports spatial audio?


163
00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:44.931 line:-1 position:50%
How do you know if you should
deliver multichannel audio to


164
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:48.401 line:-1 position:50%
your AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer
instance?


165
00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:51.338 line:-1 position:50%
Well, in the fall 2021 releases,


166
00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:53.807 line:-1 position:50%
we're introducing a property
that indicates this


167
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,676 line:-1
on an
AVAudioSessionPortDescription.


168
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,714 line:-1
In addition, on AVAudioSession,
we're introducing a mechanism


169
00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:03.016 line:-1 position:50%
for you to advertise
to the system


170
00:08:03.016 --> 00:08:06.686 line:-1 position:50%
that your application is able
to offer multichannel audio.


171
00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.822 line:-1 position:50%
This indication is shown
if the customers


172
00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.757 line:-1 position:50%
haven't enabled
the spatial audio treatment


173
00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:13.727 line:-1 position:50%
in Control Center
or Bluetooth preferences.


174
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,596 line:-1
Note that if your application
uses AVPlayer,


175
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,099 line:-1
these indications
are managed for you.


176
00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:22.802 line:-1 position:50%
The isSpatialAudioEnabled
property indicates that the port


177
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,038 line:-1
is capable of both
rendering spatial audio


178
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,774 line:-1
and that the customer
permits it.


179
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,777 line:-1
You are encouraged to observe
route change notifications


180
00:08:30.777 --> 00:08:33.146 line:-1 position:50%
and to check
isSpatialAudioEnabled


181
00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:35.148 line:-1 position:50%
at each event.


182
00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:37.684 line:-1 position:50%
Similarly, AVAudioSession
will emit


183
00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.954 line:-1 position:50%
a spatialPlaybackCapabilities
ChangedNotification


184
00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:43.423 line:-1 position:50%
when the customer
alters the spatial preferences


185
00:08:43.423 --> 00:08:46.760 line:-1 position:50%
in Control Center
and Bluetooth settings.


186
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.996 line:-1 position:50%
As a convenience, this
notification carries information


187
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,699 line:-1
about the state of spatial audio
enablement.


188
00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:56.770 line:-1 position:50%
Use the AVAudioSession
SpatialAudioEnabledKey


189
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,074 line:-1
to retrieve the state as it
pertains to this notification.


190
00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:04.377 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, to indicate
to the system that your software


191
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,046 line:-1
or service can provide
multichannel content,


192
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,316 line:-1
you call the function
setSupportsMultichannelContent


193
00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:12.285 line:-1 position:50%
with your intent.


194
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,987 line:-1
This is used
to relay to the customer


195
00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:16.122 line:-1 position:50%
that a spatial experience
is available


196
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:20,827 line:-1
if network conditions permit
and if the treatment is enabled.


197
00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:22.595 line:-1 position:50%
Let's now survey
the feature support


198
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,465 line:-1
across the last three
release years.


199
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:29,135 line:-1
In macOS Catalina,
iOS and iPad OS 13,


200
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,271 line:-1
spatial audio is offered
via built-in speakers


201
00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:34.307 line:-1 position:50%
with AVPlayerItem
and the WebKit video tag


202
00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:37.911 line:-1 position:50%
by specifying any URL
with an http scheme.


203
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.714 line:-1 position:50%
It is available to customers
with 2018 and later year model


204
00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:46.019 line:-1 position:50%
MacBook, iPhone,
and iPad Pro product lines.


205
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,521 line:-1
The default is to offer
spatialization by selecting


206
00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:51.658 line:-1 position:50%
multichannel audio renditions
where available.


207
00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:55.595 line:-1 position:50%
In macOS Big Sur,
iOS and iPad OS 14,


208
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,998 line:-1
we introduced support for
the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max


209
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,501 line:-1
head-track-capable headphones.


210

Spatialization capabilities
via these accessories


211
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:09,309 line:-1
is offered to 2016 and later
iPhone- and iPad-paired devices.


212
00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:11.444 line:-1 position:50%
The default remains
to offer spatialization


213
00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:16.416 line:-1 position:50%
by selecting multichannel audio
renditions where available.


214
00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:19.719 line:-1 position:50%
That brings us to the all-new
support in macOS Monterey,


215
00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:24.624 line:-1 position:50%
iOS, iPadOS,
and now, tvOS 15.


216
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,260 position:50%
Here we offer support

for W3C Media Source Extensions,

219
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,070 line:0
The MSE path offers no interface


220
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,506 line:0
to tailor the spatialization
experience.


221
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,709 position:50%
However, there does exist
an interface to detect


222
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,777 position:50%
the availability
of spatial audio support


223
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,146 position:50%
via the AudioConfiguration
dictionary


224
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,750 position:50%
within the Media Capabilities
API set.


225
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,685 line:0
The default in these releases


226
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,321 position:50%
is to offer audio spatialization
by default


227
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,591 position:50%
for all of mono, stereo,
and multichannel sources


228
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,394 position:50%
where available
and conditions permit.


229

For audio-only presentations,


230
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,299 position:50%
including all AVSampleBuffer
AudioRenderer uses,


231
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,434 position:50%
only multichannel
audio renditions


232
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,904 line:0
are offered the treatment
by default.


233
00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:13.740 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we know
what spatial audio is


234
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.410 line:-1 position:50%
