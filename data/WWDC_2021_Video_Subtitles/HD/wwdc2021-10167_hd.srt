My colleague Jack and I
are going to talk about


10
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:20,754 line:-1
how to elevate your
DocC documentation in Xcode.


11
00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.689 line:-1 position:50%
It’s now easier than ever


12
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,759 line:-1
to write and share
great documentation.


13
00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.061 line:-1 position:50%
This year, we’ve integrated
documentation


14
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:32,532 line:-1
for your Swift frameworks
right into Xcode 13.


15
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,238 line:-1
of a framework we created:
SlothCreator.


16
00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:39.373 line:-1 position:50%
You can use SlothCreator


17
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,575 line:-1
to catalog sloths
you find in nature


18
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:45,312 line:-1
and to create new
adorable virtual sloths.


19
00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.114 line:-1 position:50%
To make our existing
documentation


20
00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:48.782 line:-1 position:50%
for this framework better,


21
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:52,519 line:-1
we'll go over what documentation
page types are available


22
00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.754 line:-1 position:50%
in Xcode 13


23
00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:57.491 line:-1 position:50%
and how to choose
what's best for your content,


24
00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:00.427 line:-1 position:50%
how to organize
the order of your APIs


25
00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:03.597 line:-1 position:50%
to tell a story
about your framework,


26
00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:05.999 line:-1 position:50%
and how extensions
can give you flexibility


27
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,002 line:-1
in how you write
your documentation.


28
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.405 line:-1 position:50%
I’ll start with
a new Xcode feature:


29
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,942 line:-1
documentation page types.


30
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:19,880 position:50%
Xcode 13 has a brand-new feature
called "Documentation Catalog,"


31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,116 line:0
which enables you to create
three page types you can view


32
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,320 line:0
on the documentation window
or on the web:


33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,623 line:0
reference, articles,
and tutorials.


34
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,392 position:50%
Each project is unique
and has different needs,


35
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:36,897 line:0
but it’s usually good to have
a diverse set of documentation.


36
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:40,100 line:0
Reference provides concise,
in-depth information


37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,303 line:0
about individual APIs
in your library.


38
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,806 line:0
This allows you to add
text descriptions,


39
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:49,476 position:50%
code snippets, and relationships
between different symbols.


40
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,914 position:50%
This is the backbone
of your documentation.


41
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,117 line:0
Articles are pages
with free-form content.


42
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,655 position:50%
They’re great at giving the big
picture of how a framework works


43
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:05,459 line:0
and explaining how to complete
a specific task.


44
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,930 position:50%
They often connect the dots
between different symbols.


45
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,200 line:0
Tutorials are a step-by-step
walk-through of a project


46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,168 line:0
that uses your framework.


47
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,436 position:50%
It's great to understand


48
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,739 position:50%
how a combination
of symbols work together


49
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,141 line:0
by implementing it in practice.


50
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,643 line:0
Framework adopters
of all proficiency levels


51
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,480 position:50%
can benefit from tutorials,
but it’s worth noting


52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,118 line:0
this is also a very
beginner-friendly format.


53
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:35,489 position:50%
In this session,
we’ll focus on articles.


54
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,258 line:0
To see information
on reference and tutorials,


55
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,895 position:50%
check out these other
WWDC sessions.


56
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,232 line:-1
Before I start enhancing
my SlothCreator documentation,


57
00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:49.136 line:-1 position:50%
I’ll check out what’s new
in the documentation window.


58
00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:53.373 line:-1 position:50%
Now, you can see
all of the Apple technologies


59
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,242 line:-1
as well as your own
documentation


60
00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:58.245 line:-1 position:50%
right there in the navigator.


61
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,380 line:-1
Now, I’ll check out
the current state


62
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,883 line:-1
of my SlothCreator
documentation.


63
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:07,020 line:-1
I have my SlothCreator
Swift package open in Xcode.


64
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,955 line:-1
I'm going to click on Product


65
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,324 line:-1
and then Build Documentation


66
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,928 line:-1
to bring up
my documentation window.


67
00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:16.496 line:-1 position:50%
Scrolling through
my SlothCreator


68
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,498 line:-1
framework documentation,


69
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,034 line:-1
I see that all my symbols
are already covered


70
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,336 line:-1
by reference here,
which is great.


71
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,873 line:-1
However, if I approach this page
from the perspective of someone


72
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,509 line:-1
who's never used
this framework before,


73
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,846 line:-1
it's not clear at a glance
what it does.


74
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:37,784 line:0
I can use a top-level article
to paint the big picture.


75
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:42,522 position:50%
Top-level articles have
a concise summary sentence,


76
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:47,360 position:50%
an overview with content
like images and code snippets,


77
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,895 line:0
and on the bottom,


78
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:53,166 line:0
a topics section with a few
symbols you want to highlight.


79
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,668 line:-1
To add an article,


80
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:59,306 line:-1
I need to set up my project
with a documentation catalog.


81
00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:03.510 line:-1 position:50%
The documentation catalog
is a file in the Xcode navigator


82
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,446 line:-1
that contains
all my documentation files.


83
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,349 line:-1
Moreover, it lets me write
new page types.


84
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,853 line:-1
This makes documentation
quick to access at a glance


85
00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:16.389 line:-1 position:50%
and makes it easier for me
to prioritize documentation


86
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,825 line:-1
in my day-to-day workflow.


87
00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.660 line:-1 position:50%
To do this,
I can right-click


88
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,396 line:-1
on the SlothCreator
Sources directory,


89
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,466 line:-1
which contains the sources
for our SlothCreator target,


90
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,970 line:-1
and select New File.


91
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.905 line:-1 position:50%
Then, I’ll scroll
through the list


92
00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:38.044 line:-1 position:50%
until I find
Documentation Catalog.


93
00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:40.580 line:-1 position:50%
I’ll name it to match
my framework target:


94
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,250 line:-1
SlothCreator.


95
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,418 line:-1
Xcode gives me
a top-level article


96
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,221 line:-1
when I create
a documentation catalog.


97
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:52.626 line:-1 position:50%
I’ll rename it
to "SlothCreator"


98
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:57,397 line:-1
both in the project navigator
and in the markdown.


99
00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:00.367 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let’s get started
on our article.


100
00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:03.370 line:-1 position:50%
You write articles
using Markdown.


101
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,605 line:-1
First, I’m going
to add a summary


102
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:11,645 line:-1
that describes what my framework
does in one sentence.


103
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,314 line:-1
Next, I'll add more
in-depth information


104
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.751 line:-1 position:50%
under the Overview title
about the main functionalities


105
00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:22.856 line:-1 position:50%
of SlothCreator: research,
care, and visualization.


106
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,724 line:-1
Lastly, I’m going
to add an image


107
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,528 line:-1
so developers know at a glance
what they’re looking at.


108
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,199 position:50%
I’d recommend adding images
that are 2x in resolution


109
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,537 line:0
and either Dark Mode-compatible
or have a Dark Mode alternative.


110
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,106 line:-1
Don’t forget to include
the proper naming conventions


111
00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:42.442 line:-1 position:50%
for your files.


112
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,079 line:-1
First, the name of your file:
"sloth."


113
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,348 line:-1
Then, if your image
is in Dark Mode,


114
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,484 line:-1
a tilde and the word "dark."


115
00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:55.956 line:-1 position:50%
Then, @2x to describe
the scale factor.


116
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,425 line:-1
And lastly,
your image file format,


117
00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:02.262 line:-1 position:50%
which in this case
is .png.


118
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:05,098 line:-1
Now that I made sure
my images are the right size


119
00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:08.868 line:-1 position:50%
and are named correctly,
I’m going to open Finder


120
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,005 line:-1
and drag my assets
into the Resources folder


121
00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:15.075 line:-1 position:50%
of my documentation catalog.


122
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.783 line:-1 position:50%
Next, I’ll add my image
to the article Markdown.


123
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,519 line:0
First, I added
an exclamation point,


124
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,055 position:50%
then a description
between brackets


125
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,924 position:50%
to make my image accessible,


126
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:35,395 position:50%
and lastly, the file name
between parentheses.


127
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,630 line:0
You might have noticed


128
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,899 line:0
I didn’t type in "@2x"
or "~dark."


129
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,036 position:50%
That’s because Xcode
automatically selects the image,


130
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:46,940 line:0
so all I have to type in
is the image name itself.


131
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,476 line:-1
All right, I finished
my top-level article.


132
00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:53.480 line:-1 position:50%
Let’s see what it looks like
by building my documentation.


133
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.217 line:-1 position:50%
I’ll click on Product and select
Build Documentation again


134
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:02,322 line:-1
to bring up
my documentation window.


135
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:06,860 line:-1
Awesome, SlothCreator has
a clear high-level summary,


136
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,095 line:-1
an overview
that gives more context


137
00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:12.332 line:-1 position:50%
on what this framework is for,


138
00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:14.567 line:-1 position:50%
and an image that illustrates


139
00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:17.804 line:-1 position:50%
the core concept
of the framework at a glance.


140
00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:21.007 line:-1 position:50%
Now, someone that’s never used
SlothCreator before


141
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,976 line:-1
can quickly understand
the big picture


142
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,245 line:-1
of what the framework does.


143
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,747 line:-1
I can make this documentation
even better


144
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,450 line:-1
by providing actionable
first steps


145
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,453 line:-1
on how to get started
with SlothCreator.


146
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,488 line:-1
A task article
could help with that.


147
00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.957 line:-1 position:50%
I’ve prepared a task article
ahead of time,


148
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,026 line:-1
and I’m going to open Finder


149
00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:46.032 line:-1 position:50%
and drag it into my SlothCreator
documentation catalog.


150
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,172 line:-1
This article has the goal
of teaching folks


151
00:07:52.172 --> 00:07:54.341 line:-1 position:50%
how to create and care
for a sloth,


152
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,444 line:-1
the core element
of this framework.


153
00:07:57.444 --> 00:07:58.778 line:-1 position:50%
In terms of structure,


154
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,348 line:-1
it’s very similar
to the top-level article.


155
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:05,051 line:-1
Both types can include text,
images, and code snippets.


156
00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:07.921 line:-1 position:50%
The biggest difference here
is in the content.


157
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,890 line:-1
To see those differences, I’ll
build my documentation again


158
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,895 line:-1
by selecting Product
and Build Documentation.


159
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,868 line:-1
Then, in my documentation
window navigator,


160
00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:27.874 line:-1 position:50%
I’m going to select
Getting Started with Sloths.


161
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,610 line:-1
Great, this article
provides more context


162
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,612 line:-1
around how to create a sloth,


163
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,148 line:-1
by describing its properties
and traits.


164
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,918 line:-1
It also gives actionable steps
on how to care for the sloth


165
00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:41.488 line:-1 position:50%
and form a suitable habitat.


166
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:45,825 line:-1
This will help people to adopt
SlothCreator much faster.


167
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,826 position:50%
To recap,


168
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:50,397 position:50%
so far, I talked about all the
different types of documentation


169
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:54,300 line:0
you can author and what you can
use each one for.


170
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,470 line:0
I introduced
a new Xcode 13 feature


171
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,539 position:50%
called "Documentation Catalog,"


172
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,342 position:50%
which allows you to put all
your documentation files


173
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,643 position:50%
in the same place


174
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:07,881 line:0
as well as author new types
of documentation.


175
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,583 position:50%
And I used it
to create two articles


176
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,753 line:0
that enhance my documentation
by giving it more context


177
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:17,190 line:0
and diving in a specific task.


178
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,993 position:50%
To author those articles,
I used Markdown


179
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:24,731 line:0
and the new files that we’re now
supporting for documentation.


180
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,966 line:-1
Now, I'm going to hand it over
to Jack,


181
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:30,470 line:-1
so he can talk about how you can
make your docs even better


182
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.138 line:-1 position:50%
by organizing your symbols


183
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,508 line:-1
and creating documentation
extensions.


184
00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:37.944 line:-1 position:50%
Jack Lawrence: Thanks, Bea,
those articles look great.


185
00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:39.546 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we’ve added
some new pages,


186
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,614 line:-1
there’s another way
I can help guide everyone


187
00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.483 line:-1 position:50%
through the framework.


188
00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:45.652 line:-1 position:50%
Earlier, Bea created
a framework page


189
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,288 line:-1
with an overview
for SlothCreator.


190
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,856 line:0
At the bottom of the page,


191
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:53,193 position:50%
the DocC compiler automatically
created a topics section


192
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,229 position:50%
with all of the Sloth
framework’s documentation.


193
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,632 position:50%
This is a great start,
but I think we can improve it.


194
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,168 position:50%
So let’s take a step back
and think about the story


195
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,604 position:50%
we want to tell.


196
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,475 position:50%
SlothCreator APIs fall
into three main categories:


197
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,777 line:0
researching and creating sloths,


198
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,379 line:0
caring for the health
and happiness of your sloth,


199
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,149 position:50%
and viewing your sloth
in its habitat.


200
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,584 position:50%
I can use these categories


201
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:23,156 position:50%
to organize the documentation
pages in SlothCreator.


202
00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:26.259 line:-1 position:50%
Here are the top-level pages
for the framework.


203
00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:29.295 line:-1 position:50%
First, I’ll put aside all
but the most important pages.


204
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,030 line:-1
I can organize
supporting types --


205
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.732 line:-1 position:50%
like speed and color --


206
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,035 line:-1
under another page later.


207
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,404 line:-1
Next, I’ll organize
the remaining pages


208
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:43,877 line:-1
into groupings centered around
the features of SlothCreator.


209
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,179 line:-1
And finally, I’ll sort
the groups and pages


210
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,583 line:-1
from least to most advanced.


211
00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:53.586 line:-1 position:50%
This new organization looks
a lot more approachable,


212
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,623 line:-1
and framework adopters
interested in specific features


213
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,192 line:-1
will know right where to look.


214
00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:00.793 line:-1 position:50%
Now we’ll update
the documentation


215
00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:04.163 line:-1 position:50%
for the framework
to use these themes.


216
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,232 line:-1
I have the SlothCreator
project open


217
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,434 line:-1
and the built documentation.


218
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,337 line:-1
The compiler automatically adds
a topics section to each page


219
00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.872 line:-1 position:50%
with default groups.


220
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,609 line:-1
But I can customize it
with some extra Markdown.


221
00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:19.379 line:-1 position:50%
Earlier, Bea created
a documentation catalog


222
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,813 line:-1
with a framework article.


223
00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:22.148 line:-1 position:50%
In the project navigator,


224
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,417 line:-1
I’ll select the SlothCreator
Markdown file


225
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,186 line:-1
inside
the documentation catalog.


226
00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:29.622 line:-1 position:50%
The template already includes
a topics section


227
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:30,890 line:-1
for me to fill out.


228
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,592 line:-1
Starting with "Essentials,"


229
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:36,563 line:-1
I’ll update the group title
in the third-level heading.


230
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,766 line:-1
Then I’ll add a list of links
to include in the group.


231
00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.568 line:-1 position:50%
I’ll begin with
the "Getting Started" article,


232
00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:43.269 line:-1 position:50%
and the sloth type.


233
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,437 position:50%
To link to an article,


234
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,240 position:50%
I use the name of the file
without the extension,


235
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,510 position:50%
using the doc URL scheme.


236
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,911 line:0
To link to a symbol,


237
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:56,749 line:0
I surround the name of the
symbol in double back ticks.


238
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,952 position:50%
Using the categories
I created earlier,


239
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,788 position:50%
I’ll organize all of the other
documentation pages into groups,


240
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,524 line:0
as well.


241
00:12:04.524 --> 00:12:07.427 line:-1 position:50%
Now I’ll rebuild and take a look
at the changes.


242
00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:08.728 line:-1 position:50%
In the Product menu,


243
00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:13.866 line:-1 position:50%
I’ll select Build Documentation
to rebuild.


244
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,201 position:50%
The documentation built,


245
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,937 line:0
but I see a diagnostic
generated by DocC,


246
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:21,274 position:50%
And it looks like I mistyped
a link here.


247
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,109 position:50%
Let’s let autocomplete
take care of it,


248
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:27,180 line:0
so I’m certain it’s correct.


249
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,649 line:-1
Now I’m going to rebuild
the documentation again


250
00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:33.252 line:-1 position:50%
using the Product menu to see
if I resolved all of the issues.


251
00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:38.658 line:-1 position:50%
Awesome, no more warnings.


252
00:12:38.658 --> 00:12:40.927 line:-1 position:50%
On the framework page
in the documentation window,


253
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,296 line:-1
our new "Getting Started"
article is the first topic


254
00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:44.597 line:-1 position:50%
everyone will see,


255
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.599 line:-1 position:50%
followed by the main themes
for SlothCreator


256
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.167 line:-1 position:50%
in order of complexity.


257
00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:51.137 line:-1 position:50%
The documentation navigator
on the left also updates


258
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,139 line:-1
to match each page’s
topics section,


259
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,009 line:-1
so I can quickly find the page
I’m looking for.


260
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,379 line:-1
Now let’s review how to organize
your documentation.


261
00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:01.681 line:-1 position:50%
All of your pages
are organized automatically,


262
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:05.551 line:-1 position:50%
and you can customize
with a topics section.


263
00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.320 line:-1 position:50%
To create a topics section,


264
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.590 line:-1 position:50%
add a second-level
topics heading.


265
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,026 line:-1
Then, add a group
with a third-level heading,


266
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,895 line:-1
followed by a list of links
to any other pages


267
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:19,265 line:-1
that you want to organize
under the current page.


268
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,501 line:-1
You can add a topics section
to any article,


269
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,236 line:-1
along with any container symbol


270
00:13:23.236 --> 00:13:27.407 line:-1 position:50%
like a class, structure,
enumeration, or protocol.


271
00:13:27.407 --> 00:13:28.841 line:-1 position:50%
When you’re organizing
documentation


272
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:30.076 line:-1 position:50%
for your framework,


273
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,311 line:-1
consider the most important
features and themes,


274
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:37,450 line:-1
and which APIs developers might
use together to create an app.


275
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.219 line:-1 position:50%
Move supporting pages under
your primary documentation


276
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,723 line:-1
to add focus and clarity.


277
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,158 line:-1
And start with the basics


278
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,261 line:-1
and then introduce complexity
progressively.


279
00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:50.797 line:-1 position:50%
Now that I’ve customized the
groups on the framework page,


280
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:54,033 line:-1
I want to organize all of the
documentation in SlothCreator,


281
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,836 line:-1
including types
and their members.


282
00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.872 line:-1 position:50%
Documentation extensions
give me the flexibility


283
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,476 line:-1
to choose how I write
documentation for my APIs.


284
00:14:03.476 --> 00:14:07.013 line:-1 position:50%
I could add a custom topics
section right in my source code,


285
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,116 line:-1
but I think it would be easier
to review and maintain over time


286
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:14,120 line:-1
if this additional documentation
was in a separate file.


287
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.825 line:-1 position:50%
And I can use a documentation
extension to do just that.


288
00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:21.761 line:-1 position:50%
First, I create
a new Markdown file.


289
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:26.499 line:-1 position:50%
I associate it with an API
using link syntax in the title.


290
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:30,069 line:-1
Next, to improve the focus
and clarity in my source code,


291
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:31.771 line:-1 position:50%
I’ll leave
the primary content --


292
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,473 line:-1
like the summary
and discussion --


293
00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:37.543 line:-1 position:50%
in the code and extract
the topics section.


294
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,150 line:-1
When DocC builds, it merges
each source comment


295
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.219 line:-1 position:50%
and corresponding
documentation extension


296
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,255 line:-1
into a single
documentation page.


297
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,256 line:-1
With extensions,


298
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,059 line:-1
it’s simple to write
and review the documentation,


299
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,428 line:-1
improve the framework’s
generated interface,


300
00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:56.963 line:-1 position:50%
and provide a better


301
00:14:56.963 --> 00:14:59.198 line:-1 position:50%
documentation
reading experience.


302
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,334 line:-1
Now, I’ll add
a documentation extension


303
00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:04.437 line:-1 position:50%
to enhance the documentation
for SlothCreator.


304
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,539 line:0
First, I’ll take a look
at the Sloth page


305
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,808 line:0
before I make any changes.


306
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,943 position:50%
I have the documentation
comment for the Sloth type,


307
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:15,481 position:50%
and I also have
the built documentation.


308
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,917 line:-1
The documentation I wrote
in the source code looks great,


309
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.919 line:-1 position:50%
but the Topics section
could be improved,


310
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,323 line:-1
and I can do that in
a documentation extension.


311
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,025 position:50%
In the project navigator,


312
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,960 line:0
I’ll right-click
on the documentation catalog


313
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,531 position:50%
to add a new file.


314
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:32,899 line:0
In the template chooser,


315
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:39,038 line:0
I’ll select the Extension File
template and name it "Sloth."


316
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,175 line:-1
Next, I’ll connect the extension
file to the sloth type


317
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,177 line:-1
using a link in the title.


318
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:48,181 line:-1
I need to include the name
of the module in the URL.


319
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,453 line:-1
This might look familiar,


320
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,190 line:-1
because earlier my colleague Bea
used this syntax


321
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,326 line:-1
to create the top-level
framework article.


322
00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:06.065 line:-1 position:50%
Then I’ll add some customized
groups in a topics section.


323
00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:09.502 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, I’ll rebuild using
Product > Build Documentation


324
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,504 line:-1
to check out the result.


325
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,976 position:50%
The content I wrote
in the source code


326
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,244 line:0
is still at the top,


327
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:21,147 position:50%
and the topics section I created
in the documentation file


328
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,849 line:0
is added after it.


329
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,418 position:50%
When I expand the page
in the navigator,


330
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:30,223 position:50%
the navigator's updated as well.


331
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,325 line:-1
The changes that Bea
and I made are done,


332
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,393 line:-1
and we’re ready to share them
with the world.


333
00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.929 line:-1 position:50%
The documentation
looks great in Xcode,


334
00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:40.867 line:-1 position:50%
and anyone can build it after
they download the Swift package.


335
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,269 line:-1
I can also use the Export button
in the navigator


336
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.371 line:-1 position:50%
to export an archive
that you can use


337
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,406 line:-1
to browse the documentation
in Xcode


338
00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:51.444 line:-1 position:50%
without downloading or building
the Swift package.


339
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,980 line:-1
And if I want to make it
accessible to everyone,


340
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,250 line:-1
I can even publish the
documentation on the web.


341
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,720 position:50%
And you can check out this
related session to learn more.


342
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.756 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let’s review how you can
elevate the documentation


343
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,558 line:-1
for your Swift framework.


344
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,461 line:-1
First, create articles
to introduce your framework


345
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,163 line:-1
and explain how your APIs
work together.


346
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,565 line:-1
Next,


347
00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:17.670 line:-1 position:50%
organize your documentation into
groups to improve navigation.


348
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.740 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, add depth and detail
to your API reference


349
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.209 line:-1 position:50%
in documentation
extension files.


350
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,244 line:0
If you want to go even further,


351
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,979 line:0
you can learn
how to publish to the web


352
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,382 line:0
and guide readers
step-by-step with tutorials


353
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,285 line:0
in these two related sessions.


354
00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:35.421 line:-1 position:50%
Xcode 13 is a huge update
for documentation,


355
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,890 line:-1
and we’re so excited
to see what you publish.


356
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,592 line:-1
Thanks for watching!
