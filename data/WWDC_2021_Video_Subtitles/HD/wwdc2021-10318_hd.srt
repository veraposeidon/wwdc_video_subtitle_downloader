about making apps accessible


45

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:07.327 line:-2 align:center
[Saqib] Yeah,
I remember once there was


48
00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:10.197 line:-2 align:center
an app that was
completely inaccessible


49
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,665 line:-1
because there weren’t labels

with the developer,

to some resources

why this was a problem.

And with, you know,
just a day’s work,


55
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.312 line:-1 align:center
he was able to add those labels,

became mostly accessible.

how can I test this

I’d use the Notes app
to communicate to the driver,

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:39.413 line:-2 align:center
but the text was so tiny,
and the drivers


104
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,281 line:-2
had a hard time reading it,
and I thought,


105
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,550 line:-2
"I really need something
that can enlarge the text


106
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:46,153 line:-2
and make it easy to read
and speed up our communication."


107
