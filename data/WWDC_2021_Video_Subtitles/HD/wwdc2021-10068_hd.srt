participants like this,

This is where
we’ll be starting from.


112
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,706 line:-1
We're going to be touching
four files today.


113
00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:34.241 line:-1 position:50%
First is the AppDelegate.


114
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.876 line:-1 position:50%

we're going to be interacting


115
00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:38.211 line:-1 position:50%
with CareKit’s store.


116
00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:40.380 line:-1 position:50%
Over in Surveys.swift,


117
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.085 line:-1 position:50%
we’ll be writing out some
surveys using ResearchKit.


118
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,754 line:-1
Next up, we've got the
CareFeedViewController


119
00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:49.623 line:-1 position:50%
and InsightsViewController,


120
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:53.093 line:-1 position:50%
where we’ll be building out
the UI for our app.


121
00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:56.096 line:-1 position:50%
Now, if you run the starter app,


122
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,465 line:-1
you’ll see that there’s actually
not much there right now.


123
00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.433 line:-1 position:50%
It's just the
OCKDailyPageViewController


124
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,369 line:-1
with no content.


125
00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:04.971 line:-1 position:50%
It allows us to jump around
between days,


126
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,940 line:-1
but there’s nothing there yet.


127
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.343 line:-1 position:50%
It’ll be our job
to fill all of that in.


128
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,979 position:50%
There’s also the Insights tab
down here in the corner,


129
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,551 position:50%
and we'll be returning to that
during part three.


130
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:21,021 line:-1
Now, what we want to do is make
a consent card show up here


131
00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:22.856 line:-1 position:50%
in the participant’s feed.


132
00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:26.560 line:-1 position:50%
That consent task will gate
access to the rest of the app.


133
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.496 line:-1 position:50%
Nothing else will show up
until it’s been completed,


134
00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.830 line:-1 position:50%
and once it has been,


135
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,833 line:-1
all the other tasks
should appear.


136
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,005 line:-1
Jumping over here
to AppDelegate.swift,


137
00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.808 line:-1 position:50%
our first step will be
to persist a CareKit task


138
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,443 line:-1
for onboarding.


139
00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:47.314 line:-1 position:50%
Now, whenever we create a task,
we need to define a schedule


140
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,916 line:-1
that specifies how often
the task will appear


141
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,052 line:-1
in the participant’s feed.


142
00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:54.888 line:-1 position:50%
For onboarding,
we’ll use a daily schedule


143
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,090 line:-1
so they’ll be prompted
to onboard every day


144
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.359 line:-1 position:50%
until they finish consenting.


145
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,328 position:50%
Next, we’ll create a task.


146
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,629 position:50%
We give it an ID,


147
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,165 position:50%
which can be anything we want,
so long as it’s unique.


148
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,801 line:-1
Random identifiers are fine,
but in this case,


149
00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.903 line:-1 position:50%
I’ve just got a constant
we’ve defined over here


150
00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:12.038 line:-1 position:50%
in another file.


151
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,807 line:-1
We also need to pass in
the schedule


152
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,675 line:-1
that we just created.


153
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,278 line:-1
We’ll also specify
some instructions


154
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:22,515 line:-1
and indicate that onboarding
should not impact adherence.


155
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,285 line:-1
What this means is basically
that onboarding won’t count


156
00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:26.620 line:-1 position:50%
toward filling
the completion rings


157
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,456 line:-1
that you see at the top
of most CareKit apps.


158
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,626 position:50%
And finally, we can persist
the task into our store.


159
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,761 position:50%
We’ll just go ahead
and print out a message


160
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,497 line:-1
to let us know
if it was successful or not.


161
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,634 line:0
All right, we’ve got our
onboarding task in the store,


162
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,136 position:50%
ready to go,
and now, we’re ready


163
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,672 line:0
to make it appear
in the participant’s feed.


164
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,141 line:-1
We’ll hop over
CareViewController.swift


165
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.845 line:-1 position:50%
where we’ll tell CareKit
how we want it to be displayed.


166
00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:55.649 line:-1 position:50%
Here, we’re subclassing
OCKDailyPageViewController,


167
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,986 line:-1
which is the calendar and feed
that we saw just a moment ago.


168
00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:02.989 line:-1 position:50%
We’re overriding
the prepare listViewController


169
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,557 line:-1
for date method.


170
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,026 line:-1
This method will be invoked


171
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,962 line:-1
each time the user swipes
to a new date,


172
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,498 line:-1
and it’s our job
to inspect the date,


173
00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:14.234 line:-1 position:50%
determine what we want to show
on that date,


174
00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:15.869 line:-1 position:50%
and append
the appropriate content


175
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,371 line:-1
into the listViewController.


176
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,540 line:-1
Now, the first thing
we want to do


177
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,343 line:-1
is check if the participant
has finished onboarding or not,


178
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,978 line:-1
since we’ll display
different content


179
00:07:24.978 --> 00:07:27.080 line:-1 position:50%
based on the answer
to that question.


180
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,016 line:0
Let’s drop down a bit further
and write out a method


181
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,385 position:50%
to do just that.


182
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,453 line:0
Inside of our


183
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,222 position:50%
checkIfOnboardingIsComplete
method,


184
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:40,460 position:50%
we’ll create an OCKOutomeQuery,
and we’ll query for all outcomes


185
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,229 position:50%
associated
with the onboarding task.


186
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,864 line:0
When our query returns,


187
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,867 line:0
we’ll check to see if
any outcomes were found or not.


188
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,671 line:0
If there aren’t any, that means
onboarding hasn’t finished yet.


189
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,039 line:0
If there is one,


190
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,343 position:50%
that means that onboarding
is already complete.


191
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,411 position:50%
We’ll use our new method
right up here,


192
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,414 line:0
and based on whether or not
onboarding is complete,


193
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,850 line:0
we’ll either show
just the consent task


194
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,252 position:50%
or all the other tasks.


195
00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:08.722 line:-1 position:50%
All right. So far, so good!


196
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,724 line:-1
We now have
a mechanism in place


197
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,892 line:-1
for requiring the participant
to onboard


198
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,862 line:-1
before letting them
into the rest of the app.


199
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:20,166 line:-1
The next step is to set up
that onboarding flow.


200
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,236 line:-1
Right here, we want to create
a CareKit task card


201
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,572 line:-1
that presents
a ResearchKit survey,


202
00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:27.173 line:-1 position:50%
but before we can do that,


203
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,843 line:-1
we need to actually create
a ResearchKit survey


204
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,878 line:-1
so that we have something
to display.


205
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:36,750 line:-1
We’ll pop over to Surveys.swift
and get that taken care of.


206
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.452 line:-1 position:50%
Let’s stub out our function
to start.


207
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,922 position:50%
Our onboarding survey is going
to consist of five steps:


208
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,625 position:50%
a welcome step,
an instruction step,


209
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,395 position:50%
a signature step,
a permissions step,


210
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,264 line:0
and finally, a completion step.


211
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,700 line:-1
The first is going to be
the welcome step,


212
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.103 line:-1 position:50%
which will be
an ORKInstructionStep.


213
00:08:57.103 --> 00:09:00.206 line:-1 position:50%
We’re going to see a lot of
these instructions steps today.


214
00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.642 line:-1 position:50%
Whenever we create
a ResearchKit step,


215
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,778 line:-1
we need to give it
a unique identifier.


216
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,713 line:-1
You can use any pattern
that you’d like,


217
00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.648 line:-1 position:50%
including random identifiers.


218
00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:11.017 line:-1 position:50%
I’ve found that this
key path-inspired approach


219
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,186 line:-1
works really well for me.


220
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:16,489 line:-1
We’ll also specify a title
and some detailText


221
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,359 line:-1
as well as a header image.


222
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,493 position:50%
All right.


223
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:24,063 line:0
So up next: step two is going
to be our informed consent step,


224
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,133 position:50%
and this will also be
an instruction step.


225
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,003 line:0
But this time, we’re going
to add some body items.


226
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,338 position:50%
Body items are basically
bullet points,


227
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,374 position:50%
but we have the option
to use an image --


228
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,543 position:50%
and in this case,
an SF Symbol --


229
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,945 position:50%
in place of the bullet.


230
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,080 line:0
This body item
tells participants


231
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,150 position:50%
they’re going to be asked
to share some health data.


232
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,186 position:50%
Let’s create a second body item
to tell them


233
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,888 position:50%
they’ll be asked
to complete tasks


234
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,524 line:0
and a third to inform them


235
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,360 position:50%
they’ll be asked
to provide their signature.


236
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,262 line:0
Let's add one more
to remind them


237
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,799 position:50%
that their data will be kept
private and secure.


238
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,068 position:50%
Finally, we’ll insert
these body items


239
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,938 line:0
into our instruction step.


240
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,173 position:50%
And that covers
the instructions.


241
00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:10.343 line:-1 position:50%
Next up is gathering
a signature, and fortunately,


242
00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:13.780 line:-1 position:50%
ResearchKit makes this part
really easy.


243
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,650 line:0
The signature can be collected
with an ORKWebViewStep.


244
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,454 line:0
Setting the showSignature
AfterContent property to true


245
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,656 position:50%
prompts ResearchKit
to show the signature box


246
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,658 position:50%
at the bottom of the step.


247
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,329 position:50%
We can supply the actual consent
document as HTML,


248
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:33,032 position:50%
and it will be shown right above
the signature box.


249
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,202 line:0
There we go; the signature
was pretty quick and easy!


250
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,572 position:50%
The last bit will be
requesting permissions.


251
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,207 position:50%
For this fourth step,


252
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,010 line:0
we’ll collect permissions with
the HealthKitPermissionType


253
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,615 position:50%
that my teammate Pariece
introduced at WWDC last year.


254
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:52,585 position:50%
It requires that we specify
two sets of HealthKit types:


255
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,921 line:0
one that’s we’d like permission
to write to


256
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,191 line:0
and one that we’d like
permission to read from.


257
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:01,694 position:50%
This year, we’re introducing
two new permission types.


258
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,131 position:50%
The first is
ORKNotificationPermissionType,


259
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,935 position:50%
and it allows us to request
permission to show alerts,


260
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:12,171 position:50%
badge the app, and play sounds.


261
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,706 line:0
We’re also introducing


262
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,676 line:0
the ORKMotionActivity
PermissionType,


263
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:21,347 position:50%
which will help us ask for
access to device motion data.


264
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,552 position:50%
We’ll pass all three of these
into a requestPermissionStep,


265
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,421 line:0
which wraps up our fourth step.


266
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,624 position:50%
The fifth and final step is just
going to be a completion step


267
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,595 position:50%
that thanks the participant
for joining Jamie’s study.


268
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,797 position:50%
All of these steps will be
chained together


269
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,400 line:0
inside of an ORKOrderedTask.


270
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,035 line:0
We’ll pass in the steps
in the order


271
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,103 line:0
we’d like ResearchKit
to present them


272
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:48,241 position:50%
and then return the task
from this method.


273
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,475 line:-1
All right.


274
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,946 line:-1
Now that we’ve defined the whole
onboarding and consent flow,


275
00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:55.481 line:-1 position:50%
let’s jump back into
CareFeedViewController


276
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,052 line:-1
and revisit how to display it
from our CareKit-based app.


277
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,521 line:-1
We’re introducing
a brand-new class,


278
00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:04.257 line:-1 position:50%
the OCKSurveyTaskViewController,


279
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:07,460 line:-1
and it is specifically built
for this purpose.


280
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.063 line:-1 position:50%
Like all other
CareKit view controllers,


281
00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.999 line:-1 position:50%
we pass in the ID of the task
we’d like to display


282
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,069 line:-1
along with an eventQuery
and the storeManager.


283
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,672 line:-1
Additionally, we’ll also need
the survey we just created


284
00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:22.508 line:-1 position:50%
and a closure that translates
a ResearchKit result


285
00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:25.278 line:-1 position:50%
into an array
of CareKit outcome values.


286
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,849 line:-1
We’ll revisit this closure
in more detail during part two.


287
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:33,519 line:-1
For now, we’ll just say it's
sufficient to persist the date


288
00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:36.389 line:-1 position:50%
that the participant
completed onboarding.


289
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:40.860 line:-1 position:50%
We’ll also want to append
this task card into our feed.


290
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,730 line:-1
Now, there is actually
one more step,


291
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.165 line:-1 position:50%
and that is to make sure
that the feed reloads


292
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:49,636 line:-1
once the participant
finishes onboarding.


293
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,505 line:0
One way we can accomplish that
is by setting ourselves


294
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,274 position:50%
as the survey task view
controller’s delegate.


295
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,611 line:0
Then, down here, we can
implement the delegate method,


296
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,649 line:0
survey task view controller
didFinish task with result.


297
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,117 position:50%
In the body of this method,


298
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,353 line:0
we can check that onboarding
was completed successfully,


299
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,821 position:50%
which is basically just to say


300
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,591 line:0
that the participant didn’t
cancel out partway through;


301
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,595 position:50%
they went all the way to the end
and completed it successfully.


302
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:20,366 position:50%
If that’s the case, we can call
reload() to refresh the feed.


303
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,770 line:-1
All right, so our
onboarding card is set up.


304
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,538 line:-1
When the participant
completes onboarding,


305
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,676 line:-1
we’ll save an OCKOutcome
and then reload the feed.


306
00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:31.310 line:-1 position:50%
This is looking good!


307
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,780 line:-1
I think that’s --
that's everything, actually!


308
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,716 line:-1
Let’s run our app and confirm
that this all works.


309
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:43,423 line:-1
You can see that we’re
being asked to consent


310
00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:45.391 line:-1 position:50%
before we can begin
using the app.


311
00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:47.527 line:-1 position:50%
And that’s exactly what we want!


312
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,797 line:0
Let’s tap
on the Begin button here,


313
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,799 line:0
and we'll see that we’re greeted
by the welcome step


314
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,501 position:50%
we created just a moment ago.


315
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,804 line:0
The next step
is our instruction step


316
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,540 position:50%
with the body items
that we defined.


317
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,477 line:0
The SF Symbols that we chose
really bring it to life.


318
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,978 line:0
Next up is the signature step,


319
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:11,317 position:50%
so l’ll just scroll down here
and sign that...


320
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:15,221 line:0
...and then we move on
to the authorization step.


321
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:17.090 line:-1 position:50%
First, we'll authorize
HealthKit.


322
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,459 line:-1
Just go ahead and allow that.


323
00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:24.530 line:-1 position:50%
Next up is notifications,
and then device motion.


324
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.499 line:-1 position:50%
The last page
is our completion step


325
00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:28.267 line:-1 position:50%
that lets us know
we’re all done


326
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:32,505 line:-1
and thanks us for participating.


327
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,474 line:-1
And now we’re back
in our Care Feed.


328
00:14:34.474 --> 00:14:36.042 line:-1 position:50%
Note that we don’t see
the prompt


329
00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.710 line:-1 position:50%
to complete consent anymore


330
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,345 line:-1
because we’re done
with that now.


331
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,048 line:-1
Instead, this is where all
of the true content of our app


332
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,550 line:-1
is going to appear.


333
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.120 line:-1 position:50%
We’re going to get to that
in our next session.


334
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,557 line:-1
Hey Siri, can you message Jamie


335
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,893 line:-1
and tell him that we’re done
with the onboarding and consent?
