[Roy] Hi, my name is Roy.


5
00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.447 line:-2 align:center
I'm an engineer
on the Camera Software team.


6
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,516 line:-2
Today I will be walking you
through some exciting


7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,783 line:-1
photo quality improvements


8
00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.620 line:-2 align:center
we made with our most
popular video formats,


9
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.755 line:-2 align:center
and how your applications
can make use of them


10
00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.124 line:-2 align:center
to deliver
an even better experience.


11
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,760 line:-2
iPhone is the most popular
camera in the world,


12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,595 line:-2
and for many years,
developers have been


13
00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.431 line:-2 align:center
taking advantage of its
powerful camera systems


14
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.301 line:-2 align:center
to provide a diverse set
of world-class experiences,


15
00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:38.505 line:-2 align:center
from professional photography
apps to video streaming tools.


16
00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.474 line:-2 align:center
Different scenarios call for
different levels


17
00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:41.875 line:-1 align:center
of photo quality.


18
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.145 line:-2 align:center
For example, apps dedicated
to taking still photos


19
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,914 line:-2
will demand
the absolute best quality


20
00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.582 line:-1 align:center
that the cameras can provide.


21
00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.184 line:-1 align:center
A social app, on the other hand,


22
00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:52.019 line:-2 align:center
might need to apply face effect
overlays


23
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,721 line:-2
on top of the video
frames being streamed.


24
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,225 line:-2
And this custom rendering might
be computationally expensive.


25
00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.726 line:-1 align:center
In order to avoid frame drops,


26
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,196 line:-2
the developer might
prefer lower resolution frames


27
00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:05.132 line:-2 align:center
so there are fewer pixels
to process per frame.


28
00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:08.402 line:-2 align:center
This diversity in use cases
calls for an easy way


29
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,204 line:-2
to specify where you want
to land


30
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:13,040 line:-2
on the scale of quality
versus performance.


31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,409 line:-2
Before we dive into photo
quality, however,


32
00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.844 line:-1 align:center
let's have a brief refresher


33
00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:19.513 line:-2 align:center
on how photos are taken
on iOS in general.


34
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:22,549 line:-2
We will start
with an AVCaptureSession object,


35
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,085 line:-2
around which we can build
our object graph.


36
00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.454 line:-2 align:center
Since we are taking photos,
we will use a camera


37
00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:29.623 line:-1 align:center
as our AVCaptureDevice.


38
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.327 line:-2 align:center
Then, an AVCaptureDeviceInput
is instantiated


39
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.728 line:-1 align:center
based on that device,


40
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,130 line:-2
and it will provide input data
to the session.


41
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,101 line:-2
An AVCapturePhotoOutput
will then be added to the graph


42
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.736 line:-1 align:center
as the recipients of the photos.


43
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,573 line:0
And all these elements
are then connected together


44
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,343 line:0
using an AVCaptureConnection.


45
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,979 align:center
After the session
started running,


46
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,848 line:-2
we can capture photos by calling
the capturePhoto method


47
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,718 line:-2
on the AVCapturePhotoOutput
instance.


48
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,453 line:-2
Further customization
can be done


49
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,955 line:-2
using the AVCapturePhotoSettings
object


50
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,525 line:-2
passed to the capturePhoto
method.


51
00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.593 line:-2 align:center
The captured photo will be
represented


52
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,662 line:-1
as an AVCapturePhoto object


53
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,431 line:-2
that you will receive
in your delegate method.


54
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,401 align:center
We had a very detailed
discussion on these APIs


55
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:18,639 line:0
in the 2016 session,
Advances in iOS Photography.


56
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,108 line:0
Please check it out if
you haven't already.


57
00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:24.511 line:-2 align:center
Now that we know how to take
photos on iOS in general,


58
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.247 line:-2 align:center
let's see how high quality
photos can be taken.


59
00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.750 line:-2 align:center
Historically,
if you wanted to capture photos


60
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.085 line:-2 align:center
of the best possible quality,
you would set the


61
00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.922 line:-2 align:center
isAutoStillImageStabilization
Enabled property


62
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,424 line:-2
on your
AVCapturePhotoSettings to true,


63
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,294 line:-2
and that's because still
image stabilization


64
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,663 line:-2
was the main method for getting
higher quality photos.


65
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,365 line:-2
But over the years,
we have been continuously


66
00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.235 line:-2 align:center
evolving our photo
quality-enhancing algorithms.


67
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,571 line:-2
In addition to still
image stabilization,


68
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,607 line:-2
we now have a far richer set
of techniques to draw from,


69
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,677 line:-2
such as a variety of multi-image
fusion technologies,


70
00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:59.313 line:-2 align:center
including
Smart HDR and Deep Fusion.


71
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,148 line:-1
Consequently, the name


72
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,584 line:-2
isAutoStillImageStabilization
Enabled


73
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:07,387 line:-2
has become quite obsolete as
a proxy for high photo quality.


74
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,024 line:-2
To solve this problem,
in iOS 13, we introduced


75
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,127 line:-2
AVCapturePhotoOutput.QualityPrio
ritization.


76
00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.697 line:-2 align:center
It's a very easy way
to tell AVCapturePhotoOutput


77
00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:20.400 line:-2 align:center
how to prioritize quality
in your photo captures.


78
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.237 line:-2 align:center
We haven't had a chance
to talk about this important API


79
00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:25.572 line:-1 align:center
at previous WWDCs,


80
00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.841 line:-2 align:center
so let's now take a moment
to see how it works.


81
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,744 line:-2
There are three quality
prioritization levels


82
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,145 line:-1
to choose from:


83
00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:34.381 line:-1 align:center
speed, balanced, and quality.


84
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.350 line:-2 align:center
With speed,
you are telling the framework


85
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,653 line:-2
that the speed of the capture is
what you care about the most,


86
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,322 line:-2
even at the expense
of photo quality.


87
00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.291 line:-2 align:center
If a balance needs
to be struck between


88
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,426 line:-2
photo quality
and delivery speed,


89
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,362 line:-1
balanced should be used.


90
00:03:48.362 --> 00:03:50.597 line:-2 align:center
Quality does the opposite
of speed.


91
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,900 line:-2
It says image quality
should be prioritized


92
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,301 line:-1
first and foremost,


93
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,603 line:-2
while the potential
slowness of the capture process


94
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,572 line:-1
can be tolerated.


95
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,642 line:-2
Please note that the quality
prioritization specified


96
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,811 line:-2
only serves as a hint
to the AVCapturePhotoOutput,


97
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,548 line:-2
and it doesn't dictate
what algorithms to use.


98
00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.517 line:-2 align:center
Ultimately,
the AVCapturePhotoOutput


99
00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:12.486 line:-2 align:center
will consider a variety
of constraints


100
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:16,323 line:-2
and choose the most appropriate
algorithm for the current scene.


101
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,792 line:-2
For instance, it might choose
a different method


102
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,428 line:-2
for a low-light situation
than in a well-lit space.


103
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,431 line:-2
That being said,
we understand that


104
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.200 line:-2 align:center
based on different capture
durations,


105
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.769 line:-2 align:center
you might want to plan your
user experience differently.


106
00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:32.039 line:-2 align:center
So on the
AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings


107
00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.342 line:-2 align:center
object passed to some of
the AVCapturePhotoOutputDelegate


108
00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:37.477 line:-2 align:center
methods, we give you
a property called


109
00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:40.380 line:-2 align:center
photoProcessingTimeRange
that indicates how long


110
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,983 line:-2
it will take to deliver
the photo to your delegate.


111
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:46.486 line:-2 align:center
This, for instance,
can help you decide whether


112
00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:49.223 line:-2 align:center
you want to put out a spinner if
the capture will take a while.


113
00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:51.225 line:-1 align:center
Let's see how it works in code.


114
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,894 line:-2
When you are setting up your
AVCapturePhotoOutput,


115
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,763 line:-2
you can specify a max
quality prioritization


116
00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:59.166 line:-2 align:center
that the particular capture
session will require.


117
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,636 line:-2
If you choose not to do so,
the default value is balanced.


118
00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.705 line:-1 align:center
This only has to be set once.


119
00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:07.474 line:-2 align:center
The importance of doing so
is that depending on


120
00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.243 line:-2 align:center
different settings,
we will configure


121
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,211 line:-2
our capture
pipelines differently.


122
00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:13.347 line:-2 align:center
For instance,
if we know you will not go


123
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,148 line:-1
beyond speed prioritization,


124
00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.950 line:-2 align:center
we can construct
a capture pipeline


125
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.086 line:-2 align:center
that consumes
much less memory and power


126
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,889 line:-2
than the one for, say,
balanced prioritization.


127
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,124 line:-2
So we encourage you
to choose responsibly


128
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,592 line:-1
and only take what you need.


129
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,228 line:-2
Before you
call the capturePhoto method,


130
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,564 line:-2
you can customize
the quality prioritization


131
00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:31.932 line:-1 align:center
for this particular capture


132
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,268 line:-2
by setting the
photoQualityPrioritization


133
00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:37.437 line:-2 align:center
property on your
AVCapturePhotoSettings object.


134
00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:39.273 line:-1 align:center
The default value is balanced.


135
00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:41.775 line:-2 align:center
As demonstrated here,
we are using


136
00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:43.844 line:-2 align:center
two different levels
in two different situations.


137
00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:48.015 line:-2 align:center
Please note that the per-capture
quality prioritization


138
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,317 line:-2
cannot go beyond your
AVCapturePhotoOutput's


139
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,586 line:-1
max quality prioritization,


140
00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:54.521 line:-2 align:center
otherwise
you will get an exception.


141
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,624 line:-2
The performance characteristics
of the three levels


142
00:05:57.624 --> 00:06:00.127 line:-2 align:center
are determined by the underlying
algorithms we use.


143
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.463 line:-2 align:center
The mappings differ based
on the kinds of format you use,


144
00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:05.199 line:-2 align:center
and we will talk some
more on the difference


145
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,235 line:-2
between photo and video
formats momentarily.


146
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:11,638 line:-2
With photo formats, Speed
will get you WYSIWYG photos--


147
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:14,174 line:-2
that is What You See is
What You Get photos--


148
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,676 line:-1
which are lightly processed


149
00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:18.445 line:-2 align:center
only with some noise reduction
applied.


150
00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:21.548 line:-2 align:center
If Balanced is specified,
we will choose from a collection


151
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,184 line:-2
of fast fusion algorithms
that produce much better


152
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,220 line:-2
photo quality
than WYSIWYG photos


153
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.288 line:-2 align:center
at a somewhat slower
capture rate.


154
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,691 align:center
For Quality, depending
on the current device


155
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,893 line:0
and lux level,
the framework will use


156
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,395 align:center
some heavy machineries
such as Deep Fusion


157
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,198 line:0
in order to provide the best
possible photo quality.


158
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,900 line:-1
The photos will look great,


159
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,134 line:-1
but there is no free lunch.


160
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,836 line:-2
You pay
for it by using more time.


161
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,372 align:center
For video formats,
on the other hand,


162
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,574 line:0
all levels will use
the lightest processing


163
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,010 line:0
to deliver photos
as fast as possible.


164
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,312 line:-2
We have been talking
about photo and video formats


165
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,313 line:-1
for a while now.


166
00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:54.381 line:-1 align:center
Let's take a closer look


167
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.483 line:-1 align:center
at the differences between them.


168
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,486 line:-2
By using photo formats, you are
signaling to the framework


169
00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:02.089 line:-2 align:center
that taking still photos is what
you care about the most.


170
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:06,326 line:-2
For example, if you are using
an AVCaptureVideoDataOutput


171
00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:07.561 line:-1 align:center
with a photo format,


172
00:07:07.561 --> 00:07:09.463 line:-2 align:center
the sample buffers you get
by default


173
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:12,099 line:-2
will only be
of preview resolutions,


174
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,434 line:-2
and that's because knowing
that taking photos


175
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,204 line:-2
is your top priority,
we can assume that these frames


176
00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:20.507 line:-2 align:center
will be used for preview
rather than video recordings.


177
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,010 line:-2
A good reason to choose photo
formats is that


178
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.346 line:-2 align:center
some photo-centric features
are exclusive for photo formats,


179
00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:30.017 line:-2 align:center
such as Live Photo and ProRAW,
et cetera.


180
00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:31.618 line:-2 align:center
If that's
something you want to do,


181
00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.121 line:-2 align:center
then photo format
is the way to go.


182
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:37.257 line:-2 align:center
Photo formats come with the
highest resolutions available,


183
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,760 line:-2
but the frame rates are limited
to 30 frames per second.


184
00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:43.096 line:-2 align:center
To choose photo formats,
you can set


185
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,765 line:-1
your session preset to photo.


186
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,567 line:-1
Or you can pick a format where


187
00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:49.770 line:-2 align:center
isHighestPhotoQualitySupported
is true.


188
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.172 line:-2 align:center
The usage of video formats,
on the other hand,


189
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,442 line:-2
indicates that the experiences
will now center around videos.


190
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,544 line:-2
You will get resolutions
more suitable


191
00:07:57.544 --> 00:07:59.847 line:-2 align:center
for recording and streaming,
and you will be able


192
00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:02.916 line:-2 align:center
to use high frame
rates such as 60 fps.


193
00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:05.118 line:-2 align:center
If a format
is not a photo format,


194
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,254 line:-2
then it's
considered a video format.


195
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:10,257 line:-2
So you can select one by using
a non-photo session preset


196
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:11,625 line:-1
or choosing a format where


197
00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:14.261 line:-2 align:center
isHighestPhotoQualitySupported
is false.


198
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.363 line:-2 align:center
You might be wondering
why we are not applying


199
00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:19.233 line:-2 align:center
some of the powerful
algorithms to video formats.


200
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,667 line:-1
It's not because we're lazy.


201
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.603 line:-1 align:center
We have good reasons for that.


202
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:25,639 line:-2
Many apps choose to use video
formats because they need to do


203
00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:27.875 line:-1 align:center
heavy custom processing,


204
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,477 line:-2
and video formats are
well-suited for this purpose


205
00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:32.713 line:-1 align:center
because of their low overhead.


206
00:08:32.713 --> 00:08:34.615 line:-2 align:center
If we leverage some
of the aforementioned


207
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,149 line:-1
photo enhancing techniques,


208
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,853 line:-2
we might introduce degradations
in these apps' experiences.


209
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,523 line:-2
For instance,
an AR app might allow users


210
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,026 line:-2
to snap a photo of the 3D scene
that they are interacting with.


211
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.562 line:-2 align:center
Running the existing
fusion algorithms at this point


212
00:08:48.562 --> 00:08:50.664 line:-2 align:center
is likely
to introduce frame drops


213
00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:52.466 line:-1 align:center
in the app's camera feed,


214
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,601 line:-1
interrupting its core feature.


215
00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:57.871 line:-2 align:center
So we have been very conscious
of this delicate balance between


216
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.974 line:-2 align:center
quality and speed, and we
designed our video formats


217
00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:05.045 line:-2 align:center
to work responsively even under
the most demanding conditions.


218
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:08.715 line:-2 align:center
But those compromises
stop today with iOS 15.


219
00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:11.084 line:-2 align:center
We are taking a major
leap in photo quality


220
00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:13.320 line:-2 align:center
with our most popular
video formats.


221
00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:16.823 line:-2 align:center
With some improved algorithms,
we are now able to radically


222
00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:19.927 line:-2 align:center
improve photo quality
without impacting other aspects


223
00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:21.662 line:-1 align:center
of your apps' experiences.


224
00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:25.032 line:-2 align:center
With this new feature, your apps
can now take amazing photos,


225
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,733 line:-2
while retaining
the same flexibility


226
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,603 line:-2
to perform sophisticated
custom computation.


227
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:34,174 line:-2
So how big of a quality leap are
we talking about here?


228
00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:36.543 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a look at some
before-and-after comparisons.


229
00:09:39.313 --> 00:09:41.815 line:-2 align:center
The improvement is quite
substantial.


230
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,283 line:-2
The little boy's face
on the right


231
00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:44.718 line:-1 align:center
has much less noise,


232
00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:46.486 line:-2 align:center
and thus
looks much more natural.


233
00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:49.289 line:-2 align:center
And we can better perceive
the light coming off his hair.


234
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,561 line:-2
The catch lights
in your subjects' eyes


235
00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:56.363 line:-2 align:center
are simply
more vibrant and lively.


236
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,602 line:-2
In this outdoor low-light
situation,


237
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:05,906 line:-2
there is superior de-noising
on her face and clothes.


238
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,408 line:-2
Lastly, the environment
also looks better.


239
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,144 line:-2
The leather texture on the chair
is much better preserved.


240
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,315 line:-2
Now that you're enticed,
let's take a look


241
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:18,151 line:-2
at the algorithm mappings
for the supported video formats.


242
00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.922 line:-2 align:center
Speed will still get you
the lightly processed


243
00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:23.290 line:-1 align:center
WYSIWYG photos.


244
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,792 line:-2
They are still the fastest
way of getting a photo,


245
00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.262 line:-2 align:center
and since speed is now
your top priority,


246
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:30,797 line:-2
this fits the bill perfectly,
so we didn't change it.


247
00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:32.733 line:-2 align:center
You will not be getting
any frame drops


248
00:10:32.733 --> 00:10:34.201 line:-1 align:center
in your video recordings


249
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:37.070 line:-2 align:center
or any disruptions
in your preview feed.


250
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.206 line:-2 align:center
With Balanced, however,
you are now getting


251
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,642 line:-2
a significant bump in quality,
while only getting


252
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,244 line:-2
a very slight increase
in the photo's processing time.


253
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,447 line:-2
And just like in Speed,
your video recording


254
00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:49.216 line:-1 align:center
will not have any frame drops.


255
00:10:49.216 --> 00:10:51.285 line:-2 align:center
Your preview feed will not
get interrupted,


256
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,719 line:-2
even when
those great-looking photos


257
00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:54.454 line:-1 align:center
are taken and processed.


258
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,756 align:center
Finally, for Quality,


259
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,658 align:center
we are running more
expensive algorithms


260
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,693 align:center
to get even better qualities.


261
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,696 align:center
This might drop frames or cause
preview feed interruptions,


262
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,998 line:-2
depending on how recent
your devices are.


263
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,601 line:-2
This feature will be
available on all iPhones


264
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:10,204 line:-2
with support all the way
back to iPhone XS.


265
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,773 line:-2
The video formats
that are getting this upgrade


266
00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:14.908 line:-2 align:center
are the most
popular ones:


267
00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:16.410 line:-1 align:center
1280x720


268
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.079 line:-2 align:center
with support for both 30
and 60 frames per second.


269
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,851 line:-2
1920x1080,
also for both 30 and 60 fps.


270
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:28,622 align:center
1920x1440, for 30 fps.


271
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,291 align:center
And we even added support
for 4K, with 30 fps.


272
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,394 line:-2
So how can you make sure
you are using


273
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,829 line:-1
the right formats in your code?


274
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,431 line:-1
It's very simple.


275
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:40,467 line:-2
In iOS 15, we are introducing
a new property called


276
00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:42.336 line:-1 align:center
isHighPhotoQualitySupported


277
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,872 line:-2
on the AVCaptureDevice.Format
type.


278
00:11:44.872 --> 00:11:46.773 line:-2 align:center
For formats
that support this feature,


279
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,642 line:-1
this property will be true.


280
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,777 line:-2
Any format with this
property being true


281
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,146 line:-2
is guaranteed to be a video
format,


282
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,381 line:-1
so you don't have to worry


283
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,316 line:-2
about accidentally
picking a photo format.


284
00:11:57.751 --> 00:12:00.454 line:-2 align:center
Let's say you want
to get any such format.


285
00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:02.556 line:-2 align:center
You just need to get
the formats available


286
00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:04.691 line:-2 align:center
on your
AVCaptureDevice instance.


287
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:05.893 line:-1 align:center
Then just select the one


288
00:12:05.893 --> 00:12:09.096 line:-2 align:center
with isHighPhotoQualitySupported
being true.


289
00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:12.900 line:-2 align:center
We updated our sample code AVCam
to use this feature.


290
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.103 line:-2 align:center
Please check it out if you want
to see a working example.


291
00:12:16.103 --> 00:12:18.639 line:-2 align:center
It's possible to confuse
the new property


292
00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:20.541 line:-1 align:center
isHighPhotoQualitySupported


293
00:12:20.541 --> 00:12:24.077 line:-2 align:center
with the existing
isHighestPhotoQualitySupported.


294
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.580 line:-2 align:center
Like we mentioned earlier,
the latter tells you


295
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.982 line:-2 align:center
whether a format
is a photo format,


296
00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:30.884 line:-2 align:center
and it doesn't tell you
whether a video format


297
00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:32.953 line:-1 align:center
supports high photo quality.


298
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,122 line:-2
Now, do you need to put
in any work at all


299
00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:36.590 line:-1 align:center
to get this new feature?


300
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,125 line:-1
The answer is maybe.


301
00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:40.594 line:-2 align:center
If you are already using
AVCapturePhotoOutput,


302
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,596 line:-2
and the .balanced
prioritization,


303
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,598 line:-2
then congratulations,
you will automatically


304
00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:47.034 line:-2 align:center
get better-looking photos
on iOS 15.


305
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,771 line:-2
If your app is using
speed prioritization,


306
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,806 line:-2
by simply updating it
to balanced,


307
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,308 line:-1
you will receive better photos


308
00:12:54.308 --> 00:12:56.376 line:-2 align:center
without having to worry
about any frame drops.


309
00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:59.146 line:-2 align:center
If you're
still using the deprecated


310
00:12:59.146 --> 00:13:01.448 line:-1 align:center
AVCaptureStillImageOutput,


311
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,816 line:-2
then hopefully this
will give you


312
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,685 line:-1
a big incentive to switch over.


313
00:13:05.385 --> 00:13:07.721 line:-2 align:center
Since now using
the quality prioritization


314
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,090 line:-2
might introduce
frame drops in your videos,


315
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.492 line:-2 align:center
we don't want to impose
that new behavior on your apps


316
00:13:12.492 --> 00:13:14.194 line:-1 align:center
without you opting in.


317
00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:16.396 line:-2 align:center
So we put in a link time
check to make sure that


318
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,966 line:-2
if your app is using
quality prioritization


319
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:23,036 line:-2
with a video format and was
compiled prior to iOS 15,


320
00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:25.939 line:-2 align:center
then we will automatically
change it to balanced.


321
00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:28.375 line:-2 align:center
If you indeed would like
to get the best quality,


322
00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:33.013 line:-2 align:center
all you need to do is re-compile
your app with the iOS 15 SDK.


323
00:13:33.013 --> 00:13:35.082 line:-2 align:center
There are a few caveats
to be aware of.


324
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.684 line:-2 align:center
This feature currently
only works


325
00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:39.152 line:-1 align:center
with AVCaptureSession,


326
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,388 line:-2
and not
with AVCaptureMultiCamSession.


327
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.826 line:-2 align:center
The deprecated
AVCaptureStillImageOutput


328
00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:48.095 line:-1 align:center
will not support this feature.


329
00:13:48.095 --> 00:13:51.331 line:-2 align:center
If you are using .balanced
or .quality prioritization,


330
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.966 line:-1 align:center
some of the algorithms we use


331
00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.569 line:-2 align:center
might fuse several
differently exposed images


332
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,371 line:-1
to improve dynamic range.


333
00:13:57.371 --> 00:13:59.173 line:-1 align:center
Photos will have great quality,


334
00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:00.774 line:-2 align:center
but they might look
different from video


335
00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:03.076 line:-1 align:center
being recorded at the same time.


336
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:06,180 line:-2
If you need your video and photo
to look exactly the same,


337
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.981 line:-1 align:center
please use .speed instead.


338
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,651 line:-2
Lastly, let's summarize
what we just covered.


339
00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:13.820 line:-2 align:center
When designing your app's
experience,


340
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.689 line:-2 align:center
be aware
of the decision to choose


341
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,091 line:-1
between quality and speed.


342
00:14:18.091 --> 00:14:20.460 line:-2 align:center
Once you figured out the role
photo quality will play


343
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,663 line:-2
in your use cases,
use the appropriate


344
00:14:22.663 --> 00:14:24.898 line:-2 align:center
prioritization levels
to accomplish that.


345
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,333 line:-2
And with a minimal amount
of work


346
00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:28.235 line:-2 align:center
and sometimes
no work at all,


347
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,705 line:-2
you will now be getting amazing
photos with video formats.


348
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,806 line:-1
Thank you very much.
