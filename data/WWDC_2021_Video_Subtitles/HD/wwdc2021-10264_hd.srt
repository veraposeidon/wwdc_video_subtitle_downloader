[Nicki]
Hi, I'm Nicki Brower.


3
00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.882 line:-2
I'm an engineer
on the Pencil and Paper team.


4
00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:17.584 line:-2
And today, I'm gonna show
you how to adopt Quick Note.


5
00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:22.689 line:-2
Quick Note is a brand-new,
system-wide note-taking experience


6
00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:27.828 line:-2
aimed to not only streamline the ability
to take notes on iOS and macOS,


7
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:32.332 line:-2
but to connect content from
multiple apps and the web in one location.


8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.271 line:-2
This feature enables people
to easily bring up a Note anywhere,


9
00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:41.808 line:-2
and the best part is, it uses an API
that already exists:


10
00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.044 line:-1
NSUserActivity.


11
00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:48.081 line:-2
If that sounds familiar, it's because it's
used for other features, like Handoff.


12
00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:52.786 line:-2
Today, I'll show you Quick Note
live and in action.


13
00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:55.122 line:-2
I'll talk about
the how it works on the system


14
00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:58.258 line:-1
and how to adopt NSUserActivity.


15
00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:02.930 line:-2
Finally, I'll go over some best practices
so you can create the best experience.


16
00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.700 line:-2
To show you the new Quick Note feature,
I'm going to step through


17
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.370 line:-2
my plan of action to get into
shape using Apple Fitness+.


18
00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:15.342 line:-2
I haven't signed up yet, and I don't
want to without an action plan.


19
00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.178 line:-2
Instead of having
to switch to the Notes app,


20
00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:23.250 line:-2
I'm now able to use my pencil to swipe up
from the bottom right corner of the screen


21
00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:27.754 line:-2
to create a brand-new Quick Note
to remember that when I'm ready to start,


22
00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:30.424 line:-2
the Apple website has all
the information I need to know.


23
00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:38.031 line:-2
There's also a new add link menu at
the top of the Quick Note,


24
00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:40.300 line:-2
where I'll add a link to the website
to make it easy


25
00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:41.869 line:-1
to navigate back to this content.


26
00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:47.808 line:-2
Similar to picture-in-picture,
the Quick Note window


27
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:51.578 line:-2
is able to freely move around
to any corner of the device.


28
00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:55.249 line:-2
I can also pinch to scale
the window from the default size,


29
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:58.252 line:-2
to the smallest size,
all the way up the largest size.


30
00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.088 line:-1
If I'm finished with my note,


31
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.957 line:-2
I can press the Done button
in top left corner.


32
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.260 line:-1
but I still have some stuff I need to add,


33
00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:09.763 line:-2
so I'll swipe the UI to the right
to tuck it away on the side of the screen.


34
00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:14.134 line:-2
In addition to websites,
of course, it also works with apps.


35
00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:18.805 line:-2
Using Maps, I was able to find
a great spot to practice my HIIT workouts.


36
00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.976 line:-2
I'll pull out my note that I tucked away
and add this location to my note, too.


37
00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:27.781 line:-2
For more room to draw, tap the Notes icon
from the Quick Note toolbar


38
00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.716 line:-1
to get to the note in the Notes app.


39
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:35.122 line:-2
Here, I'll take advantage of the ability
to draw over images and links.


40
00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:40.027 line:-2
The links I've added here
aren't just any old links.


41
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.797 line:-2
Sure, tapping on them will take
me to Safari or Maps,


42
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.766 line:-1
but now I can get back to my note


43
00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.936 line:-2
from these apps
with Quick Note Suggestions.


44
00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.606 line:-2
When I go to the site
about Apple Fitness+,


45
00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.543 line:-2
the Quick Note Suggestions UI will
show up in the bottom right-hand corner.


46
00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:59.279 line:-2
Tapping on this will bring
me right back to where I was,


47
00:02:59.313 --> 00:03:03.183 line:-2
and I'll add a note that my goal is
to do a HIIT workout 4 to 5 times a week.


48
00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:08.522 line:-1
I've created a note here on an iPad,


49
00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.757 line:-2
but it also works
cross-platform with the Mac.


50
00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:14.628 line:-2
When I visit
the link about Apple Fitness+,


51
00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:18.599 line:-2
the Quick Note Suggestions UI
will also appear here on my Mac.


52
00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:21.535 line:-2
When I click on it, I'll be
directed to the note in the Notes app.


53
00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:26.139 line:-2
Now that you've met Quick Note,
let's talk about how it works.


54
00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:29.109 line:-2
An NSUserActivity object
provides a way


55
00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:32.880 line:-2
to capture the state of an app
and put it to use later.


56
00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:36.383 line:-2
User activity objects are
created about what is happening,


57
00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:39.453 line:-2
such as viewing a web page
or viewing app content,


58
00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:42.756 line:-2
and each app will register
its current activity with the system.


59
00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.393 line:-1
The system then gets these activities


60
00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.595 line:-2
and sends them out
out to features like Handoff.


61
00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:52.733 line:-2
Quick Note linking
piggybacks on this system.


62
00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:57.137 line:-2
In addition to going to Handoff,
Spotlight, and Reminders,


63
00:03:57.171 --> 00:04:00.340 line:-2
registered activities are
also sent to Quick Note.


64
00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:03.410 line:-2
This is how the link shows
up in the add link menu


65
00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:05.612 line:-1
and what triggers Quick Note Suggestions.


66
00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:09.783 line:-2
NSUserActivity already has
three properties


67
00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:14.988 line:-2
that serve as durable identifiers
for linking app content with Quick Note.


68
00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:18.392 line:-2
To be part of this ecosystem,
you must set one or more


69
00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.327 line:-1
of these properties:


70
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.596 line:-1
targetContentIdentifier,


71
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:24.531 line:-1
persistentIdentifier,


72
00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:26.934 line:-1
and webpageURL.


73
00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:30.604 line:-2
Which ones you choose depends on what
other features you want to support.


74
00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:36.443 line:-2
targetContentIdentifier is also
used during state restoration.


75
00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:41.114 line:-2
This property creates a great multitasking
experience for apps that run on iPad.


76
00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:46.153 line:-2
persistentIdentifier is also used
to identify app content


77
00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:48.422 line:-1
in the system's Spotlight index,


78
00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:52.826 line:-2
and webpageURL is
also used for web fallback during Handoff.


79
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.129 line:-2
In order for Quick Note links to work,
there are a few properties


80
00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:58.866 line:-1
the identifiers need to have.


81
00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:02.302 line:-2
They should be unique
for that piece of content,


82
00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:05.772 line:-2
be global so they work across
all devices,


83
00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:10.177 line:-2
and be stable enough
to work for that content over time.


84
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.249 line:-2
Having a unique, global, and stable
identifier for an activity


85
00:05:15.282 --> 00:05:17.117 line:-1
enables Quick Note Suggestions.


86
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.687 line:-2
When I come back to the website
about Apple Fitness+,


87
00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:23.457 line:-2
the reason
the Quick Note Suggestions UI shows up


88
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.362 line:-2
is because the identifier in the link,
created an hour ago or six months ago,


89
00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:30.931 line:-2
still matches the identifier
on the website.


90
00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:35.836 line:-2
There are three main steps
to adopt NSUserActivity:


91
00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:40.107 line:-2
declare supported activities
in your app's Info.plist,


92
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.442 line:-1
create and register user activities


93
00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:46.146 line:-2
describing what's on screen
at different points in time,


94
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.316 line:-2
and handle incoming requests
to continue an activity.


95
00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:54.454 line:-2
This could be coming from a link
in Quick Note or from another device.


96
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.425 line:-2
Declare the activity types
that your app supports


97
00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:02.729 line:-2
under the NSUserActivityTypes
key in its Info.plist file.


98
00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:07.801 line:-2
The system uses the information
in that key to determine whether


99
00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:11.672 line:-2
your app is capable of handling
a given user activity object.


100
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.441 line:-1
To create an NSUserActivity object,


101
00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:19.146 line:-2
use one of your plist-registered
activity type strings, and set the title.


102
00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:23.016 line:-2
Set one or more of the three
identifiers mentioned earlier.


103
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.153 line:-2
Any one of these identifiers
can be used for Quick Note.


104
00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:29.756 line:-2
For this example,
let's say your app is an iPad app


105
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.093 line:-2
that is also interested
in supporting state restoration.


106
00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:35.729 line:-1
Set targetContentIdentifier.


107
00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:38.498 line:-2
Set the userInfo property
with any app-specific


108
00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:41.735 line:-2
state information
needed to continue the activity.


109
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.172 line:-1
Then, attach it to a responder.


110
00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:48.542 line:-1
Instead of having to register the activity


111
00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:51.845 line:-2
by manually managing
the current app activity,


112
00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.848 line:-1
let the system take care of it for you.


113
00:06:54.882 --> 00:06:57.718 line:-1
By setting the activity on a responder,


114
00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:01.421 line:-2
the object becomes managed
by UIKit and AppKit.


115
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.859 line:-1
Because NSUserActivity is cross-platform,


116
00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:09.196 line:-1
this code works on both iOS and macOS.


117
00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:13.367 line:-2
The final step is to handle
receiving incoming activities


118
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.702 line:-1
and restoring its state in your app.


119
00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:18.872 line:-2
When a link is tapped,
Quick Note launches your app


120
00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:23.010 line:-2
and calls the scene
(willContinueUserActivityWithType) method


121
00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:25.712 line:-1
of UIWindowSceneDelegate.


122
00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:29.349 line:-2
This is where you can give some feedback
that your app is receiving the activity.


123
00:07:31.018 --> 00:07:34.054 line:-2
Quick Note then provides
the activity to your app


124
00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:37.191 line:-1
in scene(continue userActivity:).


125
00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:40.761 line:-2
This is where you set up
any view controllers, views,


126
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:45.199 line:-2
and use the userInfo dictionary
to restore and continue the activity.


127
00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:48.902 line:-2
In the case of Handoff,
if devices can't connect,


128
00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:53.774 line:-2
the system calls scene
(didFailToContinueUserActivityWithType)


129
00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.443 line:-1
where you can present an error message.


130
00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.213 line:-2
This method will
not be invoked for Quick Note,


131
00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:03.250 line:-2
but is good to implement for a
well-rounded adoption of NSUserActivity.


132
00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:07.321 line:-2
For macOS apps,
implement the equivalent


133
00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:11.358 line:-2
application
(willContinueUserActivityWithType),


134
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:14.628 line:-1
application(continue userActivity),


135
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:18.699 line:-2
and application
(didFailToContinueUserActivityWithType)


136
00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:20.234 line:-1
in the app delegate.


137
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,470
For more information about
adopting NSUserActivity,


138
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:30,143
check out the WWDC 2014 video, "Adopting
Handoff on iOS 8 and OS X."


139
00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:37.117 line:-2
NSUserActivity is a gateway because it's
the foundation for many other features.


140
00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:42.923 line:-2
By adopting it for Quick Note, this
is everything else that you could get.


141
00:08:42.956 --> 00:08:47.261 line:-2
Handoff is on by default,
while the others are opt-in.


142
00:08:47.294 --> 00:08:49.363 line:-1
Your app could be even more powerful


143
00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:53.200 line:-2
because people could create a reminder
about a document in your app,


144
00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:56.136 line:-2
or have a blog post from
your app show up in spotlight,


145
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.272 line:-1
or improved multi-window handling.


146
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:03,777
Check out the latest
documentation and related WWDC videos


147
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,145
for more information.


148
00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:09.316 line:-2
Last, but certainly not least,
let's go over some


149
00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:13.587 line:-2
best practices for adopting
NSUserActivity for Quick Note.


150
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.023 line:-1
I'm going to go over four behaviors,


151
00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.559 line:-2
and for each of these,
I'll talk about why


152
00:09:18.592 --> 00:09:20.994 line:-2
and how
to implement them in your app.


153
00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:26.033 line:-2
The title property is a human-readable
string for the activity.


154
00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:30.737 line:-2
This is the string that shows
up in the add link menu.


155
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:33.340 line:-2
That said,
the title should provide a good,


156
00:09:33.373 --> 00:09:36.877 line:-2
descriptive representation
of the content.


157
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.848 line:-2
In general, it's better to use the title
of the document or item directly.


158
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:47.354 line:-2
There are a few tips to help
identifiers be unique, global, and stable.


159
00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:51.825 line:-1
Avoid using device-specific data.


160
00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:55.529 line:-2
If the identifier for this
photo is its local file path,


161
00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:59.666 line:-2
the link is only guaranteed
to work on the device it was created on.


162
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.504 line:-2
Avoid any transient information,
like a session ID


163
00:10:03.537 --> 00:10:06.206 line:-1
or specific viewing properties.


164
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.378 line:-2
The title of the photo might be implicitly
unique, but if it can be modified,


165
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:15.182 line:-2
there's no guarantee it will exist when
trying to navigate back to this content.


166
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:21.889 line:-2
Thinking long term, like using the app's
saved UUID for the photo,


167
00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:24.825 line:-2
will allow
your app to restore Quick Note links,


168
00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:27.094 line:-1
even if the content has been moved around.


169
00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:31.932 line:-2
Although URLs can be unique identifiers
for app content,


170
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:35.035 line:-2
they often contain
transient state information,


171
00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:37.738 line:-2
breaking the identifier guidelines
covered earlier.


172
00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:43.210 line:-2
Quick Note prefers targetContentIdentifier
or persistentIdentifier


173
00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:45.646 line:-1
over webpageURL.


174
00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:48.582 line:-1
webpageURL is perfectly fine to use,


175
00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:51.218 line:-1
as long as it follows the guidelines.


176
00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:57.191 line:-2
If your app uses NSUserActivity for both
state restoration and Spotlight,


177
00:10:57.224 --> 00:11:00.160 line:-2
use the same value
for targetContentIdentifier


178
00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:02.930 line:-1
and persistentIdentifier.


179
00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:05.666 line:-2
If you have a website
that compliments your app,


180
00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:09.169 line:-2
add a URL as a second,
fallback identifier.


181
00:11:09.203 --> 00:11:14.241 line:-2
This way, if the app isn't installed,
opening a link redirects to your website.


182
00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:17.978 line:-2
Another important practice
is making sure the app's


183
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:21.515 line:-1
current NSUserActivity is up to date.


184
00:11:21.548 --> 00:11:23.917 line:-2
This means keeping
up with what is happening.


185
00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:28.922 line:-2
Best practice is to keep the title
and identifier properties accurate


186
00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:31.225 line:-1
when detecting any activity change,


187
00:11:31.258 --> 00:11:33.493 line:-1
like selecting to view a different photo.


188
00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:39.099 line:-2
It's not recommended
to reuse activity instances.


189
00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:43.237 line:-2
When there's new content,
like the new photo, create a new activity.


190
00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:47.908 line:-2
Let UIKit and AppKit handle
the current app activity


191
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:52.446 line:-2
by attaching activities to responders
like viewControllers or views,


192
00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:54.948 line:-1
like I showed in the example code.


193
00:11:54.982 --> 00:11:58.051 line:-2
If attaching to a responder
doesn't work for your app,


194
00:11:58.085 --> 00:12:01.388 line:-2
the current app activity can
be manually managed by calling


195
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.359 line:-2
becomeCurrent() and resignCurrent()
at the appropriate times.


196
00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:08.629 line:-2
For example,
when finished viewing the photo,


197
00:12:08.662 --> 00:12:12.299 line:-2
the app will call resignCurrent()
on the current activity,


198
00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:14.001 line:-1
and when a new photo is picked,


199
00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:17.104 line:-2
the app will call becomeCurrent()
on the new activity.


200
00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:23.977 line:-2
For better performance, take advantage
of the activity's "needsSave" property.


201
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:27.481 line:-2
An activity might need specific
view properties to properly restore


202
00:12:27.514 --> 00:12:29.650 line:-1
the activity in the app.


203
00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:34.154 line:-2
For example,
the position and zoom when viewing a map.


204
00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:37.457 line:-2
These properties can be passed
along with the activity,


205
00:12:37.491 --> 00:12:41.195 line:-2
but there's overhead when
updating after every gesture.


206
00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:44.031 line:-1
Instead of updating the activity,


207
00:12:44.064 --> 00:12:46.867 line:-1
set needsSave to true.


208
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.872 line:-2
When the system needs to send the activity
out to Quick Note linking or Handoff,


209
00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:55.475 line:-2
the delegate callback
userActivityWillSave is invoked,


210
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:58.312 line:-2
so that the app can update
all the properties on demand.


211
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.084 line:-2
This callback is where the userInfo
dictionary can be updated to include


212
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.486 line:-2
any properties that help
with restoring the activity.


213
00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:11.859 line:-2
There are a couple compatibility
issues to prepare for.


214
00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:14.628 line:-1
What if the app has been updated?


215
00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:17.664 line:-1
Take this note with two links from an app.


216
00:13:17.698 --> 00:13:23.003 line:-2
The links could be from an older or newer
version of the app than is on the device.


217
00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:27.140 line:-2
Perfectly fine,
but the links still need to work.


218
00:13:27.174 --> 00:13:29.843 line:-1
To prepare for compatibility handling,


219
00:13:29.877 --> 00:13:32.679 line:-2
have support to handle receiving
activities


220
00:13:32.713 --> 00:13:35.048 line:-1
from earlier versions of your app,


221
00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:38.752 line:-2
and fail gracefully when receiving
activities from newer versions.


222
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.690 line:-2
This could be supported from
versioning your activities,


223
00:13:43.724 --> 00:13:48.228 line:-2
or using a dictionary of keys,
and being tolerant of keys being missing


224
00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:50.197 line:-1
or having some that you don't understand.


225
00:13:50.764 --> 00:13:52.833 line:-1
What if the content doesn't exist anymore?


226
00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:58.272 line:-2
The content the activity linked
to could have been deleted or moved.


227
00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.707 line:-1
When navigating back to the app,


228
00:14:00.741 --> 00:14:03.010 line:-1
show an error message if deleted


229
00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:05.078 line:-1
or redirect if the content was moved.


230
00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:10.450 line:-2
Adopting Quick Note plugs your app
into this new system of note taking.


231
00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:14.555 line:-2
A system designed to improve
the connection between people,


232
00:14:14.588 --> 00:14:17.257 line:-1
content, and your app.


233
00:14:18.058 --> 00:14:20.928 line:-1
Make sure you've adopted NSUserActivity.


234
00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:24.865 line:-2
Now's a great opportunity to revisit
and polish up any existing code.


235
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.704 line:-2
Have unique,
global, and stable identifiers.


236
00:14:30.737 --> 00:14:33.607 line:-2
And set your activities
on responders to let the system


237
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.310 line:-1
manage the app's current NSUserActivity.


238
00:14:36.343 --> 00:14:38.579 line:-2
Thank you for watching,
and I look forward to seeing your app


239
00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:39.947 line:-1
in Quick Note and beyond.
