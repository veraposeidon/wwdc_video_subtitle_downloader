Erik Hornberger: Welcome back to
the third and final installment

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:14.481 line:-1 position:50%
of our Research
and Care app code-along!


8
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.749 line:-1 position:50%
If you'd like to follow along,


9
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,451 line:-1
you can find the source code
for this app


10
00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:19.219 line:-1 position:50%
in the session resources.


11
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,257 line:-1
Let's log in and get started.


12
00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:26.627 line:-1 position:50%
In our last session, we added
a couple of tasks into the app.


13
00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:27.561 line:-1 position:50%
Since then,


14
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,631 line:-1
I've been getting all kinds
of notifications from Jamie.


15
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.866 line:-1 position:50%
I have a feeling
that something's up.


16
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,902 line:-1
Let's see.


17
00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:38.538 line:-1 position:50%
Jamie will arrive at the clinic
in 10 minutes.


18
00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.074 line:-1 position:50%
Jamie shared
a Motivation Playlist.


19
00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.743 line:-1 position:50%
Wow! As you can see,


20
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,412 line:-1
the ever-enthusiastic
Jamie is on his way


21
00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:49.850 line:-1 position:50%
to meet with the clinicians
right now.


22
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.653 line:-1 position:50%
It looks like Jamie has asked us
to make a couple of changes


23
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:56,123 line:-1
and to add two new features.


24
00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:58.592 line:-1 position:50%
The first bit is
about enhancing the surveys


25
00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:00.827 line:-1 position:50%
that we implemented
in session two.


26
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:04,498 line:-1
Jamie says he got some feedback
about them from testers.


27
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,400 line:-1
He told us the feedback that he got


28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,535 line:-1
was that testers
want to be able to tell


29
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:12,706 line:-1
what answers they gave
after the fact.


30
00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.508 line:-1 position:50%
Right now, the card just shows


31
00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:16.977 line:-1 position:50%
that the survey has been
completed,


32
00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:19.713 line:-1 position:50%
but if you scroll
back in time a couple of days,


33
00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:24.384 line:-1 position:50%
there's no way to tell what
answer you gave on that day.


34
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:28,655 line:0
They'd also like us to restrict
editing to the current date.


35
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,425 position:50%
You shouldn't really be able
to delete survey answers


36
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,661 position:50%
or redo range of motion tests
in the past.


37
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.097 line:-1 position:50%
Similarly, it doesn't
really make sense


38
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.166 line:-1 position:50%
that you can scroll out
into the future


39
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:43.570 line:-1 position:50%
and preanswer surveys on days
that haven't come yet.


40
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.139 line:-1 position:50%
So we'll start off
by addressing that feedback


41
00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.175 line:-1 position:50%
and enhancing the surveys a bit.


42
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,843 line:-1
We've also got this Insights tab


43
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,678 line:-1
that's still looking
a bit lonely.


44
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,648 line:-1
Jamie asked that we display
a pair of charts there.


45
00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:56.249 line:-1 position:50%
One will capture
the relationship


46
00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.584 line:-1 position:50%
between sleep and pain,


47
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,120 line:-1
and the other will show
improvement in range of motion


48
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.322 line:-1 position:50%
over time.


49
00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:05.192 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, Jamie tells me
that the doctors have asked


50
00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:07.361 line:-1 position:50%
we include some
educational content


51
00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:10.464 line:-1 position:50%
to help participants understand
what a torn meniscus is,


52
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,966 line:-1
and ResearchKit will be able
to help us out there.


53
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,669 line:-1
We're going to begin
by enhancing the surveys.


54
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,705 line:-1
Let's tackle showing the answers
the patient gave.


55
00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:21.775 line:-1 position:50%
We'll go ahead and display
the given answers as text


56
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,277 line:-1
in the card.


57
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:30,450 line:-1
Now, in CareKit, tweaking
the appearance of a task card


58
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,686 line:-1
is done by passing
a viewSynchronizer


59
00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:34.788 line:-1 position:50%
into its initializer.


60
00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:35.622 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a look


61
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,859 line:-1
at how we can create
a custom View Synchronizer.


62
00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.430 line:-1 position:50%
We'll subclass the existing
OCKSurveyTaskViewSynchronizer.


63
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.233 line:-1 position:50%
This class has two methods
that we can override:


64
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,635 line:-1
makeView and updateView.


65
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,003 line:0
updateView will be called


66
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,906 line:0
every time the data
in the store changes,


67
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,643 line:0
and it's where we can apply
customizations to our view.


68
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,846 position:50%
We always start out by calling
the superclass's implementation


69
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,116 position:50%
and apply our enhancements
on top of that.


70
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,118 line:0
We'll check to see
if there is an event


71
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,487 position:50%
with a completed outcome.


72
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:12,626 line:0
If there is, that means that
the survey has been finished.


73
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,629 position:50%
We'll snag the pain answer
and the sleep answer


74
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,333 position:50%
by referencing the kind property
that we set back in part two.


75
00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.569 line:-1 position:50%
I mentioned that by setting
the kind property,


76
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,304 line:-1
it would help us out later,


77
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,639 line:-1
and this is
one of the applications


78
00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.607 line:-1 position:50%
that I was alluding to.


79
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,576 line:0
Now that we have
the answers handy,


80
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,512 position:50%
we can use string interpolation
to insert the answers


81
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,515 position:50%
into our card's
instruction label.


82
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,851 line:0
And that'll take care
of showing the answers.


83
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:42,622 line:-1
Jamie also asked that we disable
editing of past tasks.


84
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,292 position:50%
One way we can do that
is to first set ourselves


85
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:48,395 line:0
as the delegate
for our survey task cards


86
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,364 position:50%
and then fill in
this delegate method:


87
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,066 position:50%
viewController for task


88
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,635 line:0
shouldAllowDeleting
OutcomeForEvent.


89
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,905 position:50%
Our job is to return a boolean
that tells CareKit


90
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,641 line:0
if it should allow
a particular event's outcome


91
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,643 line:0
to be deleted or not.


92
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,014 position:50%
We'll look at the date
that the event falls on.


93
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,484 line:0
If the date is earlier
than today,


94
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,453 position:50%
we'll say
that it can't be deleted.


95
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:17,924 position:50%
If it is on or after today,
we'll allow deleting it.


96
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,092 line:0
And just like that,


97
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,195 position:50%
we've prevented deletion
of past data.


98
00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:23.497 line:-1 position:50%
The third thing Jamie asked


99
00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:25.565 line:-1 position:50%
is that we also
prevent participants


100
00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:28.802 line:-1 position:50%
from completing surveys
on future dates.


101
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:32,672 position:50%
To do that, we'll climb up
a bit higher in the same file


102
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:36,143 position:50%
to just before where we create
our task view controllers,


103
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,011 position:50%
and we'll use
some Calendar utilities


104
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,281 line:0
to check if the day
we're populating content for


105
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,251 line:0
is in the future or not.


106
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,986 position:50%
If it is a future date,


107
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,622 position:50%
we'll disable interaction
with the task card,


108
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,657 position:50%
and we'll reduce the opacity


109
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:54,161 position:50%
to visually indicate
that it's disabled.


110
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,496 line:0
All right, nice!


111
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:00,167 line:-1
Now we shouldn't be able
to complete future tasks either.


112
00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:02.335 line:-1 position:50%
Let's see where we stand.


113
00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:06.940 line:-1 position:50%
The first thing
that you'll notice


114
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,142 line:-1
is that the answers
that were given for surveys


115
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,946 line:-1
are now displayed
in the survey task cards.


116
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,682 line:0
We still have the option
to delete or redo surveys


117
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,317 position:50%
on the current date,


118
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,886 position:50%
but if we swipe
back into the past,


119
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,556 position:50%
we're no longer able
to redo them.


120
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:26,927 line:-1
And if we jump forward
into the future,


121
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,862 line:-1
we can preview what's coming up,


122
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:32,532 line:-1
but we can't complete
any of the surveys yet.


123
00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:34.701 line:-1 position:50%
Our app is really
coming together now!


124
00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.903 line:-1 position:50%
The last two things
we need to do


125
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,272 line:-1
are the charts
and educational content,


126
00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:42.108 line:-1 position:50%
and these are both
in the Insights tab.


127
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,544 line:-1
We're going to start off
with a two-series bar chart


128
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:48,882 line:-1
showing the pain rating
and hours of sleep side by side.


129
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,050 position:50%
We'll need to create two


130
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,386 line:0
OCKDataSeriesConfiguration
objects.


131
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,223 line:0
The first is
for the pain series.


132
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,191 line:0
The ID tells CareKit


133
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,294 position:50%
which task's data
to plot on the chart.


134
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:06,466 line:0
We'll also pass a legend title,
colors, a marker size --


135
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,501 position:50%
which determines
how wide the bars will be --


136
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,870 line:0
and an event aggregator.


137
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,872 line:0
The event aggregator
is responsible


138
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,009 line:0
for looking at all the events
that occur on a given day


139
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:22,048 position:50%
to determine what Y value
should be used on that day.


140
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,483 position:50%
For the check-in task,


141
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:27,254 line:0
we know there will only ever be
one event per day,


142
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,489 line:0
so we can just take
the first event


143
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:33,159 position:50%
and get the answer
to the pain question.


144
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,562 position:50%
So that's the pain series
configuration.


145
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,265 line:0
We'll also need one for sleep.


146
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:41,668 line:0
The sleep series
is almost identical.


147
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,871 position:50%
We're plotting data from
the exact same check-in task.


148
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,341 position:50%
The difference is that
we display the sleep answer,


149
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,378 position:50%
instead of the pain answer.


150
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,280 position:50%
With both of these in hand,


151
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,616 line:0
we can construct
a chart view controller.


152
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:01,054 position:50%
We'll choose a bar chart
and set the date to today.


153
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,658 position:50%
Of course, we also need
to pass in our two series


154
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,760 position:50%
and a reference
to the store manager,


155
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,828 position:50%
which is used
to keep the chart up to date


156
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,298 position:50%
as the content
of the store changes.


157
00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:12.766 line:-1 position:50%
Great, so that's
our first chart.


158
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,567 line:-1
Let's make one more!


159
00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:16.403 line:-1 position:50%
This time,
it's going to be a scatter chart


160
00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:18.972 line:-1 position:50%
for range of motion.


161
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,274 position:50%
We'll need to create
a data series configuration


162
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,010 line:0
just as we did before,
but this time around,


163
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,079 position:50%
we'll only need one.


164
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,049 position:50%
The only difference this time
is that we're plotting data


165
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,885 position:50%
from the range of motion task
instead of check-in task,


166
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:36,990 position:50%
and we're using the range answer
for the Y axis.


167
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,326 position:50%
Next, we'll create
our view controller.


168
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,861 line:0
This time it's going
to be a scatter plot,


169
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,632 line:0
and we only have
one data series.


170
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,966 line:0
And just like that,


171
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,603 line:0
we've got both
of our charts set up.


172
00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:55.308 line:-1 position:50%
Let's see how they look.


173
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,544 line:-1
Jumping over
the Insights tab,


174
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:01,181 line:-1
we can see both of our charts
are now rendering.


175
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,117 line:-1
They look really nice!


176
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,752 position:50%
If we jump back,


177
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,321 position:50%
and we add or delete
some outcomes --


178
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,292 line:0
here, we'll delete both
outcomes for Tuesday --


179
00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:14.894 line:-1 position:50%
and then return
to the Insights tab,


180
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,464 line:-1
we should see our charts
updated automatically.


181
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,431 line:-1
And they have!


182
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,401 line:-1
There's no longer any data
being shown for Tuesday.


183
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,970 line:-1
Nice!
So charts are looking good.


184
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.439 line:-1 position:50%
Jamie also asked
that we give the participants


185
00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:30.377 line:-1 position:50%
an option to view a 3D model
of the knee and the meniscus,


186
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,778 line:-1
along with some explanatory text


187
00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.147 line:-1 position:50%
he received
from our clinical partners.


188
00:08:34.147 --> 00:08:36.182 line:-1 position:50%
ResearchKit can help us out
with that.


189
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,386 line:-1
I'd like to pause for a second
to note that this time around,


190
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:44,758 line:-1
we are not tying the ResearchKit
survey to a CareKit schedule.


191
00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:46.726 line:-1 position:50%
There's no particular time


192
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,130 line:-1
at which we want participants
to look at this content,


193
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,632 line:-1
so we don't need
the notion of a schedule.


194
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,168 line:-1
Similarly, there aren't
any results for us


195
00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:57.270 line:-1 position:50%
to persist
into CareKit's store,


196
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,572 line:-1
so we don't need
to create a CareKit task


197
00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:03.009 line:-1 position:50%
or use CareKit's
survey task view controller.


198
00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:06.179 line:-1 position:50%
That said, we can use
the FeaturedContent view


199
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:12,452 line:-1
that my teammate Gavi
introduced at WWDC last year.


200
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,354 line:-1
We'll need to set ourselves
as the delegate


201
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,555 line:-1
so that we can be told


202
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,958 line:-1
when the participant taps
the featured content card.


203
00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.760 line:-1 position:50%
When they do,


204
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.363 line:-1 position:50%
we'll create a kneeModelTask,


205
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,566 line:-1
wrap it in an
ORKTaskViewController,


206
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.702 line:-1 position:50%
and present it
to the participant.


207
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,337 line:0
When they're done
viewing the model,


208
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,807 position:50%
we'll get a callback right here,


209
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,708 position:50%
and we can use that
as an opportunity


210
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,244 line:0
to dismiss the ResearchKit
view controller


211
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,415 line:0
and bring the participant back
into the Insights tab.


212
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,117 position:50%
All right, very nice!


213
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,252 position:50%
But we are missing
a definition here


214
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,521 position:50%
for this knee task.


215
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:53,526 line:0
Let's go fill that in
over in Surveys.swift.


216
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,895 position:50%
It's going to be
just two steps,


217
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,766 position:50%
where the first is going
to be an instruction step.


218
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,202 position:50%
I hope these are starting
to feel at least a little bit


219
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,670 line:0
familiar to you by now,


220
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,674 position:50%
since we used them
several times already today.


221
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:11,077 position:50%
The second step
is a 3D model step.


222
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,413 position:50%
Whenever we create
a 3D model step,


223
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,382 line:0
we also need to pass in
a modelManager,


224
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,784 position:50%
so just up above it,


225
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:22,422 position:50%
we'll create a USDZ
model manager to pass in.


226
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,258 position:50%
We're going to start off
by displaying a toy robot


227
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:29,128 position:50%
just to make sure
that everything is working.


228
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,065 line:0
The last bit is to assemble
an ordered task


229
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:36,769 position:50%
with both of our steps
and to return it.


230
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:40.073 line:-1 position:50%
Now, when we run our app,


231
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:44,143 line:-1
we'll see the featured content
card in the Insights tab,


232
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:48,047 line:0
and tapping on it will bring up
our instruction step,


233
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,517 position:50%
followed by our toy robot model.


234
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:55,154 position:50%
We can interact with it
by rotating, zooming in on it...


235
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,457 line:-1
pretty neat!


236
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,793 line:-1
If you'd like to know more about
how the 3D model manager works,


237
00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:03.396 line:-1 position:50%
or how you can implement
your own version of it,


238
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,600 line:-1
you can check out Pariece's
WWDC session from last year.


239
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.835 line:-1 position:50%
To finish up our app,


240
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,637 line:-1
I'm going to swap out
our toy robot


241
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,839 line:-1
for BioDigital's model manager.


242
00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.341 line:-1 position:50%
We'll include some notes on this
in the project's Read Me,


243
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.911 line:-1 position:50%
in case you're interested
in knowing the details.


244
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,180 position:50%
With this version
of the model manager,


245
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,852 position:50%
we can provide educational text
from the clinicians.


246
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,221 position:50%
Here you can see some content


247
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,356 position:50%
provided
by our clinical partners.


248
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,425 position:50%
We can also highlight
the meniscus


249
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,027 position:50%
for the participant's reference


250
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,262 line:0
to help them understand
more about their injury


251
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,599 position:50%
and what the path
to recovery will be.


252
00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:42.402 line:-1 position:50%
Our app is really
coming together now!


253
00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:45.071 line:-1 position:50%
Actually, that's it,
that is everything!


254
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,207 line:-1
We have checked
all of the boxes!


255
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,909 line:-1
[FACETIME RINGING]


256
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,878 line:-1
And just in
the nick of time, too!


257
00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:57.984 line:-1 position:50%
It looks like we're getting
another call from Jamie.


258
00:11:57.984 --> 00:11:59.419 line:-1 position:50%
Hey Jamie, good timing!


259
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,488 line:-1
We just wrapped up everything
that you asked us to do.


260
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,758 line:-1
Jamie: Oh wow, yeah. I'm taking
a look at it right now, Erik.


261
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:06,859 line:-1
Let's see...


262
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,395 line:-1
Yeah, this is really
coming along nicely.


263
00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.130 line:-1 position:50%
The rest of the team
is going to be thrilled,


264
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.967 line:-1 position:50%
and this is going to open up
so many research opportunities!


265
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,268 line:-1
Quick question for you.


266
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,337 line:-1
Before I head into this next meeting,


267
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,771 line:-1
what should I tell
the team to do


268
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,106 line:-1
if they have any questions
for you?


269
00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.541 line:-1 position:50%
Erik: Hey, that's a good
question!


270
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,577 line:-1
So ResearchKit and CareKit
are both open source,


271
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,412 line:-1
and our team is active
on GitHub.


272
00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.047 line:-1 position:50%
If they have any questions
about the frameworks,


273
00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:30.016 line:-1 position:50%
if they want to request
a new feature,


274
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,451 line:-1
or if they want to contribute,


275
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:35,088 line:-1
tell them to open a new issue
on our GitHub repos.


276
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,589 line:-1
Jamie: OK yeah,
that's fantastic.


277
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,791 line:-1
I'll pass that info along
to the team.


278
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,026 line:-1
Erik: By the way Jamie,


279
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,395 line:-1
you should consider telling us
more about your study!


280
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,030 line:-1
If you go to
researchandcare.org,


281
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.299 line:-1 position:50%
you'll find a link there
that you can use to tell Apple


282
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,601 line:-1
the details about
who your study helps.


283
00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.736 line:-1 position:50%
We love to hear about


284
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,405 line:-1
how our frameworks
are being used by the community!


285
00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:54.641 line:-1 position:50%
We also have
an Investigator Support Program


286
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,609 line:-1
that offers grants
of Apple Watch


287
00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:59.746 line:-1 position:50%
to institutions that propose
novel research studies.


288
00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:00.880 line:-1 position:50%
If they want to apply,


289
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.950 line:-1 position:50%
they can find the details
on our website as well.


290
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,319 line:-1
Jamie: Really?
That's fantastic!


291
00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:09.322 line:-1 position:50%
I think they'll definitely
want to take advantage of that.


292
00:13:09.322 --> 00:13:11.958 line:-1 position:50%
But, Erik, all right I've got
to pop into another meeting.


293
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,093 line:-1
I've got tons of big ideas
for a second app


294
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,862 line:-1
that I want to run by you later.


295
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,098 line:-1
How long do you think an app
for Apple Watch would take?


296
00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:23.703 line:-1 position:50%
Erik: All right, but let's
catch up and discuss that later;


297
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,171 line:-1
like, in a couple of days.


298
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,807 line:-1
I think I've got enough
to keep me busy for a while!


299
00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.742 line:-1 position:50%
Jamie: Oh yeah, I heard
you're doing a code-along


300
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,678 line:-1
this year for WWDC?


301
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,345 line:-1
Good luck with that!


302
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,347 line:-1
I'll talk to you later!
[FACETIME END CHIME]


303
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:37,650 line:-1
Erik: [LAUGHS]
If you'd like more info,


304
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,286 line:-1
you can find it on
researchandcare.org.


305
00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:42.221 line:-1 position:50%
Source code is available
on GitHub,


306
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,824 line:0
and we have two other sessions
this year


307
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,061 line:0
that lead up to the one
you just watched.


308
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:50.363 line:-1 position:50%
Well, that's all we've got
for you folks.


309
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,732 line:-1
Thank you for joining us
for our code-along!


310
00:13:52.732 --> 00:13:54.233 line:-1 position:50%
We saw how
our sibling frameworks,


311
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,935 line:-1
ResearchKit and CareKit,


312
00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:58.771 line:-1 position:50%
can be used in tandem
to quickly iterate on an app.


313
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,707 line:-1
