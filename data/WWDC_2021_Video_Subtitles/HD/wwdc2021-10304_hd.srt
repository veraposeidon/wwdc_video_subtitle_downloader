Caroline Cranfill: Hi,
I’m Caroline Cranfill,


7
00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.480 line:-1 position:50%
a designer on
the Apple Design team.


8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,115 line:-1
Later, I’ll be joined
by my colleagues,


9
00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.251 line:-1 position:50%
Cynthia and Sabrine.


10
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,019 line:-1
People are both
equally important


11
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.988 line:-1 position:50%
and very different
from one another.


12
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,624 line:-1
Considering each person
can broaden your market,


13
00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:25.292 line:-1 position:50%
lead to a more popular app,


14
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:28,262 line:-1
and is so much more
than the right thing to do.


15
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:31,164 line:-1
Achieving this ambitious goal
will require you to think


16
00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:34.268 line:-1 position:50%
from the very beginning
about how to ensure


17
00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:37.738 line:-1 position:50%
your app will empower
and delight everyone,


18
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,406 line:-1
and not just at the beginning.


19
00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:40.741 line:-1 position:50%
As with all projects,


20
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.343 line:-1 position:50%
designing and developing
for inclusiveness


21
00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:46.780 line:-1 position:50%
is an iterative process
that requires you to examine


22
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.784 line:-1 position:50%
your assumptions about how
other people think and feel.


23
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,287 line:-1
Although each person’s
perspective is unique,


24
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:56,723 line:-1
inclusive design and development
benefits from focusing hard


25
00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.026 line:-1 position:50%
on certain axes of diversity.


26
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,994 line:-1
This can help us think
more broadly


27
00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.530 line:-1 position:50%
than our own experiences.


28
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,066 line:-1
Diversity axes
can include class; culture;


29
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,535 line:-1
ethnicity; language; education;


30
00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.972 line:-1 position:50%
political, philosophical
and religious beliefs;


31
00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:14.908 line:-1 position:50%
race; gender;
sexual orientation;


32
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,411 line:0
age; abilities; disabilities;


33
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,379 position:50%
whether you are right-
or left-handed;


34
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,114 line:0
body measurements like height;


35
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,284 line:0
and also environmental
conditions like location,


36
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:28,355 position:50%
internet connectivity,
or access to technology devices.


37
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,458 line:0
Each of these provide
spectrums of perspectives --


38
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,860 position:50%
and even more
unique experiences --


39
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,629 position:50%
when you consider
the intersections


40
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:39,466 position:50%
of multiple axes
at any given time.


41
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.568 line:-1 position:50%
For example,
how will your app perform


42
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,272 line:-1
if there is no high-speed
Internet or data is limited?


43
00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.441 line:-1 position:50%
Or, will your app be welcoming


44
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.577 line:-1 position:50%
for people across the spectrum
of gender identities


45
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:54,348 line:-1
and LGBTQ+ communities?


46
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,816 line:-1
As you view your app or game


47
00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:57.651 line:-1 position:50%
through many
different perspectives,


48
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,554 line:-1
inclusiveness is about
making people feel welcome


49
00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:02.189 line:-1 position:50%
and considered.


50
00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.790 line:-1 position:50%
People who use it should feel


51
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,694 line:-1
that you designed with their
life experiences in mind.


52
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,497 line:-1
Because your app can be used
by people around the world,


53
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,867 line:-1
it lends to celebrating
humanity and difference.


54
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,737 line:-1
Today, we will discuss how
creating apps or games


55
00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:18.271 line:-1 position:50%
for a diverse set of people


56
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:22.275 line:-1 position:50%
requires inclusivity to be
infused into how you work


57
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,379 line:-1
just as much
as what you choose to make.


58
00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.147 line:-1 position:50%
Before we dive into specifics,


59
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,816 line:-1
I will talk through
some common misconceptions


60
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,019 line:-1
around inclusive design
and development


61
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,354 line:-1
and how you can
think differently.


62
00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:37.691 line:-1 position:50%
At first, it may feel
like inclusion is hard.


63
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:41,461 line:-1
But I would like to reframe this
as, "Inclusion is a journey."


64
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,729 line:-1
Lots of things are hard,


65
00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.665 line:-1 position:50%
but we do them anyway
when they’re worthwhile.


66
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,835 line:-1
Change is an iterative process
and takes time.


67
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,738 line:-1
Meaningful change requires
planning, persistence,


68
00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.273 line:-1 position:50%
and patience.


69
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,943 line:-1
The benefits are high, because
you can improve quality of life,


70
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:01,448 line:-1
enable people to achieve
new goals, or try new things.


71
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,649 line:-1
Another misconception


72
00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.652 line:-1 position:50%
is that inclusive design
limits creativity.


73
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,188 line:-1
In truth, inclusive design
and development


74
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.957 line:-1 position:50%
stimulates new
creative solutions.


75
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,594 line:-1
Wider context and awareness
can promote progress in areas


76
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,197 line:-1
that you may have
never considered before.


77
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,033 line:-1
You can make breakthroughs
in experiences for everyone


78
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.069 line:-1 position:50%
that wouldn’t happen
if you didn’t consider


79
00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.905 line:-1 position:50%
the diversity
of human experience.


80
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,641 line:-1
Inclusion doesn’t mean
turning down innovative ideas


81
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:29.109 line:-1 position:50%
or asking all people to accept


82
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,845 line:-1
a lowest common denominator
experience.


83
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,447 line:-1
Constraints help your process


84
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,283 line:-1
by helping you make
the first few early decisions.


85
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,285 line:-1
This allows you to put
most of your energy


86
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,855 line:-1
into creating new solutions
in a narrow problem space.


87
00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:43.590 line:-1 position:50%
Let me share
an example with you.


88
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,593 line:-1
A team at Apple figured out how
they can use our Apple products


89
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,729 line:-1
to add a layer of intelligence
to our physical world.


90
00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.298 line:-1 position:50%
They first wanted to focus


91
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,733 line:-1
on recognizing
a few objects and text,


92
00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.836 line:-1 position:50%
which in itself is a constraint.


93
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,871 line:0
But they didn’t just stop there.


94
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:01,541 line:0
They explored ways to surface
buttons to call, message,


95
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,212 line:0
add to contacts, or copy
recognized phone numbers.


96
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,480 line:0
It’s helpful to me


97
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,182 position:50%
but essential for people
who are blind or low vision


98
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,818 line:0
to interact with printed
materials like signs,


99
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,720 line:0
business cards, and envelopes.


100
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,490 line:0
Not only can people
who are blind read this text,


101
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,193 line:0
they can act on it to make calls
and save contacts.


102
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:23,763 position:50%
This brings us to
a misconception about teams.


103
00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.632 line:-1 position:50%
You may think
that having a diverse team


104
00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:28.368 line:-1 position:50%
means your app or game
will be inclusive.


105
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:32,005 line:-1
In truth, having an empowered
diverse team


106
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,142 line:-1
means your app
or game can be inclusive.


107
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,444 line:-1
We all share
the responsibility to build


108
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:41,615 line:-1
an inclusive environment
that enables inclusive actions.


109
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,817 line:-1
You’re more engaged
when you feel comfortable


110
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,719 line:-1
voicing your ideas and opinions.


111
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,688 line:-1
And when those thoughts come
from a diverse group of people,


112
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,559 line:-1
it fosters more creativity
and innovation.


113
00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.362 line:-1 position:50%
At Apple, the accessibility
engineers work hand in hand


114
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,598 line:-1
with a wide array of teams
to help solve unique problems


115
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,401 line:-1
that affect only
a certain group of people.


116
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,337 line:-1
For example, a person
who is blind or has low vision


117
00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:07.541 line:-1 position:50%
might have difficulty knowing
when to move forward in a line


118
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,176 line:-1
independently.


119
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,912 line:-1
A solution started with
the video engineering team


120
00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:14.748 line:-1 position:50%
using the technology
called "LiDAR."


121
00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:18.084 line:-1 position:50%
It uses a pulsed laser
to ping nearby objects


122
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,955 line:-1
to generate a 3D model
of the surrounding environment.


123
00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:24.591 line:-1 position:50%
The teams were empowered
to work together


124
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,694 line:-1
to create and release
the People Detection feature


125
00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:29.496 line:-1 position:50%
in the Magnifier app.


126
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,865 position:50%
It allows you to know
the distance between you


127
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,568 line:0
and the people around you.


128
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,137 line:0
What started as a prototype
to make life more convenient


129
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,839 position:50%
became a necessity
once COVID-19 hit.


130
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,143 position:50%
Our team's ongoing conversations
with the blind community


131
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,178 position:50%
led to a more pressing issue:


132
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,314 line:0
How does a blind
or low-vision person


133
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,784 position:50%
practice social distancing?


134
00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:51.952 line:-1 position:50%
One more misconception


135
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:55,088 line:-1
is that inclusion
can be done at the very end.


136
00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.257 line:-1 position:50%
Considering inclusion
and the experience


137
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:00,360 line:-1
that each individual person --
or groups of people --


138
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,830 line:-1
have with your app or game
must be considered upfront


139
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,267 line:-1
and carried throughout
the design and development.


140
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,569 line:-1
Waiting until the end
is reactionary,


141
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,739 line:-1
and there often isn’t
enough time to correct.


142
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,542 line:-1
More than small changes
become risky.


143
00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.044 line:-1 position:50%
This doesn’t mean you have
to get it right from the start,


144
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,580 line:-1
but that it's being considered
from the start.


145
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.083 line:-1 position:50%
Now we can build
on these reframings


146
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,987 line:-1
to empower us to create
more inclusive apps or games.


147
00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:30.724 line:-1 position:50%
To start, you can take
a deeper look into how you work.


148
00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.927 line:-1 position:50%
You can be in a better position
to achieve your inclusion goals


149
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:37,364 line:-1
if you first look
at the diversity of your teams


150
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:41,167 line:-1
in creating inclusive
working environments.


151
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,371 line:-1
At Apple, we believe our teams
should reflect the diverse,


152
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,740 line:-1
ever-evolving world we serve.


153
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,808 line:-1
People are drawn
to like-mindedness,


154
00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:50.710 line:-1 position:50%
consensus, and agreement.


155
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,680 line:-1
It feels comfortable
and takes less mental energy,


156
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,916 line:-1
but it doesn’t always
get you the best results.


157
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,852 line:-1
When you see difference
as an asset,


158
00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:00.253 line:-1 position:50%
rather than a challenge,


159
00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.756 line:-1 position:50%
you open yourself
to new possibilities,


160
00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:06.159 line:-1 position:50%
creative thinking, and
productive new relationships


161
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,329 line:-1
that help you
make better decisions.


162
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,931 line:-1
In some ways, small companies
are better positioned


163
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.600 line:-1 position:50%
to build more inclusive teams


164
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,336 line:-1
if you commit
to diversity early.


165
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,405 line:-1
People tend to hire
those they know,


166
00:07:18.405 --> 00:07:19.439 line:-1 position:50%
which poses the risk


167
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.208 line:-1 position:50%
of them having
very similar perspectives.


168
00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:24.644 line:-1 position:50%
If you instead bring on
someone different from you,


169
00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:28.081 line:-1 position:50%
you have an easier path
to making diversity a core value


170
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:31,851 line:-1
from the get-go rather
than rushing to fix it later on.


171
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,888 line:-1
And as you grow your teams,
think “culture add,”


172
00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:36.623 line:-1 position:50%
rather than “culture fit.”


173
00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.458 line:-1 position:50%
What perspectives
are you missing


174
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,660 line:-1
and how could finding
that perspective


175
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,129 line:-1
change your app for the better?


176
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,564 line:-1
Your team can be diverse,


177
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,700 line:-1
but it’s often
that diverse perspectives


178
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,169 line:-1
are not incorporated
in meaningful ways


179
00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.205 line:-1 position:50%
that impact decision making.


180
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,941 line:-1
You want to make sure
you are actively creating space


181
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,845 line:-1
and asking for perspectives
in a judgment-free way.


182
00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.447 line:-1 position:50%
To create safe spaces,


183
00:08:00.447 --> 00:08:04.217 line:-1 position:50%
teams need time and space
to think inclusively.


184
00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:05.885 line:-1 position:50%
Protect this time.


185
00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:08.421 line:-1 position:50%
The design and development
process can be rigid


186
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:09.456 line:-1 position:50%
and unwavering,


187
00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:12.192 line:-1 position:50%
so much so that you don’t feel
like you can take time


188
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,562 line:-1
to reflect and think about
what you are making.


189
00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:17.597 line:-1 position:50%
Fast development
also doesn’t allow you


190
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:21,768 line:-1
to incorporate the diverse
perspectives from your teams.


191
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,637 line:-1
Now we will look at the design
and development process


192
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,040 line:-1
more closely, and I will share
tips and pointers


193
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,942 line:-1
to consider during each phase.


194
00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:31.211 line:-1 position:50%
If you were to illustrate
the process,


195
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,246 line:-1
you may first think of it
as a line


196
00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:35.915 line:-1 position:50%
with point A
of formulating the idea


197
00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:38.118 line:-1 position:50%
to point B of releasing.


198
00:08:38.118 --> 00:08:39.853 line:-1 position:50%
In the middle
are lengths for phases


199
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,590 line:-1
like design, development,
and testing.


200
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.358 line:-1 position:50%
Much like security or privacy,


201
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,261 line:-1
inclusion cannot be treated
as an afterthought.


202
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,463 line:-1
Since you don’t want
to release your app or game


203
00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:53.099 line:-1 position:50%
and discover that it doesn’t
work well for everyone,


204
00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.869 line:-1 position:50%
you can dedicate
and reserve time to pause,


205
00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.605 line:-1 position:50%
think, and pivot throughout
the whole process,


206
00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:00.974 line:-1 position:50%
not just at the end.


207
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,944 line:-1
It really becomes a
rejuvenating, iterative process.


208
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,647 line:-1
Taking time out of each phase
to reflect,


209
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,015 line:-1
ask some key questions,


210
00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:12.619 line:-1 position:50%
can be helpful to evaluate
what you are making.


211
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,188 line:-1
It may feel like you are
looping back momentarily,


212
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,624 line:-1
but the new, more inclusive path
will ultimately


213
00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:20.527 line:-1 position:50%
make the app or game
relate to more people.


214
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,895 line:-1
It will also give you more time


215
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,897 line:-1
to tackle things
that may be complex


216
00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:27.167 line:-1 position:50%
and require longer time
to solve.


217
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,502 line:-1
Now we will discuss
what you can ask yourself


218
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,372 line:-1
or do during each phase.


219
00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:34.441 line:-1 position:50%
First, we’ll start
when you ideate


220
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.443 line:-1 position:50%
on what you are going to make.


221
00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:38.011 line:-1 position:50%
Everyone working
on the app or game


222
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,280 line:-1
should be able
to answer the question:


223
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,150 line:-1
Why are you making this?
Will everyone relate to it?


224
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,220 line:-1
Clarify the purpose of the app
or game you are creating.


225
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.856 line:-1 position:50%
What human good
are you trying to serve?


226
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,891 line:-1
How will people be better off?


227
00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:55.495 line:-1 position:50%
What does it enable people
to do, be, or feel?


228
00:09:55.495 --> 00:09:58.731 line:-1 position:50%
Next, also ask,
who are you making it for?


229
00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:01.935 line:-1 position:50%
Don’t just think of people who
use the app or game currently.


230
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,171 line:-1
Think through the lens
of the different diversity axes.


231
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,674 line:-1
Which specific dimensions
or intersections


232
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:08,942 line:-1
have you considered,


233
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,578 line:-1
and what will
their experience be?


234
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,214 line:-1
Next, challenge your assumptions
and listen.


235
00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:17.584 line:-1 position:50%
Actively listen and learn about
the experiences and perspectives


236
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,553 line:-1
very different from your own
and those commonly valued


237
00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:23.089 line:-1 position:50%
by your design
and development team.


238
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,959 line:-1
Your educational journey
will uncover new areas


239
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,861 line:-1
to concentrate on.


240
00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:30.196 line:-1 position:50%
The next phase of the design
and development process


241
00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.631 line:-1 position:50%
is design.


242
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.869 line:-1 position:50%
When ideas are coming to focus,
it’s time to think concretely


243
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,339 line:-1
about the extremes of how people
will use the app or game,


244
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,441 line:-1
not just the average person.


245
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,943 line:-1
It may be that an
unconsidered intersection


246
00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:48.014 line:-1 position:50%
is preventing people from
wanting to use your app or game.


247
00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:51.718 line:-1 position:50%
Next, consider the emotional,
social, and physical impact


248
00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:54.587 line:-1 position:50%
on the people
who use your app or game.


249
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,789 line:-1
Are some populations
or groups of people


250
00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:59.626 line:-1 position:50%
more likely to have
negative experiences?


251
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:03,963 line:-1
Are these populations also
vulnerable or disadvantaged?


252
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,299 line:-1
If so, do you understand why,


253
00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:08.801 line:-1 position:50%
and what is being
done about this?


254
00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:11.871 line:-1 position:50%
Next, consider the impact
of location and context


255
00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:13.339 line:-1 position:50%
on the experience.


256
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,675 line:-1
Context is about
the circumstances


257
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.344 line:-1 position:50%
of the people using your app.


258
00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:21.981 line:-1 position:50%
It can span across several
diversity axes like culture,


259
00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:25.118 line:-1 position:50%
environment, location,
and connectivity.


260
00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:27.453 line:-1 position:50%
You can consider
how in some cultures,


261
00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:29.856 line:-1 position:50%
multiple generations of families
may live together


262
00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.791 line:-1 position:50%
in one household.


263
00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:34.594 line:-1 position:50%
People may live in cities
or rural areas,


264
00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:36.863 line:-1 position:50%
and both have different needs.


265
00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:40.333 line:-1 position:50%
You can consider environments
may be noisy or quiet,


266
00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:43.436 line:-1 position:50%
bright or dark,
or small or large.


267
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:47,273 line:-1
For example, roommates
or friends using an AppleTV


268
00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:49.576 line:-1 position:50%
may have a different experience
and needs


269
00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:53.246 line:-1 position:50%
from families with children
who use an AppleTV.


270
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:56,316 line:-1
The next phase of the design
and development process


271
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,018 line:-1
is when you start
to develop your designs.


272
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,088 line:-1
It’s important
to have inclusive representation


273
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,525 line:-1
or relevant expertise
throughout development.


274
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,760 line:-1
As you evaluate
prototypes or designs,


275
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.663 line:-1 position:50%
be sure to explicitly include
a diverse group of people


276
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,632 line:-1
when solutions
are being discussed


277
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,901 line:-1
and decisions are being made.


278
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,404 line:-1
Diverse voices can provide
context and strengthen reasons


279
00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:23.009 line:-1 position:50%
on why the app or game
is going down a certain path.


280
00:12:23.009 --> 00:12:25.078 line:-1 position:50%
Next, start planning
for accessibility


281
00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:28.514 line:-1 position:50%
and internationalization
at the beginning of development.


282
00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:29.549 line:-1 position:50%
Apple ships products


283
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,417 line:-1
with lots of built-in
accessibility features


284
00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:33.186 line:-1 position:50%
for people with disabilities,


285
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,422 line:-1
who are 15 percent
of the world’s population.


286
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,424 line:-1
And the number of people
living with disabilities


287
00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:40.927 line:-1 position:50%
is increasing
due to aging populations


288
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,229 line:-1
and chronic health conditions.


289
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,964 line:-1
The people who use
your apps or games


290
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,734 line:-1
need you
to make them accessible.


291
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:50,703 line:-1
Take time now to understand
different accessibility


292
00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:52.639 line:-1 position:50%
and localization APIs,


293
00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:56.042 line:-1 position:50%
so everything is in place
as features are developed.


294
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:59,579 line:-1
Standard UIKit, AppKit,
or SwiftUI controls and views


295
00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:02.382 line:-1 position:50%
implement the
UIAccessibility methods


296
00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:04.450 line:-1 position:50%
and are accessible by default,


297
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.953 line:-1 position:50%
but you will need to plan
for more time


298
00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:08.488 line:-1 position:50%
to make your apps accessible


299
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,758 line:-1
if you are using
custom controls or views.


300
00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:14.327 line:-1 position:50%
Before wrapping up the design
and development phases,


301
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,963 line:-1
I’m going to hand it over
to Cynthia to share an example


302
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,933 line:-1
of considering
intersectionality in innovation.


303
00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.035 line:-1 position:50%
Cynthia Bennett:
I’m Cynthia Bennett,


304
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,236 line:-1
and I’m a researcher


305
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,905 line:-1
on the AI
and Machine Learning team.


306
00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:29.842 line:-1 position:50%
Our team designed and developed
one inclusive experience --


307
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,346 line:-1
powered by machine learning --
which centered a perspective


308
00:13:33.346 --> 00:13:36.816 line:-1 position:50%
at the intersection
of two of the diversity axes.


309
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:37.884 line:-1 position:50%
And I’ll explain


310
00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:40.920 line:-1 position:50%
how learning from organizations
outside of Apple


311
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.090 line:-1 position:50%
helped us to develop
a better feature.


312
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.825 line:-1 position:50%
To provide some background,


313
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,727 line:-1
people who are blind
or low vision


314
00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:51.064 line:-1 position:50%
access Apple products
with our advanced screen reader,


315
00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:52.098 line:-1 position:50%
VoiceOver.


316
00:13:52.098 --> 00:13:56.703 line:-1 position:50%
With VoiceOver, people who use
our devices can navigate apps,


317
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,839 line:-1
chat with friends,
and do much, much more.


318
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,774 line:-1
Let me show you

331
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,412 line:-1
may not be able to see
what is in Photos,


332
00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:42.281 line:-1 position:50%
but they want to enjoy them
just like everyone else.


333
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:45.151 line:-1 position:50%
Image descriptions --
or textual information


334
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,887 line:-1
about the most important things
shown in photos --


335
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,722 line:-1
may accompany photos.


336
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,092 line:-1
So to create great and
inclusive photos experiences,


337
00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:56.462 line:-1 position:50%
Apple has worked on supporting
image descriptions.


338
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,664 line:0
In iOS 15, you can use


339
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,833 position:50%
the Description feature
of Markup


340
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,803 position:50%
to write your own descriptions
of photos.


341
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:06,105 position:50%
These image descriptions
are then sent


342
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,242 line:0
whenever you share photos
across Apple products.


343
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:13,212 position:50%
The human-written description
for this photo is,


344
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,249 position:50%
“Side-profile of a giraffe
walking in the savanna


345
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,751 line:0
with trees in the distance.”


346
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,154 line:-1
But there are a lot of photos
out there


347
00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:24.090 line:-1 position:50%
and many of them
do not have descriptions.


348
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.526 line:-1 position:50%
Machine learning is
a tool that can help.


349
00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:30.196 line:-1 position:50%
A machine-learning-trained model
can generate image descriptions


350
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:33,599 line:-1
automatically, quickly,
and at scale.


351
00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.701 line:-1 position:50%
So our team trained a model


352
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,438 line:-1
to generate detailed natural
language descriptions of images


353
00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:42.208 line:-1 position:50%
across iOS, which we call


354
00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:45.278 line:-1 position:50%
VoiceOver Recognition
image descriptions.


355
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,114 line:-1
Let’s listen to the VoiceOver
Recognition image description


356
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,016 line:-1
of this photo.


357
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:54,053 line:-1
>> VoiceOver: A giraffe standing
on a dry, grassy field.


358
00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:58.291 line:-1 position:50%
But even state-of-the-art
machine learning is not enough.


359
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,093 line:-1
Inclusion must be intentional.


360
00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:05.298 line:-1 position:50%
So our team needed to understand
how the image descriptions model


361
00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:08.968 line:-1 position:50%
described all people,
not just average people.


362
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,802 line:-1
If you’re working on


363
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,004 line:-1
machine-learning-powered
features,


364
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,441 line:-1
one place to start is to learn
how different groups of people


365
00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:17.810 line:-1 position:50%
are represented
by machine learning.


366
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.213 line:-1 position:50%
And this is a step
everyone can take,


367
00:16:20.213 --> 00:16:22.114 line:-1 position:50%
whether you’re working
on your own


368
00:16:22.114 --> 00:16:24.150 line:-1 position:50%
or at a large company.


369
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,219 line:-1
Keep those diversity axes
in mind


370
00:16:26.219 --> 00:16:29.689 line:-1 position:50%
when thinking about what groups
you should prioritize.


371
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:32.291 line:-1 position:50%
One aspect of machine learning
representation


372
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,660 line:-1
that our team learned more about


373
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,697 line:-1
was how people’s gender
would be described.


374
00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:39.732 line:-1 position:50%
We learned that so far,


375
00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:45.238 line:-1 position:50%
models tend to represent
two genders: female and male.


376
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,341 line:-1
But we know that people
may be a variety of genders,


377
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:52.011 line:-1 position:50%
including being non-binary
or transgender.


378
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.246 line:-1 position:50%
In this case,


379
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:57,516 line:-1
representation did not align
with everyone’s gender.


380
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,253 line:-1
You might ask,
why does this matter?


381
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,189 line:-1
What does gender have to do
with making photos inclusive


382
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:04.490 line:-1 position:50%
of one group --


383
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,193 line:-1
people who are blind
or low vision?


384
00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.795 line:-1 position:50%
Well, people who are blind
or low vision


385
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,198 line:-1
have all sorts
of gender identities.


386
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,432 line:-1
In other words,


387
00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:15.568 line:-1 position:50%
these characteristics
will work together


388
00:17:15.568 --> 00:17:18.170 line:-1 position:50%
to impact the experiences
people have


389
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,040 line:-1
while reading
image descriptions.


390
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,875 line:-1
Intersectionality was developed


391
00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:26.579 line:-1 position:50%
by legal and critical race
scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw.


392
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.915 line:-1 position:50%
It recognizes
the unique experiences


393
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,951 line:-1
and needs of people
who have multiple identities


394
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,353 line:-1
which are systematically
disadvantaged.


395
00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:38.157 line:-1 position:50%
In this example, listening
to intersectional perspectives


396
00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:41.394 line:-1 position:50%
helped us to develop
great experiences


397
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,163 line:-1
for people with identities
across groups


398
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,232 line:-1
in the diversity axes.


399
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,835 line:-1
Specifically, intersectionality
helped us listen to people


400
00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:53.039 line:-1 position:50%
tell us how being both blind
or low vision


401
00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:57.343 line:-1 position:50%
and being a minority gender,
like non-binary and transgender,


402
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,545 line:-1
together impacted
their experiences


403
00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:02.048 line:-1 position:50%
reading image descriptions.


404
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,383 line:-1
To ensure that we learned
perspectives


405
00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:08.187 line:-1 position:50%
from people who live at
this very specific intersection,


406
00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:11.557 line:-1 position:50%
our team partnered
with outside organizations


407
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,593 line:-1
with members who are both
blind or low vision


408
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,264 line:-1
and who are part
of the LGBTQ+ community,


409
00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:22.368 line:-1 position:50%
which is inclusive of non-binary
and transgender people.


410
00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:25.137 line:-1 position:50%
Our team learned that you can’t
know someone’s gender


411
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,039 line:-1
by looking at a photo.


412
00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.040 line:-1 position:50%
We also learned


413
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.276 line:-1 position:50%
that gender-neutral
image descriptions


414
00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:33.079 line:-1 position:50%
could still provide
helpful details


415
00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:35.114 line:-1 position:50%
by focusing on other things,


416
00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:38.017 line:-1 position:50%
such as people’s clothes
and hairstyles.


417
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:42,555 line:-1
For now, we developed VoiceOver
Recognition image descriptions


418
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,390 line:-1
to be gender neutral.


419
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,425 line:-1
As an example, let’s hear


420
00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:50.329 line:-1 position:50%
the VoiceOver Recognition image
description of this photo.


421
00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:51.931 line:-1 position:50%
>> VoiceOver: A person
with curly black hair


422
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:53.766 line:-1 position:50%
wearing a red and white
striped shirt


423
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,902 line:-1
and standing in front
of a building.


424
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:00,306 line:-1
However, anyone can use
the description feature


425
00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.708 line:-1 position:50%
to write their own
image descriptions,


426
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,011 line:-1
which can include
people’s gender


427
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:07.113 line:-1 position:50%
when the person writing
the image description


428
00:19:07.113 --> 00:19:08.981 line:-1 position:50%
knows this information.


429
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:13.552 line:-1 position:50%
A human-written description
for the same photo could be,


430
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,955 line:-1
“Sam stands outside
of a restaurant.


431
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,423 line:-1
She has curly black hair


432
00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:20.693 line:-1 position:50%
and wears a red and white
striped blazer.”


433
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:24,930 line:-1
So we just looked at the process
of inclusive development


434
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.767 line:-1 position:50%
as it applied
to using machine learning.


435
00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:31.904 line:-1 position:50%
But the things I talked about
apply to any app or game.


436
00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:36.275 line:-1 position:50%
First, inclusion is innovation
for wider audiences.


437
00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:37.743 line:-1 position:50%
For example,


438
00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:41.280 line:-1 position:50%
image descriptions enhance
engagement for everyone


439
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.849 line:-1 position:50%
by allowing people
who are blind or low vision


440
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,318 line:-1
to take part in all of the fun
we have


441
00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:48.888 line:-1 position:50%
by sharing photos
with one another.


442
00:19:48.888 --> 00:19:51.023 line:-1 position:50%
Even if you don’t have
the resources


443
00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:54.427 line:-1 position:50%
to train machine learning models
to increase accessibility,


444
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,329 line:-1
you can still create
great experiences


445
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,599 line:-1
with features that enable people
to be more inclusive,


446
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,669 line:-1
like our description feature.


447
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,373 line:-1
Second, including people
who live at the intersection


448
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,309 line:-1
of various identities
and experiences


449
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,246 line:-1
helps you to not just develop
for one group at a time,


450
00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:18.617 line:-1 position:50%
but to make sure your products
intended to meet unique needs,


451
00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:21.654 line:-1 position:50%
like those of people
who are blind or low vision,


452
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:25,324 line:-1
are also respectful
across diversity axes,


453
00:20:25.324 --> 00:20:28.227 line:-1 position:50%
which we did by developing
image descriptions


454
00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.830 line:-1 position:50%
that are inclusive
of all genders.


455
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,200 line:-1
Our team learned about
this important intersection


456
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.570 line:-1 position:50%
by researching how machine
learning represented people.


457
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,939 line:-1
And this is something
anyone can do,


458
00:20:39.939 --> 00:20:44.143 line:-1 position:50%
whether you're working on
your own or at a large company.


459
00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:48.314 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, reaching out to experts
when we did not know something,


460
00:20:48.314 --> 00:20:52.618 line:-1 position:50%
was a key component
of our inclusive process.


461
00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:53.919 line:-1 position:50%
Caroline: As Cynthia discussed,


462
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,822 line:-1
focusing in on intersections
of diversity axes


463
00:20:56.822 --> 00:21:01.393 line:-1 position:50%
is one way to not only
be innovative, but respectful.


464
00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:03.829 line:-1 position:50%
To continue discussing
tips for inclusivity


465
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,931 line:-1
in the design and development
process,


466
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,602 line:-1
the next phase is
when you test your app or game.


467
00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:13.172 line:-1 position:50%
We need to seek out and engage
with a diverse group of people


468
00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:16.742 line:-1 position:50%
to use your app or game
to give real-life feedback.


469
00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:19.979 line:-1 position:50%
Most of all, you’ll discover
whether the ideas in your mind


470
00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:22.281 line:-1 position:50%
hold up in practice
and over time,


471
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:25.151 line:-1 position:50%
as well as gain extra insights.


472
00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:27.419 line:-1 position:50%
Having testing teams
with diverse backgrounds


473
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,455 line:-1
can help find those edge cases.


474
00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:32.525 line:-1 position:50%
Diversity will bring
a wider range of experiences


475
00:21:32.525 --> 00:21:34.793 line:-1 position:50%
and usability patterns.


476
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,363 line:-1
Next, testing
with assistive technologies


477
00:21:37.363 --> 00:21:40.332 line:-1 position:50%
and various accommodations
will help you uncover issues


478
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,501 line:-1
before they affect customers.


479
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,436 line:-1
Learning the basics
of VoiceOver,


480
00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:47.006 line:-1 position:50%
increasing your text size
to the maximum level,


481
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,542 line:-1
or navigating your app
or game with the keyboard


482
00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:52.478 line:-1 position:50%
can help you quickly identify
potential problems


483
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,114 line:-1
and should be incorporated
into test plans.


484
00:21:55.114 --> 00:21:58.684 line:-1 position:50%
Next, listen, review,
and prioritize feedback.


485
00:21:58.684 --> 00:22:01.487 line:-1 position:50%
Feedback is important
to the final product.


486
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,789 line:-1
With feedback, you may need
to repeat the design


487
00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:06.659 line:-1 position:50%
and development process
with new lenses,


488
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,595 line:-1
remove features,
or add features.


489
00:22:09.595 --> 00:22:12.698 line:-1 position:50%
Advocate in your company
to put inclusive testing goals


490
00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:15.834 line:-1 position:50%
as Key Performance Indicators,
or KPIs,


491
00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:17.369 line:-1 position:50%
just like any other metric,


492
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,941 line:-1
to measure inclusion
as a key business objective.


493
00:22:21.941 --> 00:22:24.410 line:-1 position:50%
The last phase of the design
and development process


494
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,279 line:-1
is deciding if you are ready
to release.


495
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,149 line:-1
At some point,
given time and resources,


496
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:32.218 line:-1 position:50%
you will need to make
tradeoffs to release


497
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,253 line:-1
if you have a hard date.


498
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:36,822 line:-1
It may mean you need
to make hard calls


499
00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:39.291 line:-1 position:50%
by cutting back
the release of one feature


500
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,295 line:-1
so you can make fewer features
great for everyone.


501
00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:45.998 line:-1 position:50%
Poor experiences for a
particular group of people


502
00:22:45.998 --> 00:22:48.834 line:-1 position:50%
can have severe impact
if it continually happens


503
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,236 line:-1
over and over.


504
00:22:50.236 --> 00:22:53.038 line:-1 position:50%
It can lead them away
from your app or game.


505
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,207 line:-1
Next, if you can’t have
the best experience


506
00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:58.410 line:-1 position:50%
for one of your diversity axes
or intersections,


507
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,413 line:-1
you need to take time
to know why, how, and when


508
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,383 line:-1
you can plan
to make the best experience.


509
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,552 line:-1
Sometimes not enough time
was allotted,


510
00:23:06.552 --> 00:23:09.521 line:-1 position:50%
an issue was identified
or escalated too late,


511
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,624 line:-1
didn’t plan
for additional complexity,


512
00:23:11.624 --> 00:23:15.060 line:-1 position:50%
or perhaps the API was novel
and you ran out of time.


513
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.030 line:-1 position:50%
But having an informed
and properly scoped plan


514
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.766 line:-1 position:50%
and target date to address
improvements is important


515
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:24,370 line:-1
to stay on track and to be able
to plan better next time.


516
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,273 line:-1
Learning how to do better
and how we can do more


517
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:30,109 line:-1
is part
of the inclusive journey.


518
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,245 line:-1
You can also remember
to continue to reevaluate,


519
00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:36.315 line:-1 position:50%
strengthen, and grow
with real-life developments,


520
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,183 line:-1
or as you learn more
about the ways


521
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,919 line:-1
you can make the experience
better for people.


522
00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:45.391 line:-1 position:50%
It also means not just moving on
to the next thing entirely.


523
00:23:45.391 --> 00:23:48.894 line:-1 position:50%
Inclusivity allows you to act
towards massive change.


524
00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:52.164 line:-1 position:50%
To walk us through an example
of continuing to iterate designs


525
00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:53.666 line:-1 position:50%
to be more inclusive,


526
00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:56.502 line:-1 position:50%
I’ll hand it over to Sabrine.


527
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,370 line:-1
Sabrine Rekik:
Hello, I'm Sabrine Rekik,


528
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.473 line:-1 position:50%
an inclusion engineer
in the Camera & Photos team.


529
00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:04.310 line:-1 position:50%
My multicultural upbringing
taught me that empathy


530
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,080 line:-1
and curiosity make the world
a better place.


531
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,915 line:-1
I will share insights
and techniques


532
00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:12.151 line:-1 position:50%
on how to continue
your inclusivity journey


533
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,119 line:-1
after you launch.


534
00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:17.823 line:-1 position:50%
To do so, I will use the example
of a feature I worked on,


535
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,192 line:-1
called photo Memories.


536
00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:21.860 line:-1 position:50%
In case you are not familiar
with it,


537
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,130 line:-1
photo Memories smartly stitches
people's photos and videos


538
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,466 line:-1
into heartfelt thematic movies


539
00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:31.070 line:-1 position:50%
and help them revisit
forgotten moments.


540
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.207 line:-1 position:50%
In iOS 15, we wanted to expand
the photo Memories experience


541
00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:38.544 line:-1 position:50%
to be even more inclusive
to our global audience.


542
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,446 line:-1
To guide us,
we paid close attention


543
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:44,450 line:-1
to the feedback shared by people
using the Photos app.


544
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,119 line:-1
Many people said they enjoy
photo Memories


545
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,190 line:-1
and being reminded of good times
with family and friends,


546
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,694 line:-1
but others hinted at ways
Memories could be improved.


547
00:24:55.694 --> 00:24:58.630 line:-1 position:50%
I will show you two pieces
of feedback we received,


548
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.167 line:-1 position:50%
and how we turned them
into inclusion goals.


549
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,503 line:-1
The first comment is,


550
00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:08.407 line:-1 position:50%
"I take a lot of photos at
my daughter’s karate practice.


551
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:12,077 line:-1
It would be great to have them
turned into a Memory.”


552
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:16,415 line:-1
We turned this feedback
into the following goal:


553
00:25:16.415 --> 00:25:18.717 line:-1 position:50%
celebrate diversity.


554
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,987 line:-1
How? By surfacing memories
people care about,


555
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,457 line:-1
with themes that match who
they are and what they are into.


556
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,892 line:-1
To come up with those themes,


557
00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:29.762 line:-1 position:50%
we organized brainstorming
sessions with our teammates


558
00:25:29.762 --> 00:25:31.230 line:-1 position:50%
throughout the company,


559
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,333 line:-1
especially those
living outside of the US.


560
00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:36.735 line:-1 position:50%
Brainstorming is
my favorite group technique


561
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,471 line:-1
to quickly and spontaneously
generate ideas


562
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,741 line:-1
and boost creativity.


563
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,111 line:-1
We gathered unique ideas
to make Memories more personal;


564
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:50,716 line:-1
many of them we would not have
thought of by ourselves.


565
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:51,784 line:-1
We were reminded


566
00:25:51.784 --> 00:25:54.653 line:-1 position:50%
that even though many of us
love taking photographs,


567
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,355 line:-1
the content
of our photo libraries


568
00:25:56.355 --> 00:25:58.190 line:-1 position:50%
is unique to each of us.


569
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:02.895 line:-1 position:50%
Our photos and videos reflect
our own identity and life story,


570
00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:06.965 line:-1 position:50%
including our hobbies
and cultural heritage.


571
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,802 line:-1
To help people relive
moments they care about,


572
00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:10.836 line:-1 position:50%
we had to embrace


573
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:14,940 line:-1
the breadth of life experiences
and interests.


574
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,009 line:-1
Little tip for
your brainstorming session:


575
00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:20.512 line:-1 position:50%
identify voices that are very
different from yours.


576
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,982 line:-1
And if possible, run multiple
sessions with smaller groups


577
00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:25.083 line:-1 position:50%
in different time zones


578
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,719 line:-1
to allow more people
to participate.


579
00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:29.788 line:-1 position:50%
Large groups tend
to be intimidating,


580
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,858 line:-1
and you can miss out
on great suggestions.


581
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,793 line:-1
Once we gathered
new memories ideas,


582
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,195 line:-1
we analyzed each one


583
00:26:36.195 --> 00:26:38.897 line:-1 position:50%
through the lenses
of the diversity axes.


584
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,567 line:0
In our case, we looked
at new Memory themes


585
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:45,170 position:50%
through the lenses of:
rural versus urban living,


586
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,741 position:50%
teenagers versus grandparents,
regional versus global.


587
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,578 line:-1
And for each of them,
we answered the questions:


588
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,747 line:-1
Who are we building this for?
Who are excluding?


589
00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:57.816 line:-1 position:50%
And how will people feel?


590
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,518 line:-1
This exercise helped us select


591
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,687 line:-1
and prioritize
new Memory themes.


592
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:04,490 line:-1
People wanted more
of their hobbies to be included,


593
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,825 line:-1
so we started
representing more of them


594
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:11,196 line:-1
such as martial arts,
skateboarding, and soccer.


595
00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:13.765 line:-1 position:50%
We chose to prioritize hobbies
around the world,


596
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:17,302 line:-1
rather than hobbies
in our areas.


597
00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:20.038 line:-1 position:50%
But we didn't stop there,
we also expanded


598
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,174 line:-1
our international holiday
catalogue


599
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:25,677 line:-1
so every person can relive
festivities they cherish,


600
00:27:25.677 --> 00:27:30.482 line:-1 position:50%
whether it be Christmas, Diwali,
Lunar New Year, Eïd al-Fitr,


601
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,685 line:-1
Hanukkah, or all of them.


602
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,088 line:-1
Since my team didn't have
the expertise required,


603
00:27:36.088 --> 00:27:38.490 line:-1 position:50%
we collaborated
with cultural experts


604
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,261 line:-1
to identify the set of holidays
people living in their regions


605
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,029 line:-1
love celebrating.


606
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,664 line:-1
I'm thrilled that the Photos app


607
00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:49.268 line:-1 position:50%
can help me revisit
even more aspects of my life,


608
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:54,573 line:-1
including my favorite Tunisian,
French, and American holidays.


609
00:27:54.573 --> 00:27:57.109 line:-1 position:50%
Now let’s look at the second
feedback we heard.


610
00:27:57.109 --> 00:27:59.645 line:-1 position:50%
Someone commented,
“I don’t like when


611
00:27:59.645 --> 00:28:04.182 line:-1 position:50%
the Photos app reminds me
of my ex-partner.”


612
00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:07.252 line:-1 position:50%
We turned in
into the following goal:


613
00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:09.888 line:-1 position:50%
Being mindful of difficult
life experiences,


614
00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:12.591 line:-1 position:50%
and design with sensitivity.


615
00:28:12.591 --> 00:28:16.695 line:-1 position:50%
To achieve this objective,
we used another technique.


616
00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:19.798 line:-1 position:50%
While brainstorming meetings
are great at producing ideas


617
00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:21.733 line:-1 position:50%
and increasing creativity,


618
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,903 line:-1
specific topics require
extra sensitivity


619
00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:27.439 line:-1 position:50%
and your undivided attention.


620
00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:29.908 line:-1 position:50%
So we leaned towards
individual interviews


621
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,044 line:-1
to dive deeper
and provide a safe space


622
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,379 line:-1
for people to share
their stories.


623
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,349 line:-1
I encourage you to give it a try
and schedule conversations


624
00:28:37.349 --> 00:28:39.484 line:-1 position:50%
with people who had concerns
with your app


625
00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:41.219 line:-1 position:50%
and didn't feel included.


626
00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:43.755 line:-1 position:50%
For Memories,
we hosted several conversations


627
00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:48.327 line:-1 position:50%
to unpack the feedback gathered
during our preliminary research.


628
00:28:48.327 --> 00:28:51.863 line:-1 position:50%
Several people shared that they
enjoyed revisiting their photos,


629
00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:54.066 line:-1 position:50%
except when they featured
a person


630
00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:56.435 line:-1 position:50%
they'd rather not
be reminded of.


631
00:28:56.435 --> 00:28:59.871 line:-1 position:50%
Before designing solutions,
we carved space to empathize,


632
00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:03.175 line:-1 position:50%
listen, and understand
their perspectives.


633
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:06,445 line:-1
We gently unpacked the what,
how, when,


634
00:29:06.445 --> 00:29:08.714 line:-1 position:50%
and especially the why.


635
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:13,185 line:-1
We were interested in what made
a memory enjoyable or not,


636
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:15,887 line:-1
but this question
is difficult to answer.


637
00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:20.192 line:-1 position:50%
To avoid vague and generic
replies, we asked instead:


638
00:29:20.192 --> 00:29:23.195 line:-1 position:50%
What are some
of your favorite Memories?


639
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:26,331 line:-1
What Memories did you dislike?


640
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,935 line:-1
What were you feeling
after seeing it?


641
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:33,472 line:-1
How can we make the experience
better for you?


642
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,641 line:-1
And followed up with things
like, “Why?"


643
00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:37.142 line:-1 position:50%
or "Tell me more about that..."


644
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,878 line:-1
to unpack the answers
even further.


645
00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:42.848 line:-1 position:50%
Formulating the right questions
can be challenging,


646
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:45,484 line:-1
but it’s a skill
you get better at with practice.


647
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:48,286 line:-1
If you can,
favor open-ended questions,


648
00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:50.555 line:-1 position:50%
refer to specific moments
in the past


649
00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:54.026 line:-1 position:50%
and avoid using language
that can influence the response.


650
00:29:54.026 --> 00:29:56.795 line:-1 position:50%
Also restrain from bringing
solutions to their problems


651
00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:58.897 line:-1 position:50%
just yet, and take things in.


652
00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:01.433 line:-1 position:50%
By having one-on-one
conversations,


653
00:30:01.433 --> 00:30:04.536 line:-1 position:50%
we were reminded that photos
and videos have the power


654
00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:09.941 line:-1 position:50%
to affect someone's emotions,
both positively and negatively.


655
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,678 line:-1
It can be difficult
to unexpectedly see photos


656
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,546 line:-1
of a loved one who passed away


657
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,282 line:-1
and be reminded
of their absence.


658
00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:19.685 line:-1 position:50%
For others, pictures
of their ex-partner


659
00:30:19.685 --> 00:30:24.022 line:-1 position:50%
can elicit a myriad of emotions,
from sadness to anger.


660
00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:25.757 line:-1 position:50%
And we also learned
that sometimes,


661
00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:28.060 line:-1 position:50%
it's not what is in
the frame that hurts,


662
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,528 line:-1
but the invisible context


663
00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:33.331 line:-1 position:50%
that only the owner of
the photo library knows about.


664
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,633 line:-1
The process of listening


665
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:38,370 line:-1
and absorbing other people's
experiences can be humbling.


666
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,639 line:-1
It was for me and my team.


667
00:30:40.639 --> 00:30:42.774 line:-1 position:50%
After being immersed
in real stories,


668
00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:46.678 line:-1 position:50%
it is now time to address
the feedback with a new design.


669
00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:49.548 line:-1 position:50%
In our case, to help people
revisit photos and videos


670
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:50,982 line:-1
that bring joy,


671
00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:53.552 line:-1 position:50%
we thought we'd give them
control over who they see,


672
00:30:53.552 --> 00:30:55.887 line:-1 position:50%
or not,
in Memories.


673
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,890 line:-1
In the first iteration,
we added multiple buttons


674
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.027 line:-1 position:50%
to feature less of a person
while browsing a Memory,


675
00:31:02.027 --> 00:31:03.962 line:-1 position:50%
and we reengineered
our app,


676
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,231 line:-1
so they’ll immediately
see less of these people


677
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,367 line:-1
across the Photos app.


678
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,437 line:-1
For consistency, we looked
at other places in our app


679
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,407 line:-1
where people would want
to affect the experience.


680
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:18,710 line:-1
We added a Feature Less
action from a Featured photo,


681
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.378 line:-1 position:50%
from the People albums,


682
00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:24.316 line:-1 position:50%
and even from a single asset
while browsing.


683
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,051 line:-1
The next step is to validate


684
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:29.020 line:-1 position:50%
that a solution
to a problem works.


685
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.922 line:-1 position:50%
As designers and developers,


686
00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:33.792 line:-1 position:50%
the first design we come up with
is our first response


687
00:31:33.792 --> 00:31:36.862 line:-1 position:50%
to the stories we heard
and absorbed.


688
00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:39.064 line:-1 position:50%
However, listening to someone


689
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,399 line:-1
doesn't always mean
we understood them.


690
00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:43.401 line:-1 position:50%
To make sure
you are on the right track


691
00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:44.603 line:-1 position:50%
and solve real problems,


692
00:31:44.603 --> 00:31:48.006 line:-1 position:50%
it is important to circle back
to the people you interviewed,


693
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,776 line:-1
show them your sketches,
and seek their feedback.


694
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,677 line:-1
Is your design
addressing their need?


695
00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:53.712 line:-1 position:50%
And if not,


696
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:57,382 line:-1
try to understand the nuances
you missed the first time.


697
00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:59.451 line:-1 position:50%
When we showed
our first solution to people,


698
00:31:59.451 --> 00:32:01.486 line:-1 position:50%
we got mixed reactions.


699
00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:05.190 line:-1 position:50%
We learned that we all have
different tolerance thresholds


700
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.893 line:-1 position:50%
and that the action
of featuring less of a person


701
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:10,662 line:-1
wasn't radical enough for some.


702
00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:12.831 line:-1 position:50%
We took this insight
into account,


703
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,800 line:-1
and in the following
design iteration,


704
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,270 line:-1
left it up to each person
to decide what they would like:


705
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,973 line:-1
feature a person less,
or never feature it again.


706
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,643 line:-1
It might feel evident
in hindsight.


707
00:32:24.643 --> 00:32:27.212 line:-1 position:50%
However, it happens
to all of us.


708
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,147 line:-1
When we get too close
to our products,


709
00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:33.251 line:-1 position:50%
we develop oversights and fail
at meeting people's needs.


710
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:36.555 line:-1 position:50%
But empathizing with people
can help us course correct


711
00:32:36.555 --> 00:32:39.724 line:-1 position:50%
when we didn't get things
right from the first try.


712
00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:43.328 line:-1 position:50%
Lastly, even details
like glyphs and icons


713
00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:45.931 line:-1 position:50%
can have an impact on people.


714
00:32:45.931 --> 00:32:48.200 line:-1 position:50%
During the final phases
of development,


715
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.535 line:-1 position:50%
we observed that
the thumbs down icon


716
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:54,206 line:-1
could project a feeling
of disliking the person.


717
00:32:54.206 --> 00:32:56.608 line:-1 position:50%
This might be the case
in some situations


718
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,776 line:-1
but not for others,


719
00:32:57.776 --> 00:33:00.612 line:-1 position:50%
like when a loved one
has passed away.


720
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:05,650 line:-1
So we decided to use
a more neutral glyph instead.


721
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.720 line:-1 position:50%
So, we just saw through
the example of photo Memories


722
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.289 line:-1 position:50%
that launching a product
is not an end,


723
00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:12.691 line:-1 position:50%
it is a new beginning


724
00:33:12.691 --> 00:33:16.261 line:-1 position:50%
in your design and
development journey.


725
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,662 line:-1
By having inclusion in mind,


726
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,266 line:-1
you will continue to make your
experience better for everyone.


727
00:33:21.266 --> 00:33:25.003 line:-1 position:50%
Remember to first,
look at reviews and feedback


728
00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:28.106 line:-1 position:50%
people using your app or game
left on the Internet,


729
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,709 line:-1
and go the extra mile
to seek feedback from people


730
00:33:30.709 --> 00:33:34.346 line:-1 position:50%
with experiences different
from yours and your friends.


731
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,214 line:-1
Second, empathize


732
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,717 line:-1
and put yourself
in other people's shoes


733
00:33:38.717 --> 00:33:41.186 line:-1 position:50%
by using the many techniques
at your disposal


734
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,788 line:-1
like brainstorming,
working with experts,


735
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,857 line:-1
and individual interviews.


736
00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:47.559 line:-1 position:50%
And finally,
address the feedback


737
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:51,263 line:-1
even when it’s not your own
experience with the product.


738
00:33:51.263 --> 00:33:54.399 line:-1 position:50%
And remember that sharing back
solutions for validation


739
00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.200 line:-1 position:50%
can help ensure


740
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.471 line:-1 position:50%
the experience has actually made
a more positive impact.


741
00:33:59.471 --> 00:34:01.773 line:-1 position:50%
Now back to Caroline.


742
00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:03.575 line:-1 position:50%
Caroline: We hope
the diversity axes


743
00:34:03.575 --> 00:34:06.478 line:-1 position:50%
and the examples we have
shown you today are useful


744
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,881 line:-1
as you tailor an inclusive
design and development process


745
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,217 line:-1
that fits your company
and context.


746
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:15,453 line:-1
To conclude,
inclusion is a journey.


747
00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:17.589 line:-1 position:50%
Yes, the journey
is sometimes hard,


748
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:19.991 line:-1 position:50%
but we love solving
hard problems, right?


749
00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:22.794 line:-1 position:50%
Difficulties should only
drive us to try harder


750
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,897 line:-1
to make our apps and games
more inclusive.


751
00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.766 line:-1 position:50%
Inclusive design and development


752
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,235 line:-1
stimulates new,
creative solutions.


753
00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:33.505 line:-1 position:50%
Inclusion does not deliver
subpar experiences,


754
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,807 line:-1
but instead opens up
opportunities


755
00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:38.543 line:-1 position:50%
in areas we may have never
considered,


756
00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:41.846 line:-1 position:50%
and offers productive
constraints to narrow our scope


757
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,649 line:-1
and design with more intention.


758
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,254 line:-1
Empowered diverse teams can
deliver more inclusive products.


759
00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:51.723 line:-1 position:50%
Diverse representation
does not guarantee


760
00:34:51.723 --> 00:34:53.959 line:-1 position:50%
inclusivity will come naturally.


761
00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:57.028 line:-1 position:50%
Instead, when people are invited
to share their perspectives,


762
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,931 line:-1
and when perspectives together
impact decisions,


763
00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:02.834 line:-1 position:50%
products can be more inclusive.


764
00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:07.472 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, inclusion must be
infused into the entire design


765
00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:11.309 line:-1 position:50%
and development process --
into empathizing, ideation,


766
00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:16.014 line:-1 position:50%
designing, development,
testing, release, and beyond.


767
00:35:16.014 --> 00:35:18.717 line:-1 position:50%
The examples we shared
demonstrate that inclusion


768
00:35:18.717 --> 00:35:22.854 line:-1 position:50%
is as much of a process as
design and development are,


769
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,723 line:-1
and the resulting
features are better


770
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:28,493 line:-1
because of the attention
given to inclusion.


771
00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:31.062 line:-1 position:50%
Listening to the lived
experiences of people


772
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,332 line:-1
will help you to understand
the impact of your app or game,


773
00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:37.602 line:-1 position:50%
and to release both innovative
and respectful products


774
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:38,670 line:-1
in response.


775
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,040 line:-1
Keep the diversity axes
and their intersections in mind


776
00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.576 line:-1 position:50%
as you choose
who to focus on.


777
00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:46.011 line:-1 position:50%
We can practice empathy


778
00:35:46.011 --> 00:35:49.247 line:-1 position:50%
and know that inclusive design
is the right thing to do,


779
00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:52.417 line:-1 position:50%
but it’s time to just call this
"good design."


780
00:35:52.417 --> 00:35:54.886 line:-1 position:50%
We can authentically connect
with our audiences


781
00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:56.955 line:-1 position:50%
and learn new perspectives.


782
00:35:56.955 --> 00:35:58.723 line:-1 position:50%
We can handle feedback
