I really, really loved math.

to become an aerospace engineer,


13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.904 line:-2
and ever since that moment,
I've been stuck on that dream.


14
00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:38.639 line:-1
My name is Tiera Fletcher.


15
00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:42.109 line:-2
I'm a rocket scientist working
on NASA's Space Launch System,


16
00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.411 line:-2
and I'm working
to get us to Mars.


17
00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.881 line:-2
I was born and raised
in a small town


18
00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:50.851 line:-2
outside of Atlanta
called Mableton, Georgia.


19
00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.220 line:-2
Fortunately, I grew up
with both of my parents


20
00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.455 line:-1
and two older siblings.


21
00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.526 line:-2
My father, he was a construction
worker, and he would show me


22
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.897 line:-2
how to take measurements or how
to build small-scale houses.


23
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.265 line:-1
And he didn't realize it,


24
00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.368 line:-2
but he was
introducing me to engineering.


25
00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.837 line:-1
And my mom, when we would go


26
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.506 line:-2
to the grocery store,
she would challenge me


27
00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.475 line:-2
to calculate the total
of the groceries,

without a calculator.


30
00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.517 line:-2
So she did those exercises
because she understood


31
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.420 line:-2
that I had a passion
for mathematics.


32
00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:30.624 line:-2
So at the age of 11, I decided
to become an aerospace engineer.


33
00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:34.928 line:-2
I joined a program that
taught students about robotics.


34
00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:38.765 line:-2
So being able to design
and build was already a passion


35
00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.236 line:-2
that I had acquired prior
to the program, but being able


36
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:48.342 line:-2
to program that structure
that I create and make it move,


37
00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.845 line:-2

all to life for me, literally.


38
00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:54.248 line:-2
Being able to see
something go from paper

put it all together for me.


40
00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:02.489 line:-2
To continue towards my dream,
I decided to attend


41
00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:05.125 line:-2
the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.


42
00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.995 line:-2
While at MIT,
I had the opportunity


43
00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:12.032 line:-2
to define antigravity
rotations for astronauts.


44
00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:15.369 line:-2
And I also had the opportunity
to define


45
00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:20.107 line:-2
the outer protective layer for

46
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.109 line:-1
Since our very first breath,


47
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.779 line:-2
humankind has just had
this passion to explore

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:30.284 line:-2
and discover the unknown,
to determine the new frontiers.


49
00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:32.786 line:-1
And really that hunger

to produce
all of this innovation


51
00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:39.326 line:-2

to global positioning systems

or, as you know it,
GPS, and even the Internet.


55
00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.340 line:-2
But even before
all of those innovations,


56
00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:57.211 line:-2
we've had the passion
to go to Mars.


57
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.783 line:-1
Sending 24 humans into space,


58
00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:08.188 line:-2
completing 13 launches,
weighing over 6 million pounds


59
00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:10.858 line:-2
and standing taller
than the Statue of Liberty


60
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:12.960 line:-1
was the Saturn V,


61
00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:16.430 line:-2
the largest rocket
ever created in history.


62
00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:19.867 line:-2
Some may even argue
that the Saturn V was created


63
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.102 line:-1
to take humanity to Mars.


64
00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:28.041 line:-2
So from 1969 to 1973,
the Saturn V served


65
00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:30.911 line:-2
as the launcher
for the Apollo program.


66
00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:33.247 line:-1
So it was literally facilitating


67
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.149 line:-1
human footprints to the Moon.


68
00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:38.085 line:-1
This rocket did not merely just


69
00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:39.453 line:-1
launch into the air and break


70
00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:40.988 line:-1
through the atmosphere.


71
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:44.391 line:-2
It was controlled
by groundbreaking avionics


72
00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:46.894 line:-1
of the time and notably


73
00:03:46.927 --> 00:03:50.097 line:-2
the Launch Vehicle
Digital Computer.


74
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.468 line:-2
With increased computer use
on board, it caused an increase


75
00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:56.737 line:-2
of computer use
off board as well.


76
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.474 line:-2
So thankfully,
software-enabled processes


77
00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:03.777 line:-2
caused our manual processes
to then become


78
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.479 line:-1
completely automated.


79
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,550

113
00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:05.532 line:-2

including Mars.


116
00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:17.845 line:-2
And we have a vehicle
to propel us there:


117
00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.880 line:-1
NASA Space Launch System.


118
00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:24.685 line:-2
I began working
on the Space Launch System


119
00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.788 line:-2
program at the age of 22
as a structural design


120
00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:30.757 line:-2
and analysis engineer,
and what that means is that


121
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.093 line:-2
I would design
different parts of the rocket


122
00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:37.264 line:-2
and verify the structural
integrity of those same parts.


123
00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:41.635 line:-2
And then I wanted to see
the rocket, so I decided to go


124
00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:43.337 line:-1
to the Michoud Assembly Facility


125
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.806 line:-2
in New Orleans,
Louisiana, and I worked


126
00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.008 line:-1
as an engine section task lead.


127
00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:51.612 line:-2
So those same parts that I just
designed, I had to spearhead


128
00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:54.314 line:-2
the installation of those parts
and work with the technicians


129
00:06:54.348 --> 00:06:57.885 line:-2
to verify that all
of the assemblies were correct.


130
00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:01.054 line:-2
Moving on from there,
I became a structural engineer,


131
00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:04.491 line:-2
and what that means is that
my role was very multifaceted.


132
00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:07.594 line:-2

that the rocket was complete.


136
00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:19.239 line:-2
And then I became fully
a structural design engineer,


137
00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:23.076 line:-2
where I had to create
drawings and verify


138
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.981 line:-2
all of the different intricacies
of the designs for the vehicle.


139
00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:30.784 line:-2
And now I'm
a configuration management

integration engineer,


141

or you can say
a product life cycle engineer.


142
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.092 line:-2
What that means is
that I have to verify


143
00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:42.596 line:-2
that all of the engineering
designs for the parts align


144
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.798 line:-2

00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:07.614 line:-2
is the most powerful rocket
ever created in history.


169
00:09:07.648 --> 00:09:10.884 line:-2
Producing over 8 million pounds
of thrust,


170
00:09:10.918 --> 00:09:14.755 line:-2
that's actually 15%
more thrust than the Saturn V.


171
00:09:17.324 --> 00:09:19.393 line:-2
Most recently,
the Space Launch System


172
00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:21.962 line:-2
core stage underwent
green run testing.


173
00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:25.098 line:-2
What green run testing
means is that the engines are


174
00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:29.436 line:-2
all fired up at the same time
as a whole structure,


175
00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:32.172 line:-2
and let's just say
that anyone who is near


176
00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:36.109 line:-2
the Stennis Space Center can
feel the rumbling and the growl


177
00:09:36.143 --> 00:09:39.913 line:-2
of the propulsive system
of the Space Launch System.


178
00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:43.584 line:-2
This was a significant test
because we had a chance to have


179
00:09:43.617 --> 00:09:47.688 line:-2
multiple and multiple test cases
play a role all within


180
00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:51.024 line:-2
8 to 9 minutes, so it was
a very short time frame


181
00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:52.893 line:-1
but super monumental


182
00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.762 line:-2
for our process to get
the Space Launch System


183
00:09:55.796 --> 00:09:59.800 line:-2
on the launch stand
at the Kennedy Space Center.


184
00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:02.836 line:-2
The interesting part is
that we had to move this


185
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.307 line:-2
massive structure all the way
from New Orleans, Louisiana,


186
00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:09.076 line:-1
to the Kennedy Space Center.


187
00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.211 line:-1
And that's where the historical


188
00:10:11.245 --> 00:10:13.280 line:-2
Pegasus barge
had to come into play.


189
00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:16.049 line:-2
We were able to load
the core stage


190
00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:19.820 line:-2
and carefully bring it over
to the Kennedy Space Center.


191
00:10:19.853 --> 00:10:22.456 line:-1
Although it can undergo


192
00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:26.426 line:-2
millions of pounds of force,
we want to make sure that


193
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.097 line:-2
the structural integrity is
maintained throughout the whole


194
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.633 line:-1
transportation process.


195
00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:35.135 line:-2
And now we are
stacking up multiple components


196
00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:38.505 line:-2
of the rocket in the vertical
assembly building so that we can


197
00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:40.541 line:-2
then shift it over
to the launch stand


198
00:10:40.574 --> 00:10:44.044 line:-2
so that we can launch
at the end of this year.

200
00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:59.259 line:-2
So now let's talk about
the missions of how we get


201
00:10:59.293 --> 00:11:02.196 line:-1
back to the Moon and on to Mars.


202
00:11:02.229 --> 00:11:04.998 line:-2
This is through
the Artemis program,


203
00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:07.534 line:-2
and it consists
of three different missions.


204
00:11:07.568 --> 00:11:11.171 line:-2
The first mission
takes place this year in 2021.


205
00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.910 line:-2
The Artemis 1
Space Launch System will pair


206
00:11:16.944 --> 00:11:21.748 line:-2
along with the Orion crew
capsule for an uncrewed flight.


207
00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:24.384 line:-2
And the significance
of this flight is that it is


208
00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:26.687 line:-2
the initial flight
for the Space Launch System,


209
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.388 line:-1
so it is a mission that will be


210
00:11:28.422 --> 00:11:30.157 line:-1
proving ground for the structure


211
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.961 line:-2
before we allow astronauts
to come on.


212
00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:38.065 line:-2
And the Orion will travel
40,000 miles away from the Moon,


213
00:11:38.098 --> 00:11:42.336 line:-2
which is about 280,000 miles
away from the Earth's surface.


214
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.972 line:-2
In total,
Orion will undergo about


215
00:11:45.005 --> 00:11:50.377 line:-2
1.4 million miles of travel
from Earth and all the way back.


216
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.847 line:-2
This journey is going to prove
very significant because


217
00:11:53.881 --> 00:11:57.518 line:-2
we are going to be able
to collect data that will fuel


218
00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:00.654 line:-2
the next Artemis mission,
but also it will fuel


219
00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:03.290 line:-2
the whole future
of space travel.


220
00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:04.725 line:-1
Orion is going to undergo


221
00:12:04.758 --> 00:12:09.563 line:-2
an entry at about
24,500 miles per hour.


222
00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:12.299 line:-2
And that's going to cause
the capsule to reach


223
00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:15.802 line:-1
about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.


224
00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:18.906 line:-2
All of the data that we will
collect from this mission


225
00:12:18.939 --> 00:12:20.774 line:-1
will definitely teach us


226
00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:24.511 line:-2
what to do before we allow
astronauts on board.


227
00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:30.417 line:-1
In 2022, the Artemis 2


228
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.187 line:-2
Space Launch System
in conjunction with the Orion


229
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.757 line:-2
will carry four astronauts
back to the lunar environment


230
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:40.827 line:-2
for the first time
in over 50 years.


231
00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:42.763 line:-1
This is extremely significant


232
00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:45.432 line:-2
for the future
of human space travel.


233
00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:48.569 line:-2
The astronauts will undergo
a ten-day mission


234
00:12:48.602 --> 00:12:50.838 line:-2
where the capsule will make
two orbits


235
00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:55.209 line:-2
around the Earth
and then head over to the Moon.


236
00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:58.812 line:-2
The Orion will begin by reaching
an initial insertion orbit.


237
00:12:58.846 --> 00:13:02.583 line:-2
After the first orbit,
the interim cryogenic propulsion


238
00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:06.553 line:-2
stage will then propel Orion
to high-Earth orbit.


239
00:13:06.587 --> 00:13:09.056 line:-2
The Orion will then be
separated from the interim


240
00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:12.793 line:-2
cryogenic propulsion stage
so that the astronauts can


241
00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:17.431 line:-2
verify valuable performance
and operational capabilities


242
00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:20.067 line:-2
so that that data can
carry forward


243
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.336 line:-1
for the next Artemis mission.


244
00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:26.440 line:-2
In 2024,
Artemis 3 Space Launch System


245
00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:32.012 line:-2
and Orion will carry astronauts
back into the space environment.


246
00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:35.082 line:-1
But this time, the first woman


247

on the challenge
of not only contributing


265
00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:40.247 line:-2
