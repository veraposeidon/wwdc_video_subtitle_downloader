Olivia Hillman: Hi,
I'm Olivia Hillman,


7
00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.081 line:-1 position:50%
and I'm a security engineer


8
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,116 line:-1
working on Apple's
Notary service.


9
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,351 line:-1
I'm going to talk to you


10
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.286 line:-1 position:50%
about some exciting
work we've been doing


11
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:23,490 line:-1
to make notarizing Mac apps
faster and simpler.


12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,327 line:-1
I'll start with a brief overview
of what the Notary service is.


13
00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:29.596 line:-1 position:50%
Then I'll dive into our new tool


14
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,532 line:-1
and I'll share how you
can get started using it.


15
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,801 line:-1
So, let's begin!


16
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,137 line:-1
Notarization is
for Mac developers


17
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,474 line:-1
that distribute their software
outside of the App Store,


18
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,043 line:-1
and this talk specifically
is for those of you


19
00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:46.246 line:-1 position:50%
that use the existing
command-line tool, altool


20
00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.181 line:-1 position:50%
to interact with Notary.


21
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.317 line:-1 position:50%
If you're notarizing
with Xcode only,


22
00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:52.252 line:-1 position:50%
your workflow isn't changing.


23
00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.055 line:-1 position:50%
Mac developers submit
their software to be notarized


24
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:59.126 line:-1 position:50%
before it's distributed,
so it can run on a user's Mac.


25
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:02,162 line:-1
This notarization process
gives users confidence


26
00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:04.264 line:-1 position:50%
that software running
on their machines


27
00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:08.335 line:-1 position:50%
has been checked by Apple
for malicious components.


28
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,138 line:-1
Notarization has been helping
to protect customers


29
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,740 line:-1
since macOS 10.14.


30
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,577 line:-1
And now, we've made it
faster and simpler to use.


31
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,379 position:50%
For more background
about Notary,


32
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,917 line:0
check out our in-depth 2019 talk
"All about Notarization".


33
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,453 position:50%
Let's take a look
at the Notary workflow.


34
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,355 position:50%
Developers build their software


35
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,891 position:50%
and send it to us
for notarization.


36
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,393 position:50%
The Notary service
runs automated analysis


37
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,029 position:50%
that scans the software
for malicious content


38
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,699 line:0
and checks for code signing
issues.


39
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,735 line:0
If there are no issues,
Notary publishes a ticket


40
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:46,106 position:50%
to be retrieved by users’ Macs
when they launch the software.


41
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,376 position:50%
And then we return the result
to your developer team.


42
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:53,146 line:-1
We're committed to completing
this process within 15 minutes


43
00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.549 line:-1 position:50%
for 98 percent
of Notary submissions,


44
00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.018 line:-1 position:50%
and most complete in under five.


45
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,321 position:50%
You can then provide your app
for users to download,


46
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,756 position:50%
and macOS checks the software


47
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,058 position:50%
before it can run
on a user's machine.


48
00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.794 line:-1 position:50%
We care about protecting
customers from malware


49
00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:11.298 line:-1 position:50%
and making it easier for
developers to submit to Notary


50
00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:15.268 line:-1 position:50%
and even faster for users
to get access to new software.


51
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,937 line:-1
And with that mission in mind,


52
00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:20.273 line:-1 position:50%
I'm thrilled to share with you
the new way to notarize.


53
00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:23.510 line:-1 position:50%
Introducing notarytool.


54
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,446 line:-1
notarytool provides
a one-line command


55
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,183 line:-1
for submitting your software
and waiting for your result.


56
00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.652 line:-1 position:50%
We've introduced
targeted enhancements


57
00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.989 line:-1 position:50%
focused specifically on
the needs of Mac developers


58
00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.592 line:-1 position:50%
that are notarizing software
independently


59
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:42,062 line:-1
without the need for altool's
App Store support.


60
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:46,433 line:-1
These improvements make
notarization faster and easier,


61
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:50,203 line:-1
all while we continue to protect
customers from malware.


62
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,773 line:-1
Developers depend on
the Notary service,


63
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,942 line:-1
so we want it to be
as reliable as possible


64
00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:59.279 line:-1 position:50%
and available whenever
developers need it.


65
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,948 line:-1
In addition to the changes
to the client software,


66
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,152 line:-1
we've also streamlined
the service.


67
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:09,456 line:-1
In fact, we've built
a new dedicated service backend


68
00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:14.061 line:-1 position:50%
that's focused on reliability
just for Notary.


69
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,997 line:-1
The new service is designed
to bring you improvements


70
00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:19.466 line:-1 position:50%
in end-to-end processing speed,


71
00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:22.202 line:-1 position:50%
and we're excited
for you to try it out.


72
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,372 line:0
We know you may be waiting
as your submission uploads,


73
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,541 position:50%
so we've worked hard
to make upload speed


74
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,244 position:50%
up to four times faster
for most developers.


75
00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:33.447 line:-1 position:50%
To take advantage of these
incredible performance


76
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,382 line:-1
and reliability gains,


77
00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:38.819 line:-1 position:50%
be sure to transition
from altool to notarytool.


78
00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.855 line:-1 position:50%
notarytool is easy to use
and carefully designed


79
00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:44.724 line:-1 position:50%
with your notarization
workflow in mind.


80
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,227 line:-1
We've heard your feedback
and we wanted to improve


81
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:50.430 line:-1 position:50%
the developer interaction
with a simpler client


82
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,200 line:-1
and a single line
to get things done.


83
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,001 line:-1
So let's say I'm a developer


84
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:59.239 line:-1 position:50%
and I've just finished building
the latest bug fix to my app.


85
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.143 line:-1 position:50%
I want to get this published
as soon as possible.


86
00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:05.512 line:-1 position:50%
The quickest way
for me to accomplish this


87
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,848 line:-1
with altool on the command line


88
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,417 line:-1
is with a polling loop,
like this.


89
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,687 line:-1
I first submit my application,
and when that's done,


90
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,256 line:-1
I start to continuously
poll for status


91
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,525 line:-1
until processing is complete.


92
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,261 position:50%
Now, with notarytool,


93
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,730 position:50%
we've added a wait flag
to the client


94
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,565 line:0
that allows you to submit


95
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,567 position:50%
and wait for
your notarization result


96
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,304 line:0
all in one command.


97
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,106 line:-1
As soon as your job completes,


98
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,309 line:-1
the program will display
the results of your submission.


99
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,378 line:-1
Once you receive
your submission result,


100
00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:41.448 line:-1 position:50%
you're only one command away
from viewing your Notary log


101
00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.550 line:-1 position:50%
using the new client.


102
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.819 line:-1 position:50%
You'll be able to view details
about your result


103
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,054 line:-1
directly from notarytool,


104
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,390 line:-1
including any reasons
why your application


105
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.292 line:-1 position:50%
may not be notarized.


106
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.327 line:-1 position:50%
We've also added
a brand-new feature


107
00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:57.264 line:-1 position:50%
that's accessible to you
when you submit to Notary:


108
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,232 line:-1
webhook notifications.


109
00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:02.169 line:-1 position:50%
This feature allows you
to specify a URL


110
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,004 line:-1
for a server callback


111
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,374 line:-1
as soon as we finish
processing your software.


112
00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:10.644 line:-1 position:50%
By specifying a webhook URL
when you submit,


113
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,113 line:-1
you can seamlessly add
notarization


114
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,949 line:-1
into your continuous
integration workflows


115
00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.420 line:-1 position:50%
by automatically retrieving
your result and your Notary log


116
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.622 line:-1 position:50%
when you receive a notification.


117
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,859 line:-1
We can't wait for you to start
using this powerful new tool,


118
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:29,296 line:-1
and we look forward to receiving
your feedback about notarytool


119
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,898 line:-1
and this new
developer experience.


120
00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:33.800 line:-1 position:50%
notarytool is the new client


121
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,835 line:-1
for interacting
with the Notary service


122
00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.405 line:-1 position:50%
and is distributed with Xcode.


123
00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.240 line:-1 position:50%
altool isn't going away,


124
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.877 line:-1 position:50%
but is now deprecated
for use with Notary.


125
00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:47.247 line:-1 position:50%
notarytool makes your workflow
faster and simpler


126
00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:50.750 line:-1 position:50%
with a client that's dedicated
to the Notary service.


127
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,652 line:-1
You'll be able
to find more details


128
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:56,022 line:-1
about the latest features
and performance improvements


129
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:01,528 line:-1
in the documentation linked to
this talk in the coming weeks.


130
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:05.432 line:-1 position:50%
Access to the tool is available
with the latest Xcode build,


131
00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:07.500 line:-1 position:50%
with information
to help you get started


132
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,536 line:-1
in the tool's man pages.


133
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,706 line:-1
So make the switch today
to start distributing software


134
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:17,010 line:-1
more quickly and seamlessly
than ever before.


135
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,211 line:-1
