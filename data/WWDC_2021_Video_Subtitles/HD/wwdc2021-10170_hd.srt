[Shobi] Welcome to the session
"Meet TestFlight on Mac."


4
00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.313 line:-1 align:center
I'm Shobi Vijayakumar,


5
00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.115 line:-1 align:center
TestFlight Engineering Manager.


6
00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:16.984 line:-2 align:center
I'm really excited
to share with you


7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,621 line:-2
about the amazing new
TestFlight features coming soon.


8
00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.489 line:-1 align:center
Introducing this year,


9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,791 line:-2
one of your most
popular request:


10
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,360 line:-1
TestFlight on Mac.


11
00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:29.563 line:-2 align:center
TestFlight lets you distribute
beta builds of your app


12
00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:32.633 line:-2 align:center
to testers and collect
valuable feedback.


13
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:36.270 line:-2 align:center
It's been available
on iOS and tvOS,


14
00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:40.340 line:-2 align:center
and now we are bringing it
to MacOS coming this fall.


15
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:44,645 line:-2
TestFlight on Mac provides
all the same capabilities


16
00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:47.414 line:-1 align:center
you have on iOS and tvOS,


17
00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.550 line:-2 align:center
and it will be available
to download


18
00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.485 line:-1 align:center
on the Mac App Store.


19
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:54,054 line:-1
You can install beta apps,


20
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,989 line:-1
setup automatic updates,


21
00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:57.724 line:-1 align:center
and share feedback.


22
00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:01.461 line:-2 align:center
It supports native Mac apps
and iOS apps


23
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,430 line:-1
on Apple Silicon Mac.


24
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:07.668 line:-2 align:center
First let's take a look
at installing beta apps.


25
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.169 line:-1 align:center
You can recruit testers


26
00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:11.171 line:-1 align:center
by sending an email invite


27
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:13,307 line:-1
or by sharing a public link.


28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,142 line:-1
Once they accept the invite,


29
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,578 line:-2
they become a tester
for your app.


30
00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.914 line:-2 align:center
They can browse through
different builds


31
00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:22.382 line:-1 align:center
grouped by versions


32
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,619 line:-2
to choose
a specific build to test


33
00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.155 line:-2 align:center
and click the install button
to download


34
00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.157 line:-1 align:center
and start testing on Mac.


35
00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:33.293 line:-1 align:center
Once a beta app is installed,


36
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:36,396 line:-2
it can be launched
from TestFlight anytime.


37
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.599 line:-2 align:center
It can also be launched
by all means


38
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,635 line:-2
like Dock, Launchpad,
and Finder.


39
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,806 line:-2
To make it easy
to recognize it as a beta app,


40
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,809 line:-2
we show a yellow dot
next to the app name


41
00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:52.779 line:-1 align:center
in the Dock, in Launchpad,


42
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,782 line:-2
and as a Beta Application
in Finder.


43
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,419 line:-2
Testers can configure
automatic updates


44
00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:01.822 line:-2 align:center
to have
the latest available builds


45
00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:04.324 line:-1 align:center
install automatically.


46
00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:06.393 line:-2 align:center
This will ensure
they are testing


47
00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.563 line:-1 align:center
the latest build of your app.


48
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,432 line:-2
While testing a beta version
of an app,


49
00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:15.569 line:-2 align:center
your testers
can send you feedback


50
00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.504 line:-1 align:center
about issues they experience


51
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,707 line:-2
or make suggestions
for improvements.


52
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:24,178 line:-2
They can send feedback
directly from your app


53
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.413 line:-1 align:center
simply by taking a screenshot,


54
00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.215 line:-1 align:center
attaching it,


55
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,951 line:-2
adding in the comments
to describe the issue,


56
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,586 line:-1
and then submit.


57
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,221 line:-1
You can view this feedback


58
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,989 line:-1
in App Store Connect


59
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,692 line:-2
under the Screenshot Feedback
section.


60
00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.527 line:-1 align:center
If the beta app crashes,


61
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,430 line:-2
then TestFlight automatically
captures the crash logs


62
00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.132 line:-1 align:center
and provides a dialog


63
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.968 line:-2 align:center
for testers to enter
additional comments.


64
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.803 line:-1 align:center
You can download the crash logs


65
00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:51.305 line:-1 align:center
and see the feedback


66
00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:54.608 line:-2 align:center
under App Store Connect
crashes feedback section


67
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,577 line:-1
and in Xcode Organizer.


68
00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.880 line:-2 align:center
So that's a brief overview
of the main features


69
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,515 line:-1
of TestFlight on Mac,


70
00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:02.983 line:-1 align:center
which helps you test the apps


71
00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.585 line:-1 align:center
and collect valuable feedback.


72
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:08,789 line:-2
Now, let's take a look
at how native Mac apps


73
00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:11.558 line:-2 align:center
and iOS apps
on Apple Silicon Mac


74
00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:13.594 line:-1 align:center
can be set up for TestFlight


75
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:17,197 line:-2
followed by improved internal
group management


76
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,501 line:-2
and built-in
Xcode Cloud features.


77
00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.569 line:-1 align:center
OK, let's get into the details


78
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:26,373 line:-2
about distributing
native Mac apps with TestFlight.


79
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,611 line:-2
Native Mac apps
require a provisioning profile


80
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:34,147 line:-2
to be distributed
with TestFlight on Mac.


81
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,783 line:-2
We will create and include
the provisioning profile


82
00:03:36.817 --> 00:03:38.018 line:-1 align:center
for your apps


83
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.289 line:-2 align:center
when you use Xcode
Automatically manage signing.


84
00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.092 line:-2 align:center
If your apps manage
signing manually,


85
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,095 line:-2
you have to add
the profile explicitly.


86
00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:50.697 line:-2 align:center
How to create and upload
a profile manually


87
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,133 line:-2
is documented
in the Developer portal.


88
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.703 line:-2 align:center
Once uploaded
with a provisioning profile,


89
00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:59.406 line:-2 align:center
the builds will be displayed
under macOS.


90
00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.109 line:-2 align:center
You can create groups
to manage testers


91
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,810 line:-1
and distribute each one,


92
00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:07.281 line:-1 align:center
very similar to iOS or tvOS.


93
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,582 line:-1
For each build,


94
00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:11.351 line:-2 align:center
you can view
the number of invited testers,


95
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,554 line:-1
installations on devices,


96
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,656 line:-1
sessions in the last seven days,


97
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,125 line:-1
crashes, and feedback count.


98
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,795 line:-2
These numbers are aggregated
across all of the testers.


99
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,831 line:-2
When you are looking
at App Store Connect


100
00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:28.135 line:-2 align:center
crashes or screenshots
feedback section,


101
00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:31.972 line:-2 align:center
you can filter by selecting
the platform macOS.


102
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,308 line:-2
You can further filter
the feedback


103
00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:39.146 line:-2 align:center
by selecting a specific
Mac device or MacOS version.


104
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,617 line:-2
As you see, native Mac apps
distribution with TestFlight


105
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,954 line:-1
is very similar to iOS and tvOS.


106
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:50,691 line:-2
Let's see how iOS apps
on Apple Silicon Macs


107
00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.126 line:-2 align:center
can be distributed
with TestFlight.


108
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,562 line:-1
For each tester group,


109
00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:57.965 line:-2 align:center
you can control
the TestFlight availability


110
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:01,635 line:-2
of iPhone and iPad apps
on Apple Silicon Macs.


111
00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:05.539 line:-2 align:center
When enabled,
the iOS builds in this group


112
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:10,010 line:-2
are available to TestFlight
on Apple Silicon Macs.


113
00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:11.311 line:-1 align:center
When this is disabled,


114
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:13,247 line:-1
all iOS builds from that group


115
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,716 line:-2
will stop being available
on Mac.


116
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,451 line:-1
This provides more flexibility


117
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,153 line:-2
to control
who can test the iOS apps


118
00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:22.656 line:-1 align:center
on Apple Silicon Macs.


119
00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.527 line:-2 align:center
The iOS builds are displayed
similar to today,


120
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,496 line:-2
but the counts displayed
will include the numbers


121
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.132 line:-2 align:center
from the Apple Silicon Macs
as well.


122
00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:34.868 line:-1 align:center
Similarly, you can see


123
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,571 line:-2
the crashes and screenshots
feedback


124
00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:39.106 line:-1 align:center
at App Store Connect


125
00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.275 line:-1 align:center
under the platform iOS


126
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,277 line:-1
and will include feedback


127
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,113 line:-2
submitted
from Apple Silicon Macs.


128
00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:48.982 line:-2 align:center
It's that simple
to make iOS apps


129
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:52,085 line:-2
distribute with TestFlight
on Apple Silicon Mac.


130
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,788 line:-2
Internal testing
has always made testing


131
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,925 line:-2
with your App Store Connect team
convenient.


132
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,594 line:-2
This year,
we have made new improvements


133
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:04,298 line:-2
to make internal group
management even more flexible.


134
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,201 line:-2
And it's applicable
for all supported platforms.


135
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,804 line:-2
You can now create
multiple internal groups


136
00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:13.273 line:-1 align:center
similar to external groups.


137
00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:16.310 line:-2 align:center
You can also configure
distribution of builds


138
00:06:16.343 --> 00:06:19.613 line:-2 align:center
and collection of feedback
per internal group.


139
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.316 line:-1 align:center
For example, let's say you have


140
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,918 line:-2
a Development Team
and a QA Team.


141
00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:27.254 line:-2 align:center
You can now create
an internal group


142
00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:28.922 line:-1 align:center
for each of them.


143
00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:30.557 line:-2 align:center
You can give
the Development Team


144
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:34,261 line:-2
access to all builds as part
of the development life cycle,


145
00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:37.297 line:-2 align:center
while the QA Team
may only require access


146
00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:39.566 line:-1 align:center
to specific stable builds.


147
00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:41.835 line:-1 align:center
For the Development Team,


148
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,838 line:-2
you would enable the automatic
distribution flag


149
00:06:44.872 --> 00:06:47.674 line:-2 align:center
to make all current
and future builds


150
00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:49.443 line:-1 align:center
available to this group,


151
00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:50.777 line:-1 align:center
whereas for the QA team,


152
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:54.681 line:-2 align:center
you would choose
to manually add specific builds.


153
00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:56.683 line:-2 align:center
Now that you saw
how internal groups


154
00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:58.952 line:-1 align:center
can be configured per use case,


155
00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.355 line:-2 align:center
I want to show you
how to set it up.


156
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,025 line:-2
You can create the groups
for each team


157
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:09,263 line:-2
by clicking on the plus button
next to Internal Testing.


158
00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:12.499 line:-2 align:center
Now give your internal group
a name.


159
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,834 line:-1
For the Dev Team,


160
00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:17.137 line:-2 align:center
choose
Enable automatic distribution.


161
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:18.472 line:-1 align:center
While for QA Team,


162
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:22,009 line:-2
you can uncheck
Enable automatic distribution


163
00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:24.678 line:-1 align:center
and click Create.


164
00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:26.380 line:-1 align:center
Once the groups are created,


165
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,347 line:-1
for QA team,


166
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,917 line:-2
you can click
on the plus button to


167
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,987 line:-2
manually select the builds
to be added to the group.


168
00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:35.322 line:-1 align:center
Then for each group,


169
00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:38.926 line:-2 align:center
you can click on the plus button
next to Testers


170
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,527 line:-1
to manually select the ones


171
00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:44.031 line:-2 align:center
applicable for the groups
and add them.


172
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,933 line:-1
You also have the option


173
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:49.236 line:-2 align:center
to enable or disable
the feedback per group,


174
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,171 line:-1
just like external testing.


175
00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:54.775 line:-2 align:center
If you use
the App Store Connect API,


176
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,645 line:-2
you can manage internal groups
with different configurations


177
00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:00.914 line:-1 align:center
through the BetaGroups Resource.


178
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:05,018 line:-2
Similarly if you use
App Store Connect on iOS,


179
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,788 line:-2
they can also be managed
from there.


180
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,424 line:-2
Well, these are
the major improvements


181
00:08:10.457 --> 00:08:13.026 line:-2 align:center
to make internal testing
more flexible.


182
00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:18.265 line:-2 align:center
Lastly, we have integrated
exciting Xcode Cloud features


183
00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:20.334 line:-1 align:center
directly into TestFlight.


184
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:24.137 line:-2 align:center
This week,
Apple introduced Xcode Cloud.


185
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,574 line:-2
Xcode Cloud integrates
with TestFlight


186
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,643 line:-2
and provides
a seamless experience


187
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:34.281 line:-2 align:center
to automatically build, test,
and distribute your apps.


188
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,683 align:center
To learn more about Xcode Cloud,


189
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,786 align:center
check out the session
"Meet Xcode Cloud."


190
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:44,725 line:-2
First, Xcode Cloud
manages beta build distribution


191
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,928 line:-2
through TestFlight to provide
a seamless experience


192
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:52,232 line:-2
by automatically distributing
builds to specific beta groups.


193
00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:55.636 line:-2 align:center
Second, your builds
are organized in the way


194
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,539 line:-2
your development team works
via Build Groups.


195
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,742 line:-2
Let me show you
how it looks like


196
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,076 line:-1
in App Store Connect.


197
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,814 line:-2
Here is the Builds Groups view,
where you will find builds


198
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:12,085 line:-2
grouped by the Xcode Cloud
workflow and GIT branch.


199
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,087 line:-1
They are supported


200
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:17,157 line:-2
in the App Store Connect app
on iOS, too.


201
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,527 line:-2
For internal testers
on TestFlight,


202
00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:23.564 line:-2 align:center
the Build Groups display
makes it easier


203
00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:27.434 line:-2 align:center
to find builds based on the more
familiar GIT branch names


204
00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:31.338 line:-2 align:center
and Xcode Cloud workflows
for internal testing.


205
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,076 line:-2
You can also filter feedback
by a specific Build Group


206
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,346 line:-2
under the Feedback section
in App Store Connect.


207
00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:42.382 line:-2 align:center
Well, these are
the amazing features
