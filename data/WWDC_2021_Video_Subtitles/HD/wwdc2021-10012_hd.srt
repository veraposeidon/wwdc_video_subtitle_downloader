[Yongjun]
Hi!


4
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:13,247 line:-2
Welcome to WWDC.
My name's Yongjun.


5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.315 line:-2 align:center
I'm an engineer
from App Clips team.


6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,684 line:-2
I'm joined today
by my colleague, Luming,


7
00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:20.787 line:-2 align:center
to talk about what's new
in App Clips.


8
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:24.191 line:-2 align:center
An App Clip is a small part
of an app that can be launched


9
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,159 line:-1
at the moment when it's needed.


10
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:30,631 line:-2
It provides fast and focused
experience on a specific task.


11
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,133 line:-2
User can easily upgrade
to your app


12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,836 line:-1
after they complete the task.


13
00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.805 line:-2 align:center
Since it's launched, we have
seen many great App Clips


14
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,974 line:-2
from developers
all over the world.


15
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.243 line:-2 align:center
They are well designed,
easily discoverable,


16
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,646 line:-1
with great ways to engage users.


17
00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.515 line:-2 align:center
Let me share some examples
with you.


18
00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.250 line:-1 align:center
Firi Games has an App Clip


19
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,252 line:-2
for their popular
Phoenix 2 game.


20
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:56,056 line:-2
I can go to their web site
in Safari, tap the banner.


21
00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.992 line:-2 align:center
It will show the App Clip Card
for this game.


22
00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:02.529 line:-2 align:center
From there,
I can launch the game.


23
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:07,534 line:-2
In a couple seconds,
the game's ready to play.


24
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,369 line:-1
After I play the first level,


25
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:13,907 line:-2
I can download the full game
right from the App Clip.


26
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.642 line:-1 align:center
TikTok has an App Clip


27
00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:18.412 line:-2 align:center
to make sharing video
really fun and easy.


28
00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.714 line:-2 align:center
When I receive a video
from my friend,


29
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:25,018 line:-2
iMessage will show
the TikTok App Clip preview.


30
00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:27.287 line:-2 align:center
Tap of the preview
shows the card.


31
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,891 line:-2
There I can
open TikTok App Clip.


32
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,894 line:-2
I can enjoy the video
right away.


33
00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.864 line:-2 align:center
Panera bread
is a U.S.-based food service


34
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,565 line:-1
with thousands of stores.


35
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,034 line:-2
If I look up one of the stores
in Maps,


36
00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:44.171 line:-2 align:center
the place card will show
"order food" action button.


37
00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:47.341 line:-2 align:center
I can open their App Clip
right from there.


38
00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:49.610 line:-2 align:center
Within seconds,
the App Clip launches


39
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:53,280 line:-2
and shows the menu
for this particular store.


40
00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:56.550 line:-2 align:center
I can make order
and pay with Apple Pay.


41
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,753 line:-2
In iOS 15, if I search
a business in Spotlight,


42
00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:04.291 line:-2 align:center
like Panera, the App Clip will
show up in search results, too.


43
00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:08.695 line:-2 align:center
With on-device intelligence,
if I'm nearby Panera store,


44
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,531 line:-2
my phone can suggest
the App Clip


45
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,033 line:-1
to me in Siri suggestion widget.


46
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:18.338 line:-2 align:center
Tap the suggestion, I can open
it and order food right away.


47
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,140 line:-1
Honk created an App Clip


48
00:02:20.174 --> 00:02:22.543 line:-2 align:center
for touchless payment
for parking.


49
00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.078 line:-2 align:center
All I need to do is
scan their QR code


50
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,214 line:-1
attached at the parking lot.


51
00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.716 line:-2 align:center
With one tap,
I can open the App Clip


52
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.252 line:-1 align:center
and pay with Apple Pay.


53
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,822 line:-2
Primer AR Home Design has
an App Clip for you to try


54
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:39,726 line:-2
paint, tile, and wallpaper
in an AR environment.


55
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.262 line:-2 align:center
I can scan
or tap the App Clip code


56
00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:45.065 line:-1 align:center
on a tile to open the App Clip.


57
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,001 line:-2
There, I can experience
how this beautiful tile


58
00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:51.338 line:-2 align:center
would look like
in my living room.


59
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,874 line:-2
These are some great
example App Clips.


60
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,509 line:-1
There are many, many more.


61
00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.245 line:-2 align:center
You can discovered them
in Safari, Messages,


62
00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:03.450 line:-2 align:center
or in the real world by a QR
code, NFC tag, or App Clip code.


63
00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:08.222 line:-2 align:center
I encourage you to try them out
and see what App Clips can do.


64
00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:11.425 line:-2 align:center
In this session,
we will cover three topics.


65
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:16,530 line:-2
First, App Clip Card in Safari
and SafariViewController.


66
00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:21.835 line:-2 align:center
Then, we will talk about testing
App Clip with local experiences.


67
00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:25.305 line:-2 align:center
Last, we will cover
App Clip code.


68
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:31.345 line:-2 align:center
Let's look at a new way
to explore App Clips.


69
00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.848 line:-2 align:center
Your website can use
apple-itunes-app meta tag


70
00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:36.650 line:-1 align:center
to display the smart app banner


71
00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.419 line:-2 align:center
in Safari
or Safari View Controller.


72
00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:43.123 line:-2 align:center
In iOS 15, you can configure
the meta tag to show


73
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:47,694 line:-2
a full-sized App Clip Card,
right in the middle of web page.


74
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,998 line:-2
User can
open your App Clip from there.


75
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,868 line:-2
If they choose "View in Safari,"
Safari will remember the choice


76
00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:57.604 line:-2 align:center
and not show the card next time
the page is loaded again.


77
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:01,675 line:-2
And it will fall back
to the original banner.


78
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,777 line:-1
To opt-in card mode,


79
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,513 line:-2
you just need to add
"app-clip-display" key


80
00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:10.784 line:-2 align:center
to the meta tag
and set it to "card."


81
00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.053 line:-1 align:center
The card mode works great


82
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,190 line:-2
if you like to promote
your App Clip in the web page.


83
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,425 line:-2
For apps
using SafariViewController


84
00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.861 line:-2 align:center
to render web content,
like Twitter,


85
00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:24.264 line:-2 align:center
it can show the card
as a part of the app's UI.


86
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,300 line:-2
Now, user
can launch the App Clip


87
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,702 line:-1
directly from the app.


88
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,142 line:-2
This is the App Clip Card
in Safari


89
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,611 line:-1
and SafariViewController.


90
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:42,015 line:-2
Let's talk about test
with local experiences.


91
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,852 line:-2
For users,
their App Clip experience


92
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,388 line:-1
starts with the App Clip Card.


93
00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:51.725 line:-2 align:center
The card shows your App Clip's
title, subtitle,


94
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,294 line:-2
what action can take,
and a header image


95
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,864 line:-1
to show your brand and style.


96
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,100 line:-2
You can create an App Clip Card
in App Store Connect.


97
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,737 line:-2
Follow the step-by-step guide
to configure all the elements.


98
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.708 line:-2 align:center
You can also specify locations
associated with your App Clip.


99
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:11.078 line:-2 align:center
This could make the App Clip
show up in Maps place card,


100
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:16,283 line:-2
Siri suggestion widget,
or Spotlight search.


101
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:20.320 line:-2 align:center
To know about how to customize
App Clip Card, please refer


102
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:24,157 line:-2
to WWDC20 sessions, "What's
new in App Store Connect"


103
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,960 line:-2
and "Configure
and link your App Clips."


104
00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.830 line:-2 align:center
Now, when you develop
your App Clip, you might


105
00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:33.200 line:-2 align:center
not have registered
any App Clip experiences yet.


106
00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:35.969 line:-2 align:center
Sometimes, you do want
to test the end-to-end flow


107
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,172 line:-2
and role-play
the whole experience.


108
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,175 line:-2
You can do
that with local experiences.


109
00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:44.077 line:-2 align:center
A local experience is
an experience you enter


110
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:46.146 line:-1 align:center
in your own testing device.


111
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.714 line:-1 align:center
You can launch it with most


112
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:51,451 line:-2
of regular
App Clip invocation methods.


113
00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:54.788 line:-2 align:center
To create a local experience,
go to Developer Settings


114
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.858 line:-1 align:center
and select Local Experiences.


115
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:01.628 line:-2 align:center
Specify your App Clip's name,
title, URL prefix,


116
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,830 line:-1
bundleID, and select an image


117
00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.900 line:-2 align:center
in your photo library
as the header image.


118
00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:10.003 line:-2 align:center
You can then scan
a QR code or NFC tag


119
00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:12.206 line:-1 align:center
to launch the experience.


120
00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:16.343 line:-2 align:center
Local experiences support QR,
NFC, App Clip Code,


121
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.412 line:-1 align:center
Safari, and Messages.


122
00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:19.980 line:-1 align:center
They don't show up in Maps,


123
00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:23.250 line:-2 align:center
location suggestions,
and Spotlight search.


124
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,186 line:-2
These require
registered experiences.


125
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.223 line:-2 align:center
Also, you can only
specify local experiences


126
00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:33.427 line:-2 align:center
for Xcode-installed App Clips
or App Clips in Beta testing.


127
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,864 line:-2
This is how you can test
with local experiences.


128
00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.799 line:-2 align:center
With that, I would like
to hand over


129
00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:41.034 line:-1 align:center
to Luming to show you a demo.


130
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,136 line:-2
[Luming]
Thanks, Yongjun!


131
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.405 line:-2 align:center
As Yongjun mentioned
in the talk,


132
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,674 line:-2
you can now configure
the meta tag


133
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,245 line:-2
to show a full-sized App Clip
Card right in the middle


134
00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:55.716 line:-2 align:center
of the web page in both Safari
and SafariViewController.


135
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,254 line:-1
I'm in the FoodGrid app,


136
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,489 line:-2
a third-party app
my friend has built,


137
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,825 line:-2
which helps you
discover nearby restaurants


138
00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:06.393 line:-1 align:center
and beverage shops.


139
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,862 line:-2
As you can see,
my smoothie stand, Fruta,


140
00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:11.031 line:-2 align:center
is featured
in this FoodGrid app.


141
00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:14.701 line:-2 align:center
Tapping on my smoothie stand,
Fruta, in my friend's app opens


142
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:18,472 line:-2
a SafariViewController showing
my smoothie stand website.


143
00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:21.808 line:-2 align:center
Because my smoothie stand
website has already adopted


144
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:26,146 line:-2
Smart App Banner meta tag
for iOS 14 and iPadOS 14,


145
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.549 line:-2 align:center
my customers can open
the Fruta App Clip


146
00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:29.983 line:-1 align:center
from the Smart App Banner,


147
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:33,153 line:-2
but opening the App Clip this
way requires the customer


148
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:37,057 line:-2
discovering the banner,
tapping open, then confirming it


149
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,561 line:-2
in the App Clip Card,
which is a multi step process.


150
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:45,265 line:-2
So, adopting the new full-sized
App Clip Card for iOS 15


151
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:50,637 line:-2
and iPadOS 15 is a great way
to promote and elevate discovery


152
00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:52.940 line:-2 align:center
of our Fruta smoothie stand
App Clip


153
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,143 line:-2
within the web page
or within third-party apps


154
00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:59.379 line:-2 align:center
that embed our website
through SafariViewController.


155
00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:01.715 line:-1 align:center
Let's see how to do just that.


156
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:06,253 line:-2
Here, I am on the Fruta web
server that hosts our website.


157
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:10,190 line:-2
Within the apple-itunes-app
meta tag, I just need


158
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:15,596 line:-2
to add "app-clip-display,"
and set its value to "card."


159
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:19,166 line:-2
Now, if I tap to open
the restaurant website again


160
00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:21.368 line:-2 align:center
in the FoodGrid app,
you will notice


161
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,537 line:-2
the App Clip Card shows up
immediately


162
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,274 line:-2
within the web page as a part
of the FoodGrid app's UI.


163
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,610 line:-2
The user can then launch
the Fruta App Clip


164
00:08:29.643 --> 00:08:33.046 line:-2 align:center
directly
from this third-party app.


165
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,948 line:-1
Back to you, Yongjun.


166
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,483 line:-2
[Yongjun]
Thank you, Luming.


167
00:08:36.517 --> 00:08:38.385 line:-2 align:center
Now, I know
how to launch my App Clip


168
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,788 line:-2
from the app with the help
of SFSafariViewController.


169
00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:45.025 line:-2 align:center
Now, let's talk
about App Clip code.


170
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,662 line:-2
App Clip code is a new,
Apple-designed visual code.


171
00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:51.832 line:-2 align:center
It is the best way
to discover App Clip experiences


172
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,534 line:-1
in the real world.


173
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:57,004 line:-1
It is available from iOS 14.3.


174
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,373 line:-2
So, there are
almost 1 billion devices ready


175
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,642 line:-1
for your App Clip code.


176
00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:05.612 line:-2 align:center
An App Clip code always leads
to an App Clip.


177
00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:07.614 line:-1 align:center
When the user sees such a code,


178
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:11,285 line:-2
they know there's an App Clip
to explore.


179
00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:15.656 line:-2 align:center
Each code encodes a unique URL
for specific experience.


180
00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:19.226 line:-2 align:center
iOS decodes the URL
before sending to the App Clip.


181
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,595 line:-2
This means your App Clip
doesn't need


182
00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:24.264 line:-2 align:center
to do anything special
to handle these codes.


183
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:28,836 line:-2
Your existing URL handling
will just work.


184
00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:31.238 line:-2 align:center
There are two types
of App Clip code:


185
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,274 line:-1
NFC integrated or Scan only.


186
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:37,144 line:-2
User can interact
with NFC-integrated code


187
00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:39.880 line:-2 align:center
by tap it or scanning it
with the camera.


188
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,450 line:-2
Use this type when customer
can easily access the code.


189
00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:45.586 line:-2 align:center
For example,
on a vending machine,


190
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:49,690 line:-2
or on a restaurant table,
or on storefront window.


191
00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:53.527 line:-2 align:center
Use scan only if the code
may be placed out of reach


192
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,664 line:-2
for the customer,
or when NFC is not appropriate.


193
00:09:57.698 --> 00:10:00.901 line:-2 align:center
For example,
when it is displayed digitally


194
00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:04.538 line:-1 align:center
in a marketing email.


195
00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:07.241 line:-2 align:center
You can customize
the style of App Clip code


196
00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:09.910 line:-1 align:center
to fit specific use cases.


197
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,213 line:-2
You can pick you own foreground
or background color.


198
00:10:13.247 --> 00:10:15.849 line:-2 align:center
You can also
hide the App Clip logo.


199
00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:19.319 line:-2 align:center
We suggest to show the logo
when there is enough space.


200
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:22,189 line:-2
This gives new customer
a clear message


201
00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:24.858 line:-1 align:center
that it is for App Clips.


202
00:10:24.892 --> 00:10:27.461 line:-1 align:center
If you have an ARKit App Clip,


203
00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:29.997 line:-2 align:center
you can use App Clip code
as an anchor,


204
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.933 line:-2 align:center
tracking its position
in the physical world.


205
00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.402 line:-2 align:center
This could
bring amazing experiences.


206
00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:37.871 line:-2 align:center
For example,
a user can scan an App Clip code


207
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:40,507 line:-2
on a package,
exploring what is inside,


208
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:44,778 line:-2
like this guitar,
without opening the package.


209
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,748 line:-2
To know more
about App Clip code and ARKit,


210
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:53.754 line:-2 align:center
please check out WWDC21 session,
"Explore ARKit 5."


211
00:10:53.787 --> 00:10:56.356 line:-2 align:center
There are two ways
to create an App Clip code.


212
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.859 line:-2 align:center
You can use
the App Clip Code Generator tool,


213
00:10:58.892 --> 00:11:01.628 line:-2 align:center
available
from developer.apple.com,


214
00:11:01.662 --> 00:11:06.767 line:-2 align:center
or you can download the code
directly from App Store Connect.


215
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.303 line:-2 align:center
We recommend
to use the command-line tool


216
00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:11.939 line:-2 align:center
when you're testing
or developing an App Clip,


217
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:15,475 line:-2
or you need
to automate code generation.


218
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:20.380 line:-2 align:center
Use App Store Connect to create
codes for registered URLs.


219
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,349 line:-2
For the best scanning
experience,


220
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,484 line:-2
here are some guidelines
to keep in mind.


221
00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:28.322 line:-2 align:center
First, keep the code
on a flat surface.


222
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,391 line:-2
The code should be placed
at upright position.


223
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:36,063 line:-2
Make sure you don't rotate
the code or the central logo.


224
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:40,167 line:-2
Small codes are harder
for customers to see and scan,


225
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:45.205 line:-2 align:center
so make sure your code is large
enough, at least 1 inch wide.


226
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,775 line:-1
Ensure good visibility.


227
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,612 line:-2
Make sure your code is
not blocked, damaged,


228
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:56,149 line:-2
or placed too close
to other codes.


229
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:59,253 line:-2
You can add a text next
to the code to inform people


230
00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:02.122 line:-2 align:center
how they can use it
to launch your App Clip.


231
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:07,127 line:-2
Make sure the message is concise
and with a clear call to action.


232
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.396 line:-2 align:center
For more information,
please check


233
00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:14.268 line:-2 align:center
the Human Interface Guidelines
and This is App Clip Code.


234
00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:17.004 line:-2 align:center
I would like to hand
over to Luming, again,


235
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,641 line:-2
to show you how to quickly
generate App Clip Codes.


236
00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:23.076 line:-2 align:center
[Luming]
Thanks, Yongjun!


237
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.778 line:-1 align:center
As Yongjun mentioned,


238
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,948 line:-2
the easiest way
to generate an App Clip Code is


239
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,951 line:-2
to download it
from App Store Connect.


240
00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:33.921 line:-2 align:center
For cases where you
need more customization,


241
00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:37.224 line:-2 align:center
or need to script App Clip Code
generation in bulk,


242
00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:41.094 line:-2 align:center
generating them locally using
the App Clip Code Generator


243
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:44,164 line:-2
command-line
tool is a great option.


244
00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:46.366 line:-2 align:center
I've already downloaded
and installed


245
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.269 line:-2 align:center
App Clip Code Generator
from the Apple Developer website


246
00:12:49.303 --> 00:12:52.105 line:-2 align:center
onto my Mac,
so I can open Terminal


247
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,607 line:-1
and interact with the tool.


248
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.676 line:-1 align:center
It's really easy to use.


249
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,478 line:-2
As Yongjun mentioned,
there are a variety


250
00:12:58.512 --> 00:13:00.547 line:-2 align:center
of templates available
to choose.


251
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:04,618 line:-2
And I can enter
"App Clip Code Generator templates"


252
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:08,222 line:-2
to view a list
of all available templates.


253
00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:10.991 line:-2 align:center
But how do these templates look,
exactly?


254
00:13:11.024 --> 00:13:13.360 line:-2 align:center
Well, you can
find a preview of all


255
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,730 line:-2
of these template
at the following location:


256
00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:22.870 line:-2 align:center
/Library/Developer/AppClipCode
Generator/SampleTemplates.


257
00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:25.772 line:-2 align:center
Let's look
at these using Quick Look.


258
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,112 line:-1
Number 4 looks really great,


259
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.381 line:-2 align:center
so I'm going
to generate an App Clip Code


260
00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:38.886 line:-2 align:center
using this template
for our Fruta App Clip.


261
00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:42.856 line:-2 align:center
I'll enter
"AppClipCodeGenerator generate."


262
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,425 line:-2
We'll generate
an NFC App Clip Code


263
00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:47.094 line:-1 align:center
since I'll place an NFC tag


264
00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:51.298 line:-2 align:center
behind the printed
App Clip Code.


265
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,101 line:-2
I'll pass in a URL
that I have registered


266
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,270 line:-2
as an advanced App Clip
experience


267
00:13:56.303 --> 00:14:00.507 line:-2 align:center
on App Store Connect,
which is fruta.example.


268
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:04,011 line:-2
I'll choose template 4,
which we figure looks great


269
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:08,115 line:-2
from the Quick Look preview
in Finder.


270
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,050 line:-1
Finally, I'll pass in


271
00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:14.922 line:-2 align:center
the desired output
SVG file name fruta.svg.


272
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,625 line:-1
SVG graphics are vector based,


273
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,228 line:-2
so they scale beautifully
when you print them


274
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,797 line:-2
from a piece
of U.S.-letter-sized paper,


275
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.367 line:-2 align:center
all the way
to a 24-by-36 poster.


276
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:31,738 line:-2
Let's open a generated SVG
in Safari to preview it.


277
00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.345 line:-2 align:center
I have already printed
this App Clip Code


278
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,948 line:-2
on a poster,
so let's try scanning it


279
00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:44.384 line:-2 align:center
from the Code Scanner module
in Control Center.


280
00:14:53.126 --> 00:14:54.695 line:-1 align:center
And here we are.


281
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,531 line:-2
We are now
in the Fruta App Clip.


282
00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:00.200 line:-2 align:center
And that is
a quick demonstration


283
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,703 line:-2
of how to generate App Clip Code
using


284
00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:05.973 line:-2 align:center
the App Clip Code Generator
command-line tool.


285
00:15:06.006 --> 00:15:07.808 line:-1 align:center
Back to you, Yongjun.


286
00:15:07.841 --> 00:15:09.309 line:-2 align:center
[Yongjun]
Thanks, Luming.


287
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:13,647 line:-2
Now, I know how to generate my
own codes with different styles.


288
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,616 line:-1
To wrap up, in this session,


289
00:15:15.649 --> 00:15:18.252 line:-2 align:center
we looked
at some great App Clips.


290
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:21,221 line:-2
Then, we talked
about App Clip card in Safari


291
00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:23.457 line:-1 align:center
and SafariViewController.


292
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.494 line:-2 align:center
We also discussed how to test
with local experiences.


293
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:30,297 line:-1
Last, we covered App Clip Code,


294
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,668 line:-2
an Apple-designed visual code
for App Clips.


295
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,670 line:-2
Thank you,
and I'm looking forward


296
00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:39.640 line:-2 align:center
to trying more great App Clips
from you.


297
00:15:39.673 --> 00:15:42.075 line:-1 align:center
Have a great WWDC.


298
00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:44.178 line:-1 align:center
