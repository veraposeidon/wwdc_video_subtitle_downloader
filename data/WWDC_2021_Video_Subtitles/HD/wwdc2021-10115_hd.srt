00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.377 line:-1 align:center
[Mahesh] Hi.


4
00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:12.346 line:-2 align:center
My name is
Mahesh Molakalapalli.


5
00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:15.582 line:-2 align:center
I'm an engineering manager
from the App Store team.


6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,752 line:-2
In this session,
I am excited to introduce you


7
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,355 line:-2
to the newly redesigned
App Analytics


8
00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.191 line:-2 align:center
and highlight
a number of updates.


9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:28,562 line:-2
Our goal with App Analytics is
to maximize your opportunity


10
00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:32.432 line:-2 align:center
on the App Store by
providing unique insights.


11
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,802 line:-2
We do this by sharing metrics
about your app


12
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,438 line:-2
across the entire
App Store ecosystem


13
00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.575 line:-2 align:center
without requiring you
to add any code.


14
00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:46.813 line:-2 align:center
Today, I will tell you four
new ways that App Analytics


15
00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:51.485 line:-2 align:center
gives you the data you need
to grow your business.


16
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:55,122 line:-2
I will talk about the new
metrics that allow you


17
00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:59.026 line:-2 align:center
to monitor transactions
better than before.


18
00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:03.430 line:-2 align:center
Then I will show you how
you can measure macOS usage,


19
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,401 line:-2
including for iPhone
and iPad apps on Mac.


20
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,070 line:-2
After that,
I will talk about how you can


21
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.174 line:-2 align:center
use data to analyze
your App Clips performance.


22
00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:17.411 line:-2 align:center
I will end with how you can
enhance your presence


23
00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.280 line:-2 align:center
on the App Store
with Custom Product Pages,


24
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.784 line:-2 align:center
In-App Events,
and Product Page Optimization.


25
00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:27.621 line:-2 align:center
Let's start with monitoring
store transactions.


26
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,657 line:-2
Later this year,
we will be adding


27
00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.727 line:-2 align:center
a lot of new metrics
to App Analytics,


28
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,964 line:-2
helping you better understand
transactions


29
00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:39.967 line:-2 align:center
from pre-orders
to total downloads.


30
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:43,871 line:-2
To help bring this data
to life, I will be using


31
00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:47.474 line:-2 align:center
my favorite test app,
Mountain Climber.


32
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,143 line:-1
This app helps customers view


33
00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:53.180 line:-2 align:center
livestreams of hikes
at famous mountains


34
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,083 line:-2
so that people
can enjoy the outdoors


35
00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:58.485 line:-1 align:center
while staying at home.


36
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:02,189 line:-2
Let's pretend you are the
developer of Mountain Climber,


37
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,424 line:-2
and you are about to launch
your app


38
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,193 line:-1
for the very first time.


39
00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:10.097 line:-2 align:center
Your app will be live-streaming
a climb up Half Dome


40
00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:13.400 line:-2 align:center
as your inaugural event,
and you want to get


41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,270 line:-2
as many people onto the app
as you can


42
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.972 line:-1 align:center
in anticipation of the climb.


43
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,976 line:-2
In order to generate
that excitement,


44
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,745 line:-1
you set up a pre-order


45
00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:27.614 line:-2 align:center
to drive people
to your product page,


46
00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.283 line:-1 align:center
as you want to make sure


47
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:33,654 line:-2
your customers have the app
on day one.


48
00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:36.690 line:-2 align:center
Later this year,
App Analytics will let you


49
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.526 line:-2 align:center
monitor how your
pre-order campaign


50
00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:42.029 line:-2 align:center
is driving interest
in your app


51
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:45,032 line:-2
with a brand-new
pre-order dashboard.


52
00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:48.535 line:-2 align:center
This dedicated dashboard
will let you see how many


53
00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:54.308 line:-2 align:center
Impressions, Product Page Views,
and Pre-Orders you have.


54
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,244 line:-2
And you will be able
to view your pre-orders


55
00:02:57.244 --> 00:03:00.547 line:-1 align:center
by device and by source type.


56
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,684 line:-1
You can also view by territory.


57
00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:05.686 line:-1 align:center
This will help you to see


58
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,222 line:-2
where your pre-orders
are coming from


59
00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:11.792 line:-2 align:center
and focus your marketing
efforts on those areas.


60
00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:16.163 line:-2 align:center
And on the Metrics tab,
you will be able to see


61
00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:20.300 line:-2 align:center
how your pre-orders
are rolling in over time.


62
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.637 line:-2 align:center
It is common to see a large
spike in the beginning


63
00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:26.373 line:-2 align:center
when the pre-order
is first launched.


64
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,075 line:-1
This is a good indication


65
00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:30.210 line:-2 align:center
that some of your
future customers


66
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,914 line:-2
are very excited
about your app.


67
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,816 line:-2
When your pre-order
is complete


68
00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:38.819 line:-2 align:center
and your app
becomes ready for sale,


69
00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.988 line:-1 align:center
the dashboard will open up


70
00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:45.692 line:-2 align:center
and show all of the metrics
for your app.


71
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,529 line:-1
Once Mountain Climber goes live,


72
00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:52.599 line:-2 align:center
it's time to see how many
purchases you are getting.


73
00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.569 line:-2 align:center
You are selling access
to the Half Dome stream.


74
00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.872 line:-2 align:center
And in this case,
it costs $0.99


75
00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:02.442 line:-2 align:center
to have unlimited access
to the climb.


76
00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.811 line:-2 align:center
The proceeds
from this transaction


77
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.548 line:-2 align:center
will be available
in App Analytics.


78
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.117 line:-1 align:center
To view your proceeds,


79
00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:14.788 line:-2 align:center
click on the drop-down
and select Proceeds.


80
00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:18.825 line:-2 align:center
This will pull up the Proceeds
chart so you can track it


81
00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:23.997 line:-2 align:center
over time and see if your
overall revenue is increasing.


82
00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.736 line:-2 align:center
Now, let's say you have just
released a new update


83
00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:34.808 line:-2 align:center
to Mountain Climber,
which you call version 1.1.


84
00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:37.678 line:-2 align:center
And you want to see
how many customers


85
00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:41.248 line:-2 align:center
have updated
to this latest version.


86
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:44,484 line:-2
Later this year,
you will be able to go into


87
00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:49.156 line:-2 align:center
App Analytics and see your
app updates over time.


88
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,658 line:-2
The total number of updates
tell you


89
00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:54.962 line:-2 align:center
how many customers have
your new app version,


90
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,297 line:-2
allowing them
to take advantage


91
00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.667 line:-2 align:center
of the new features
you just rolled out.


92
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,237 line:-1
Next up, re-downloads.


93
00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:07.174 line:-2 align:center
We know that customers might
remove apps from their devices


94
00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:10.410 line:-2 align:center
for different reasons,
and it's important for you


95
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,416 line:-2
to understand when and how your
app gets those customers back.


96
00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:20.954 line:-2 align:center
So later this year,
we're excited to introduce


97
00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:24.124 line:-1 align:center
re-downloads to App Analytics.


98
00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:28.495 line:-2 align:center
You will be able to view
re-downloads by territory,


99
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.798 line:-2 align:center
device, and more,
so you can pinpoint


100
00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:34.501 line:-2 align:center
where your re-downloads
are coming from


101
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.504 line:-2 align:center
and adjust your
re-engagement strategy


102
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,440 line:-1
to maximize your customer base.


103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,576 line:-1
But it doesn't end there.


104
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,344 line:0
We are going even further


105
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,481 line:0
by providing
total downloads as well.


106
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:50,951 line:0
Total downloads represent
first-time downloads


107
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,620 align:center
plus re-downloads
and will give you


108
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,057 align:center
the most complete picture
of how many customers


109
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:00,661 line:0
are downloading
your app from the store.


110
00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:04.131 line:-2 align:center
Now that you know about
all the ways you will be able


111
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,700 line:-2
to monitor your
store transactions,


112
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.405 line:-2 align:center
let's talk about how you
can use macOS to reach


113
00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:14.675 line:-2 align:center
even more customers
with your app.


114
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,978 line:-2
With the introduction
of Mac with Apple Silicon,


115
00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:21.615 line:-2 align:center
iPhone and iPad apps
are now automatically


116
00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:25.686 line:-2 align:center
available on the Mac
with no additional code,


117
00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:30.123 line:-2 align:center
which lets you reach more
customers with your app.


118
00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:33.060 line:-2 align:center
Now you can see
how many customers


119
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.297 line:-2 align:center
are using your app
on the Mac in App Analytics.


120
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:41,201 line:-2
By selecting the dimension
drop-down at the top


121
00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:46.206 line:-2 align:center
and clicking on Device,
you can view data by device


122
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:51,545 line:-2
and see how many of your
sessions are coming from MacOS,


123
00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:54.882 line:-2 align:center
which falls under
the Desktop category.


124
00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:58.151 line:-1 align:center
Here we can see that


125
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,722 line:-2
there have been
over 6 million sessions on Mac


126
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,724 line:-1
in the last 30 days.


127
00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:08.462 line:-2 align:center
Clicking on the metrics
drop-down allows you


128
00:07:08.462 --> 00:07:12.633 line:-2 align:center
to see a number of other
new metrics for the Mac,


129
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:16,170 line:-2
including Installations,
Active Devices,


130
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.908 line:-2 align:center
active in the last 30 days,
Crashes, and Deletions.


131
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,377 line:-1
Let's take a look at crashes.


132
00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:27.514 line:-2 align:center
Looking at the data,
it looks like Mountain Climber


133
00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:30.951 line:-2 align:center
has very few crashes
on the desktop.


134
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,487 line:-2
Considering how many sessions
the app has,


135
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,423 line:-2
this is a good sign
that the app is stable


136
00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:39.927 line:-1 align:center
and working as expected on Mac.


137
00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:44.331 line:-2 align:center
Now you know how to measure
your macOS usage


138
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:48,669 line:-2
even if your app wasn't
originally built for the Mac.


139
00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:54.942 line:-2 align:center
Next, let's talk about how you
can analyze your App Clips.


140
00:07:54.942 --> 00:07:59.479 line:-2 align:center
App Clips are a great way
for customers to quickly


141
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:04.084 line:-2 align:center
access and experience
what your app has to offer.


142
00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:06.987 line:-2 align:center
Whether your customers
are ordering take-out


143
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,523 line:-2
from a restaurant,
renting a scooter,


144
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:13,093 line:-2
or setting up a new connected
appliance for the first time,


145
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,563 line:-2
they will be able to start
and finish an experience


146
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:20,501 line:-2
from your app in seconds,
with App Clips.


147
00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:25.239 line:-2 align:center
And now in App Analytics,
you can learn all about


148
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,808 line:-2
how your customers
are discovering


149
00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:30.077 line:-1 align:center
and using your app clip.


150
00:08:30.077 --> 00:08:32.846 line:-1 align:center
Let's take a look.


151
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,983 line:-2
On the Overview page,
we have a dedicated ribbon


152
00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:39.520 line:-2 align:center
to help you get a high-level
understanding of


153
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,989 line:-2
how your app clips
are performing


154
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:45,259 line:-2
by viewing Installations,
Sessions,


155
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,761 line:-2
and Crashes
for your clip.


156
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:51,265 line:-2
If you click on View Details,
you will be taken


157
00:08:51.265 --> 00:08:55.302 line:-2 align:center
to a more detailed Overview
page for App Clips.


158
00:08:55,302 --> 00:09:00,307 line:-2
Here, you can see how many
Card Views your clip has.


159
00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:02.943 line:-2 align:center
Cards are what pop up

As you can see, there are
a ton of great ways


170
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:45.552 line:-2 align:center
to analyze your App Clips and
see how your customers use them.


171
00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:48.789 line:-2 align:center
Lastly, let's talk about
how you can enhance


172
00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:51.425 line:-1 align:center
your presence on the App Store.


173
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:55,395 align:center
We have three new App Store
features coming up in the fall


174
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,731 line:0
that we are very excited about -


175
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,800 align:center
Product Page Optimization,


176
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,337 line:0
Custom Product Pages,
and In-App Events.


177
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:06,373 line:0
Each of these features
is designed to help you


178
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,977 align:center
acquire more customers
through the App Store.


179
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:13,013 line:0
Let's talk about how you
can use App Analytics


180
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,550 line:0
alongside
each of these features.


181
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.287 line:-2 align:center
First, let's talk about
Product Page Optimization.


182
00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:23.924 line:-2 align:center
With this feature,
you can set up and test


183
00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:27.160 line:-2 align:center
different variants
of your default page


184
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,963 line:-2
to determine which one
best works with


185
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.132 line:-1 align:center
your App Store visitors.


186
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,534 line:-1
As part of this,


187
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:37,104 line:-2
App Analytics will be
releasing a brand-new dashboard.


188
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,107 line:-2
The new dashboard
helps you determine


189
00:10:40.107 --> 00:10:44.077 line:-2 align:center
which variant results
in the best conversion rate.


190
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:48,849 line:-2
We will also perform statistical
analysis on the results


191
00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:51.051 line:-1 align:center
using a Bayesian methodology


192
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:54.555 line:-2 align:center
allowing you to monitor
the test over time.


193
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:59,092 line:-2
And you will also be able
to stop the test at any time.


194
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,262 line:-2
With this feature,
you can be sure that


195
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:07,034 line:-2
you are using your best icons,
screenshots, and preview videos.


196
00:11:08.202 --> 00:11:11.939 line:-2 align:center
Next, let's talk about
Custom Product Pages.


197
00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:14.775 line:-2 align:center
With this feature,
you will be able to customize


198
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:18,378 line:-2
the content of your product
pages and drive audience


199
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,715 line:-2
to the page you think
will be the most relevant.


200
00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:26.253 line:-2 align:center
Then in App Analytics,
you will be able to view


201
00:11:26.253 --> 00:11:30.591 line:-2 align:center
the results of each product page
across multiple metrics,


202
00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:33.894 line:-2 align:center
including product page views,
downloads,


203
00:11:33.894 --> 00:11:38.565 line:-2 align:center
conversion rate, proceeds,
retention, and more.


204
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:42,402 align:center
You can learn about both
Product Page Optimization


205
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,705 align:center
and Custom Product Pages
in the session called


206
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,942 align:center
"Get ready to optimize
your App Store product page."


207
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,246 line:-2
One more existing feature
that we announced


208
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,848 line:-1
is In-App Events.


209
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,851 line:-2
This lets you promote
app experiences


210
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,120 line:-1
happening within your apps


211
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,658 line:-2
on a particular date and time,
such as a game competition,


212
00:12:04.658 --> 00:12:07.861 line:-2 align:center
a live-streaming experience,
and more.


213
00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:12.332 line:-2 align:center
In App Analytics, you will
be able to see how your event


214
00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:16.937 line:-2 align:center
is performing on the store,
including how many impressions


215
00:12:16.937 --> 00:12:19.606 line:-1 align:center
your event had on the store,


216
00:12:19.606 --> 00:12:24.678 line:-2 align:center
how many people asked to be
notified when the event begins,


217
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:29,082 line:-2
how many customers downloaded
the app from your event page,


218
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,285 line:-1
and how many app opens


219
00:12:31.285 --> 00:12:34.788 line:-2 align:center
came from the event page
on the store.


220
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,457 line:-2
All of this will help you
understand


221
00:12:37.457 --> 00:12:40.761 line:-2 align:center
which events are catching
your customers' attention


222
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:44,431 line:0
and making them excited
about your app.


223
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,734 align:center
You can learn more about
In-App Events by viewing


224
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:52,172 line:0
the session "Meet In-App Events
on the App Store."


225
00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:56.043 line:-2 align:center
With that, I want to thank you
for watching this presentation.


226
00:12:56.043 --> 00:12:58.979 line:-2 align:center
To recap,
the goal of App Analytics


227
00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:03.417 line:-2 align:center
is to help you maximize your
opportunity on the App Store


228
00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:07.221 line:-2 align:center
by providing insights
that only Apple can offer.


229
00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:09.923 line:-2 align:center
