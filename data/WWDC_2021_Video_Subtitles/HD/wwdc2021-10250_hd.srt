[Mike]
Hello, and welcome to WWDC.


4
00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.114 line:-1 align:center
My name is Mike,


5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,716 line:-2
and today
we're going to walk through


6
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,518 line:-2
how to create
a custom symbol


7
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.353 line:-2 align:center
that takes advantage
of the new features


8
00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.688 line:-1 align:center
introduced in SF Symbols 3.


9
00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.291 line:-2 align:center
First, we'll recap
what a custom symbol is


10
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,894 line:-2
and when you may
want to use one.


11
00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:30.330 line:-2 align:center
Custom symbols involve
working with an SVG template.


12
00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:33.800 line:-2 align:center
With SF Symbols 3, we have
an all new template version,


13
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,203 line:-2
so we'll discuss the changes
from previous versions.


14
00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.307 line:-2 align:center
We'll walk through
how to generate templates,


15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,909 line:-2
edit your symbols,
and prepare them


16
00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:43.810 line:-2 align:center
for rendering modes
other than monochrome.


17
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,549 line:-2
We'll cover annotation,
the process of adding


18
00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.450 line:-2 align:center
rendering mode data
to your symbols.


19
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,787 line:-2
We'll discuss some
more advanced techniques


20
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.889 line:-2 align:center
that can drastically
impact your workflows.


21
00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.860 line:-2 align:center
And lastly, we'll wrap up
by covering exporting


22
00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.930 line:-2 align:center
for Xcode and distributing
your custom symbols.


23
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:06,667 line:-2
Let's get started.
So, what is a custom symbol?


24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,170 line:-2
Well, SF Symbols
were introduced in 2019.


25
00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:12.573 line:-1 align:center
In the initial release,


26
00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.741 line:-2 align:center
there were more
than 1,500 symbols


27
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,144 line:-1
available to use in your apps.


28
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,981 line:-2
Since then, the library
of symbols has only grown.


29
00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.183 line:-2 align:center
Two years later,
with SF Symbols 3,


30
00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:26.320 line:-1 align:center
it totals over 3,000 symbols.


31
00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.622 line:-2 align:center
Now, these symbols
cover a wide variety


32
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,324 line:-1
of subjects and categories.


33
00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:32.860 line:-2 align:center
But your app may have
a specific need


34
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.429 line:-2 align:center
that isn't fully captured
by an existing SF Symbol


35
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,632 line:-1
such as a teacup in a circle.


36
00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.634 line:-2 align:center
This is where
custom symbols come in.


37
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:45,672 line:-2
If you need a custom symbol,
you would draw it as a series


38
00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:50.511 line:-2 align:center
of vector paths and place it
in a custom symbol template.


39
00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:52.846 line:-2 align:center
The template
is in the SVG format,


40
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,249 line:-2
and includes your designs
and some guides.


41
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,653 line:-2
This template is the mechanism
for your own symbols


42
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,755 line:-2
to take advantage
of all the features


43
00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.491 line:-1 align:center
that SF Symbols have to offer.


44
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.027 line:-2 align:center
This includes
typographic alignment


45
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,197 line:-2
to make sure your symbols
look good next to text,


46
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.100 line:-2 align:center
margins for making sure
symbols are optically centered


47
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,103 line:-2
with one another when used
in lists and table views...


48
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:22,276 line:-2
Multiple weights to match text
and adjust to features


49
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.945 line:-2 align:center
such as accessibility bold
on iOS...


50
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,184 line:-2
And lastly,
three weight-matched scales


51
00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:34.321 line:-2 align:center
to adjust to the context
of different UI elements.


52
00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:35.789 line:-1 align:center
So those are the highlights


53
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,959 align:center
of SF Symbols
and custom symbols.


54
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,662 align:center
To review the basics
of a custom symbol template,


55
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,297 align:center
it's recommended to watch


56
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,202 line:0
"Introducing SF Symbols"
from WWDC 2019.


57
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,970 line:0
To learn more
about the design details


58
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,872 align:center
behind SF Symbols, check out


59
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:56,643 align:center
"What's new in SF Symbols"
from WWDC 2021.


60
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,379 line:-2
Now that we know
when to use a custom symbol,


61
00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:01.849 line:-2 align:center
let's review the template
that makes them possible.


62
00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.017 line:-2 align:center
To go along
with the new features


63
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,453 line:-2
in SF Symbols 3,
there's a new version


64
00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:10.524 line:-1 align:center
of the template, version 3.0.


65
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,758 line:-1
This version of the template


66
00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:13.694 line:-2 align:center
has some important
new capabilities


67
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,762 line:-1
compared to version 2.0,


68
00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.065 line:-2 align:center
and it requires Xcode 13
or greater.


69
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:24,705 line:-2
In 3.0, the left-margin
and right-margin guidelines


70
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,774 line:-2
have more explicit names,
indicating the design variant


71
00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:28.976 line:-1 align:center
that they correspond to.


72
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:34.281 line:-2 align:center
These margins, for example,
have the suffix "Regular-M."


73
00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.551 line:-2 align:center
This means
that for additional control


74
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,254 line:-2
over optical alignment
you can add margins


75
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,855 line:-1
to any variant in the template,


76
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,690 line:-2
and as long as they have
a suffix matching one


77
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,993 line:-2
of the design variants,
they will be respected.


78
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.129 line:-2 align:center
More importantly,
this format of the template


79
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,065 line:-2
is able to embed information
on how a symbol should look


80
00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.901 line:-1 align:center
in different rendering modes.


81
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,203 line:-2
We can embed data
for existing modes,


82
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,173 line:-2
such as monochrome
and multicolor,


83
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,909 line:-2
as well as data used
by the new hierarchical


84
00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:04.144 line:-1 align:center
and palette modes.


85
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,480 line:-2
On top of all of this,
the 3.0 template


86
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,882 line:-2
supports
some advanced functionality


87
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,684 line:-2
that can empower you
to accomplish more


88
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,586 line:-1
by doing less.


89
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.388 line:-1 align:center
We'll talk about this in detail


90
00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.356 line:-2 align:center
in the "advanced techniques"
section.


91
00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:19.293 line:-2 align:center
For the full specification
of the new template,


92
00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:21.228 line:-2 align:center
check out our updated
documentation at


93
00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:25.232 line:-1 align:center
Developer.Apple.com/SF-Symbols.


94
00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.136 line:-2 align:center
Now that we're familiar
with the new template,


95
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,405 line:-1
let's work on a custom symbol.


96
00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:33.040 line:-2 align:center
So I'm working
on a card game app


97
00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:35.309 line:-2 align:center
with some of my colleagues,
and the SF Symbols app


98
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,145 line:-2
has us covered for a lot
of symbols that we need.


99
00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:40.214 line:-2 align:center
There are four suits
as well as a stack


100
00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:42.983 line:-2 align:center
that we can use to represent
a deck of cards.


101
00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:45.152 line:-2 align:center
The only thing missing
is something we could use


102
00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:46.753 line:-2 align:center
to represent
the Queen of Hearts,


103
00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:49.389 line:-2 align:center
which will play a special role
in our app.


104
00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:53.493 line:-2 align:center
I'm picturing a symbol
of a crown with a heart on top.


105
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,563 line:-2
I can start by opening
the SF Symbols app


106
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,199 line:-2
so I can customize
an existing SF Symbol.


107
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,435 line:-2
This way, I'll have
some point of reference


108
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,104 line:-2
for stem thickness,
scale, and alignment.


109
00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:08.308 line:-2 align:center
If I search for "crown"
in the SF Symbols app,


110
00:05:08.342 --> 00:05:09.476 line:-1 align:center
I notice that we have


111
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,879 line:-2
a nice,
unfilled version available.


112
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,847 line:-2
This will be
a great starting point.


113
00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:15.682 line:-2 align:center
All I need to add
is the heart on top.


114
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,419 line:-2
I can select "crown,"
and from the contextual menu


115
00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:22.556 line:-2 align:center
select Duplicate
as Custom Symbol.


116
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,025 line:-2
And under the Custom Symbols
section in the sidebar,


117
00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:28.462 line:-2 align:center
there's now a cell for the crown
I just duplicated.


118
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,632 line:-2
"Custom.crown" is a bit vague,
so I'll rename it.


119
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,635 line:-2
"Queen.heart"
is much more descriptive


120
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.737 line:-1 align:center
of what I have in mind.


121
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.640 line:-2 align:center
Now, this is a good way
to start a new custom symbol,


122
00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.608 line:-2 align:center
but you may have some symbols
from past years


123
00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:45.012 line:-2 align:center
as 1.0 and 2.0
custom symbol templates.


124
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,713 line:-1
That's not a problem.


125
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,849 line:-2
You can drop
the existing symbol on the app,


126
00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:50.184 line:-2 align:center
and it will automatically
get added


127
00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:52.619 line:-2 align:center
to the current collection
and up-converted


128
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,054 line:-1
to a 3.0 template.


129
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:56.757 line:-2 align:center
Once the symbol
is in my collection,


130
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.526 line:-2 align:center
whether I copied an SF Symbol,
like "crown,"


131
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,496 line:-2
or imported a custom symbol
like "Teacup.circle,"


132
00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.332 line:-2 align:center
I can export it for editing
in my design app of choice


133
00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:08.235 line:-2 align:center
such as Sketch,
Illustrator, or Figma.


134
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:12,439 line:-2
To do so, I can select
File Export Template,


135
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,541 line:-1
or Command + E.


136
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,511 line:-2
This will export a 3.0 template
in monochrome


137
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,879 line:-1
so that I can customize it.


138
00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:23.717 line:-2 align:center
For symbols that originate
in the SF Symbols app,


139
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.619 line:-2 align:center
you have two options
for the initial setup


140
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:29,590 line:-2
of your 3.0 template:
static and variable.


141
00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:31.959 line:-2 align:center
Which setup you choose
depends on your design goals.


142
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,128 line:-2
The static setup
should be familiar,


143
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,664 line:-2
as it looks similar
to a 2.0 template.


144
00:06:38.098 --> 00:06:40.300 line:-2 align:center
There are 27 sets of paths
and one set


145
00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:43.504 line:-2 align:center
of explicit margins
on regular in the medium scale.


146
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,039 line:-2
If you are targeting
a particular weight and scale,


147
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,509 line:-2
or only plan on designing
one or two variants


148
00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:51.812 line:-2 align:center
of your symbol,
this setup will work well.


149
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,881 line:-2
The variable setup,
on the other hand,


150
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,783 line:-2
will generate a 3.0 template
that has three sets


151
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,753 line:-2
of paths
and three sets of margins.


152
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,556 line:-2
If you plan on supporting
all design variants,


153
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.058 line:-2 align:center
you may be interested
in starting with this setup,


154
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,426 line:-2
since it gives you
the minimum number


155
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,830 line:-2
of design variants
needed to generate the other 24.


156
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.965 line:-2 align:center
This requires
that all your paths


157
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:15,302 line:-2
have a very high level of
compatibility and consistency.


158
00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:19.072 line:-1 align:center
But don't worry about this now.


159
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,241 line:-2
We'll revisit these requirements
and this setup


160
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,877 line:-1
of the template later in detail.


161
00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:26.613 line:-2 align:center
For now,
I'll export a static setup


162
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,917 line:-2
since I'm only going to draw
one or two variants.


163
00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:32.553 line:-2 align:center
With my template open
in my design application,


164
00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:34.321 line:-1 align:center
I'm ready to begin editing.


165
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,558 line:-2
Like working
with a 2.0 template,


166
00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:39.426 line:-2 align:center
I can delete design variants
I don't need


167
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.595 line:-1 align:center
and only design a few to start.


168
00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:45.365 line:-2 align:center
For templates that don't
have compatible paths,


169
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,467 line:-2
Regular-Medium
is still required,


170
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:49.570 line:-1 align:center
so I'll start with that.


171
00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:52.239 line:-1 align:center
I'll make room for the heart


172
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,741 line:-2
on the middle spire
of the crown.


173
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,978 line:-2
And I want this symbol
to look good in multicolor mode,


174
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.480 line:-2 align:center
so I'll adjust the paths
so that I can assign colors


175
00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:03.450 line:-2 align:center
to particular parts
of my symbol later.


176
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:06.587 line:-2 align:center
With these adjustments,
I now have a single closed shape


177
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.256 line:-2 align:center
for the hollow part
of the crown.


178
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,191 line:-1
Next, I'll focus on the heart.


179
00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:15.562 line:-2 align:center
Now, as I edit my symbol,
I may use strokes to match


180
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,664 line:-2
the stem thickness
of Regular-Medium


181
00:08:17.698 --> 00:08:20.000 line:-2 align:center
since I am working
on a stroked symbol.


182
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,169 line:-2
This gives me flexibility
as I iterate


183
00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:24.271 line:-2 align:center
on the proportions
and size of the heart.


184
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,140 line:-2
But notice,
I make sure to convert


185
00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:30.978 line:-2 align:center
any live strokes to paths
once I'm happy with the design.


186
00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:33.714 line:-2 align:center
Converting to paths
ensures that the stroked shapes


187
00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:36.316 line:-1 align:center
can be filled with color later.


188
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.785 line:-2 align:center
Another benefit
of converting to paths


189
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,455 line:-2
is that I can make some
minor optical adjustments


190
00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:43.757 line:-2 align:center
for when a stroke
isn't precise enough.


191
00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:46.226 line:-2 align:center
Like here,
on the top half of the heart,


192
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.596 line:-2 align:center
the stroke is too large
and round on the inside.


193
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.798 line:-1 align:center
Since I converted to paths,


194
00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:54.168 line:-2 align:center
I can fine tune the curve
to look less clunky.


195
00:08:56.603 --> 00:08:58.772 line:-2 align:center
Now that I have
one design variant drawn,


196
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,941 line:-2
this is a good time to talk
about some items


197
00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:02.643 line:-2 align:center
to keep in mind
if you want your symbol


198
00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:05.379 line:-2 align:center
to support rendering modes
other than monochrome.


199
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:10,517 line:-2
Avoid using live strokes
in the final design.


200
00:09:10.551 --> 00:09:13.020 line:-2 align:center
Instead, make sure
to convert any strokes


201
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.122 line:-2 align:center
to paths
so that the resulting shapes


202
00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:17.257 line:-2 align:center
can take on colors
or hierarchy groups.


203
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,628 line:-1
Avoid using open paths.


204
00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:23.564 line:-2 align:center
These are paths
that have a start point


205
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,066 line:-2
and an end point
that do not connect.


206
00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:27.835 line:-2 align:center
Since there's
no closed fill area,


207
00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:31.138 line:-2 align:center
these shapes will be unable
to take on any colors.


208
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,707 line:-2
Instead, make sure
all shapes in your design


209
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,310 line:-2
are closed
with a defined fill area.


210
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:41,014 line:-2
Avoid special fills
involving more than one color


211
00:09:41.048 --> 00:09:44.785 line:-2 align:center
such as gradients
or effects like drop shadows.


212
00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:46.987 line:-2 align:center
If these are present,
they will override


213
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.056 line:-2 align:center
any multicolor
or hierarchical data


214
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,991 line:-1
you create for your symbol.


215
00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:54.294 line:-2 align:center
Instead,
stick to standard, flat fills


216
00:09:54.328 --> 00:09:56.663 line:-1 align:center
with no additional effects.


217
00:09:56.663 --> 00:09:58.498 line:-2 align:center
Now, if we jump back
to my design tool,


218
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,033 line:-1
the template is pretty bare.


219
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,670 line:-2
I may want to add semibold
so that the symbol


220
00:10:03.704 --> 00:10:05.639 line:-2 align:center
responds to
the accessibility bold feature


221
00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:07.307 line:-1 align:center
on iOS.


222
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,244 line:-2
To do this, it's recommend
to copy an existing drawing


223
00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:14.181 line:-2 align:center
you have to the desired layer
and adjust it from there.


224
00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:18.151 line:-2 align:center
This is a good habit to get into
as it will result


225
00:10:18.185 --> 00:10:20.020 line:-2 align:center
in the same number of paths
being used


226
00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:21.755 line:-1 align:center
across your design variants.


227
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,559 line:0
Preserving the number
of paths


228
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:26,927 line:0
across all design variants


229
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,096 line:0
is a requirement
if you want to produce


230
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,899 align:center
a symbol with multicolor
or hierarchical data.


231
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,536 line:0
In this example,
I've colored the paths


232
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,905 align:center
to indicate their number
and order.


233
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,274 align:center
Both design variants
have four paths.


234
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,943 align:center
The first two paths
make up the folder,


235
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,912 align:center
then we have a circle
as the third path,


236
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,047 align:center
and a plus sign
as the fourth path.


237
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,919 align:center
As a result, these two drawings
look great in multicolor.


238
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:57,257 line:0
These drawings
also have four paths present,


239
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,794 line:0
but, if you pay close attention,
you'll notice I've shuffled


240
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,663 align:center
the order
of the paths on the right.


241
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:07,634 align:center
The main stroke of the folder
is the first path in the drawing


242
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,536 line:0
on the left,


243
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,006 line:0
but the third path
in the drawing on the right.


244
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,776 align:center
When designs have
the same number of paths


245
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,277 align:center
but in different orders,


246
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:19,112 align:center
they are likely
to render very differently.


247
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,516 align:center
And if we were to render
these drawings


248
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,519 align:center
in multicolor,
they don't match up.


249
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,188 align:center
The green of the plus badge
is being applied to the folder


250
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:29,723 line:0
in the design variant
on the right.


251
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,594 line:-1
Back to the Queen.heart symbol.


252
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,562 line:-1
It looks great so far.


253
00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:38.532 line:-2 align:center
And since I was careful in how
I created my design variants,


254
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,868 line:-2
I can make it even better
by annotating it


255
00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:43.370 line:-2 align:center
to support multicolor
and hierarchical modes.


256
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,641 line:-2
Before I can do that,
I'll need to import


257
00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:49.877 line:-1 align:center
my symbol back into the app.


258
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,246 line:-2
I can simply drop it
on the existing cell


259
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,982 line:-2
we have to update it
in the SF Symbols app.


260
00:11:56.583 --> 00:11:59.486 line:-2 align:center
Now, you're not required
to annotate your symbols,


261
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,522 line:-2
but if you want to control
your symbol's appearance


262
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,657 line:-2
in rendering modes
other than monochrome,


263
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.292 line:-1 align:center
it's a good idea.


264
00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:09.830 line:-2 align:center
To annotate,
you'll use the individual paths


265
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,599 line:-2
that make up your symbol
as your building blocks.


266
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,104 line:-2
From these,
you create a set of layers


267
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:19,439 line:-1
for each rendering mode.


268
00:12:19.473 --> 00:12:21.909 line:-2 align:center
A layer is simply
a collection of paths


269
00:12:21.942 --> 00:12:24.678 line:-2 align:center
with some
associated rendering data.


270
00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:27.614 line:-2 align:center
Here I have a layer
for the crown with seven paths,


271
00:12:27.648 --> 00:12:30.050 line:-2 align:center
and a layer
for the heart with two paths.


272
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,556 line:-2
Layers in multicolor mode
get assigned a color,


273
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,692 line:-2
and layers in hierarchical mode
get assigned a hierarchy group.


274
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:44,498 line:-2
Layers have an explicit z-order
where the layers on top


275
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,000 line:-2
will block out
the layers below.


276
00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:48.902 line:-2 align:center
This is no different
from creating layers


277
00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:50.470 line:-1 align:center
in a design application.


278
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,574 line:-2
To begin annotating,
I select my symbol


279
00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:56.210 line:-2 align:center
in the app
and enter the gallery view.


280
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.445 line:-1 align:center
In the inspector on the right,


281
00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:00.814 line:-2 align:center
I can select
the rendering mode tab


282
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:03,116 line:-2
so I can preview
and annotate my symbol.


283
00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:07.054 line:-1 align:center
I can choose between monochrome,


284
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:10,457 line:-2
hierarchical,
palette, and multicolor.


285
00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:12.860 line:-2 align:center
When in a mode
other than monochrome,


286
00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:15.095 line:-2 align:center
you will be able
to add and edit your layers


287
00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.830 line:-2 align:center
corresponding
to the active mode.


288
00:13:18.532 --> 00:13:20.934 line:-2 align:center
And in the center
we have our preview.


289
00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:22.803 line:-2 align:center
Here we can interact
with all the paths


290
00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:25.772 line:-2 align:center
we have at our disposal
and assign them to layers.


291
00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:29.843 line:-2 align:center
I'll start with the multicolor
rendering mode first.


292
00:13:32.212 --> 00:13:34.381 line:-2 align:center
I'll create
a new layer for the crown.


293
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,319 line:-2
Then, I can select
a color for the layer.


294
00:13:39.353 --> 00:13:41.054 line:-2 align:center
For multicolor layers,
I can choose


295
00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:45.692 line:-2 align:center
from various system colors,
or use my own custom color.


296
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:48,128 line:-2
It's recommended
to use system-provided colors


297
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,964 line:-2
whenever possible,
as they will adapt to changes


298
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,067 line:-2
in the system's appearance
to look great in light mode,


299
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:58,939 line:-2
dark mode, high contrast modes,
and different vibrancy contexts.


300
00:13:58.972 --> 00:14:01.508 line:-2 align:center
I'll use system yellow
for the crown.


301
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:06,914 line:-2
And that's one layer done.
Now, just for the heart.


302
00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:09.316 line:-2 align:center
I'll add that
on its own layer in red.


303
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,954 line:-2
I want to add a bit more depth
to my crown in multicolor mode


304
00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:15.822 line:-2 align:center
by setting colors
on the hollow parts


305
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:16,857 line:-1
of my symbol.


306
00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:21.128 line:-2 align:center
A path can be used
in any number of layers.


307
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:23.964 line:-2 align:center
So, to achieve a stroked
and filled effect,


308
00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:25.199 line:-1 align:center
I've added a layer


309
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,201 line:-2
with the paths
that I want transparent


310
00:14:27.201 --> 00:14:29.002 line:-2 align:center
and set it
to a lower opacity.


311
00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:34.074 line:-2 align:center
I'll do the same
for the heart as well.


312
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,743 line:-1
That looks great.


313
00:14:36.777 --> 00:14:38.612 line:-2 align:center
Next,
I'll move onto hierarchical.


314
00:14:40.013 --> 00:14:42.316 line:-2 align:center
I can construct
my layers like before,


315
00:14:42.349 --> 00:14:46.286 line:-2 align:center
but instead of colors,
I assign hierarchical groups


316
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.022 line:-2 align:center
ranging from
primary to tertiary.


317
00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:51.124 line:-2 align:center
The hierarchical data
will be used


318
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,794 line:-2
in the hierarchical
and palette rendering modes.


319
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,898 line:-2
I'll add a layer
for my crown in secondary.


320
00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:00.934 line:-1 align:center
And the heart in primary.


321
00:15:02.035 --> 00:15:03.637 line:-2 align:center
I can see
in the preview that a bit


322
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,472 line:-2
of the crown
shows through the heart


323
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:07,074 line:-1
where they overlap


324
00:15:07.107 --> 00:15:09.343 line:-2 align:center
because the heart
isn't fully opaque.


325
00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:11.078 line:-2 align:center
This is a common problem
when working


326
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,446 line:-1
with overlapping shapes.


327
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,783 line:-2
To control how these overlaps
get rendered,


328
00:15:16.817 --> 00:15:18.952 line:-2 align:center
each layer
has a toggle on the right.


329
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,458 align:center
If inactive,
transparent layers will blend


330
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,160 line:0
with the layers below,
as shown on the left.


331
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,329 line:0
This is the default behavior.


332
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:30,998 line:0
If active,
transparent layers


333
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:33,066 align:center
will clear what's behind them


334
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,501 line:0
and render
as if the other layers


335
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:36,703 align:center
don't exist,
as shown on the right.


336
00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:40.741 line:-2 align:center
With the clear behind
toggle set,


337
00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:43.277 line:-2 align:center
now my symbol
behaves as expected.


338
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,913 line:-2
The hierarchical annotation data
also gets used


339
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,315 line:-2
by the palette rendering mode,
so I'll make sure


340
00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:50.751 line:-2 align:center
our layer interaction
looks good there as well.


341
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,954 line:-1
This looks great.


342
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,523 line:-2
The cyan layer is transparent
but since clear behind


343
00:15:56.557 --> 00:16:00.060 line:-2 align:center
is enabled, we can't see any
of the indigo crown behind it.


344
00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:03.897 line:-2 align:center
In the palette rendering mode,
I can assign two to three colors


345
00:16:03.931 --> 00:16:06.700 line:-2 align:center
to my symbol,
instead of just one


346
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,769 line:-1
like in hierarchical.


347
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,438 line:-2
Let's review the difference
in how these two modes interpret


348
00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.208 line:-2 align:center
hierarchical annotations
to apply color.


349
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,713 line:0
Hierarchical uses one color
and will apply it


350
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:20,948 align:center
to your symbol's layers,


351
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:24,151 align:center
varying the opacity
based on the hierarchy level.


352
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:27,087 line:0
In this case, we have a symbol
with a primary group


353
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,889 line:0
and a tertiary group.


354
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:31,391 align:center
Palette takes
two to three colors,


355
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,694 align:center
and the behavior
will differ slightly


356
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,530 line:0
based on the number
of colors passed.


357
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,899 line:0
Passing two colors
will distribute the colors


358
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:41,068 align:center
among the available
hierarchy groups


359
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,036 line:0
regardless of their level.


360
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,340 align:center
For this symbol,
since we only have two groups,


361
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,775 line:0
the first color is applied
to the primary group


362
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,111 line:0
and the second color is applied
to the tertiary group.


363
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,749 align:center
If you pass three colors,
then each one is applied


364
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,552 align:center
to the corresponding
hierarchy group.


365
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:01,188 align:center
The first color
is assigned to primary,


366
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:04,191 align:center
the second to secondary,
and third to tertiary.


367
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,795 line:-2
If you need
to continue editing a symbol


368
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.364 line:-1 align:center
you've already annotated,


369
00:17:10.397 --> 00:17:11.798 line:-1 align:center
you would export a template


370
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,534 line:-2
and edit
the monochrome representation


371
00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:15.235 line:-1 align:center
in your design tool.


372
00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:17.604 line:-2 align:center
Then reimport the symbol
and verify


373
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:20,507 line:-2
your annotations
still render as expected.


374
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,177 line:0
Special care must be taken
when modifying


375
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,112 line:0
the paths
of an annotated symbol


376
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:28,248 line:0
if you wish to retain
your annotation data.


377
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:30,584 align:center
Since this data requires
the same number of paths


378
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:34,821 line:0
across designs, you can safely
add, remove, and adjust points.


379
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,693 align:center
But removing or reordering
whole paths


380
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,261 align:center
will make your design
go out of sync


381
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:43,430 line:0
with its annotation data.


382
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,566 align:center
In these cases,
you will need to reannotate


383
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,802 align:center
the symbol to account
for its new path structure.


384
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:51,805 line:-2
Now, I have my symbol
in two design variants,


385
00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:53.774 line:-2 align:center
and it's annotated
so it will look great


386
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,909 line:-1
in other rendering modes.


387
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:58,579 line:-2
I could stop here,
but what if I need to support


388
00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:01.481 line:-2 align:center
other combinations
of scale and weight?


389
00:18:01.515 --> 00:18:03.784 line:-2 align:center
In this section,
we'll talk about techniques


390
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,420 line:-2
for working with custom symbols
that can save you time


391
00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:09.356 line:-2 align:center
if you plan on drawing
three or more design variants.


392
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,393 line:-2
In the past, I would continue
filling out the rest


393
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,096 line:-2
of the variants
in the template one by one,


394
00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:19.466 line:-2 align:center
adjusting the paths to match
the desired weight and scale.


395
00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:21.735 line:-1 align:center
But now, with SF Symbols 3,


396
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,071 line:-2
there's a much better way
to do this.


397
00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:26.907 line:-2 align:center
If you provide
just three design variants


398
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.575 line:-1 align:center
with compatible data,


399
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,278 line:-2
you get the rest
of the template for free.


400
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,447 line:-2
This is the structure
of the SVG you will get


401
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,983 line:-2
when asking
for a 3.0 variable template.


402
00:18:35.983 --> 00:18:37.751 line:-1 align:center
Let's dive into the requirements


403
00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.720 line:-2 align:center
for producing
compatible designs.


404
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.255 line:-1 align:center
First, we check


405
00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:44.157 line:-2 align:center
for what we refer to
as design sources.


406
00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:46.159 line:-1 align:center
These are Ultralight-Small,


407
00:18:46.193 --> 00:18:49.162 line:-1 align:center
Regular-Small, and Black-Small.


408
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:51,565 line:-2
If those are present,
then paths are assessed


409
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,701 line:-2
across the sources
to see if they match up.


410
00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:57.104 line:-2 align:center
Let's focus
on the Regular-Small source


411
00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.339 line:-2 align:center
and the Black-Small source
for a comparison.


412
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,977 line:0
Across design variants,
all paths must have


413
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,712 line:0
the same number and order


414
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:09,483 line:0
exactly as we discussed earlier
with annotation requirements.


415
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,585 line:0
I've colored the paths
of the crown here


416
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,554 line:0
to indicate their order.


417
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,756 line:0
There are nine paths,
and they all match up.


418
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,826 line:0
For example,
the two paths for the heart


419
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,330 align:center
are the eighth and ninth path
in both design variants.


420
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,499 align:center
So far, so good.


421
00:19:25.532 --> 00:19:28.335 line:-2 align:center
Next, we'll check inside
the corresponding paths


422
00:19:28.368 --> 00:19:30.504 line:-1 align:center
across design variants.


423
00:19:30.537 --> 00:19:32.406 line:-2 align:center
Let's compare the outside path
for the heart


424
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,742 line:-2
of the regular source
and the black source.


425
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:39,346 line:-2
Each path is constructed
from a series of points.


426
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,416 line:-2
We have 24 points
for the regular source in red,


427
00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:45.385 line:-2 align:center
and 24 points
for the black source in blue.


428
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,324 line:-2
To be compatible,
points must match one-to-one


429
00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:53.227 line:-1 align:center
between the corresponding paths.


430
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,264 line:-2
Each pair of matching points
create an imaginary line,


431
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,600 line:-2
and moving each point
along its respective line


432
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:02,369 line:-2
allows us to blend between
the two compatible paths.


433
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,039 line:-2
Since each point
in the regular source


434
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,208 line:-2
corresponds to a point
in the black source,


435
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:09,409 line:-1
we can do just that.


436
00:20:10.677 --> 00:20:12.279 line:-2 align:center
We'll focus in
on the smaller heart


437
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,348 line:-1
in red and observe the path


438
00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.683 line:-2 align:center
as it blends
with the larger heart in blue.


439
00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:21.388 line:-2 align:center
Blending is what allows
for a new path


440
00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:24.691 line:-2 align:center
to be generated anywhere
between the compatible paths.


441
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,661 line:-2
This blending is known
as "interpolation."


442
00:20:27.694 --> 00:20:29.596 line:-2 align:center
Now that we know
how interpolation works


443
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.633 line:-2 align:center
at the point level,
let's zoom out


444
00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:34.334 line:-2 align:center
and apply it
to the entire symbol.


445
00:20:36.703 --> 00:20:39.072 line:-2 align:center
You'll notice that any weight
between ultralight,


446
00:20:39.106 --> 00:20:41.508 line:-2 align:center
regular,
and black can be computed.


447
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,912 line:-2
This is the mechanism
for the weight compensation


448
00:20:44.945 --> 00:20:46.313 line:-1 align:center
necessary to generate


449
00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:48.348 line:-2 align:center
the medium and large scale
design variants


450
00:20:48.382 --> 00:20:49.516 line:-1 align:center
for your symbols.


451
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,289 line:-1
Let's recap those requirements.


452
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,691 line:-2
For a symbol to be considered
interpolatable,


453
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,026 line:-1
it needs three things.


454
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.462 line:-1 align:center
First, the three design sources.


455
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:05,532 line:-2
Ultralight-Small,
Regular-Small, and Black-Small.


456
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,602 line:-1
Second, path compatibility.


457
00:21:09.703 --> 00:21:12.906 line:-2 align:center
All paths must match
between the sources.


458
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,943 line:-1
And lastly, point compatibility.


459
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:19,213 line:-2
All matching paths must have
the same number of points.


460
00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:23.050 line:-2 align:center
So how would I go about
making one of these


461
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,751 line:-1
interpolatable symbols?


462
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:28,155 line:-2
Well, instead of a static setup,
I would start by exporting


463
00:21:28.188 --> 00:21:30.557 line:-2 align:center
a 3.0 template
from the SF Symbols app


464
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:32,626 line:-1
with a variable setup.


465
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,695 line:-2
This way,
I have margins and outlines


466
00:21:34.728 --> 00:21:36.263 line:-1 align:center
for the three source designs.


467
00:21:37.831 --> 00:21:41.735 line:-2 align:center
I would start with Regular-Small
and add my heart on top,


468
00:21:41.768 --> 00:21:44.404 line:-2 align:center
as we did earlier
for Regular-Medium.


469
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:46,473 line:-2
This time it is just
for a smaller scale.


470
00:21:47.674 --> 00:21:50.444 line:-2 align:center
Since interpolation
has very strict requirements,


471
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,578 line:-1
it's recommended to get


472
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,313 line:-2
the initial
Regular-Small design variant


473
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:56,216 line:-2
into good shape before working
on the other sources.


474
00:21:57.751 --> 00:21:59.753 line:-2 align:center
When you do go to work
on the Ultralight-Small


475
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:02,256 line:-2
and Black-Small sources,
it is best to copy


476
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:04,925 line:-2
and paste
the Regular-Small paths


477
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,461 line:-2
and only reposition
the points from there.


478
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:12,499 line:-2
This is critical to make sure
your custom symbol


479
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:16,036 line:-2
is capable of generating
the other design variants.


480
00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:17.771 line:-2 align:center
So let's
review that one more time.


481
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,909 line:0
When you want your symbol
to be interpolatable,


482
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:24,144 line:0
avoid adding or removing points,


483
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,913 line:0
as this will break
compatibility.


484
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,917 line:0
Instead, only adjust
the existing points.


485
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,653 line:0
Moving points
and control points is fine,


486
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,354 line:0
since this preserves
the compatibility


487
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:35,722 line:0
between designs.


488
00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:40.561 line:-2 align:center
Once ready,
I can drop my updated template


489
00:22:40.594 --> 00:22:42.963 line:-2 align:center
on my custom symbols cell
in the app,


490
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:46,033 line:-2
and annotate it
just like I did before.


491
00:22:46.066 --> 00:22:48.302 line:-2 align:center
Since I was careful
in drawing my sources,


492
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:50,571 line:-2
I have
all 27 variants covered,


493
00:22:50.604 --> 00:22:53.674 line:-2 align:center
and I'm all set to hand this off
to get implemented.


494
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:55,475 line:-2
Now that we've covered
ways to create


495
00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:58.545 line:-2 align:center
your custom symbol,
let's talk about next steps


496
00:22:58.579 --> 00:23:00.714 line:-2 align:center
such as how
to distribute your symbol.


497
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:04,418 line:0
When distributing your symbol,
you have two options.


498
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:07,788 align:center
You can export a 2.0 template
or a 3.0 template.


499
00:23:09.656 --> 00:23:11.925 line:-2 align:center
2.0 templates
should only be used


500
00:23:11.959 --> 00:23:16.330 line:-2 align:center
if you plan on back deploying
to an older OS such as iOS 14.


501
00:23:16.363 --> 00:23:18.832 line:-2 align:center
It only contains monochrome
so make sure


502
00:23:18.866 --> 00:23:21.134 line:-2 align:center
your symbol makes sense
when used in that mode.


503
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:26,340 line:-2
Converting to a 2.0 template
is a lossy operation.


504
00:23:26.373 --> 00:23:29.476 line:-2 align:center
Annotation data
and explicit margins are removed


505
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,879 line:-2
since the older OS
will not understand them.


506
00:23:33.313 --> 00:23:36.683 line:-2 align:center
3.0 can embed all the multicolor
and hierarchical data


507
00:23:36.717 --> 00:23:40.254 line:-2 align:center
you've added,
as well as any custom margins,


508
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:42,222 line:-2
but it is
not backwards compatible.


509
00:23:43.323 --> 00:23:45.359 line:-2 align:center
Careful here,
this template is not


510
00:23:45.392 --> 00:23:47.728 line:-1 align:center
a source artifact for editing.


511
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,464 line:-2
Current design tools
may not be entirely compatible


512
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:52,566 line:-2
with the embedded
annotation data.


513
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,701 line:-2
If you need to make
more edits to your symbol


514
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,236 line:-1
or share it with a colleague,


515
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,239 line:-2
it should be imported
back into the SF Symbols app.


516
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:00,507 line:-1
From there, you can work


517
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:03,110 line:-2
on the monochrome representation
without risk


518
00:24:03.143 --> 00:24:04.711 line:-1 align:center
of dropping your annotations.


519
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:08,916 line:-2
The 3.0 template that you export
should go


520
00:24:08.949 --> 00:24:13.220 line:-2 align:center
straight to Xcode
or back to the SF Symbols app.


521
00:24:13.253 --> 00:24:16.823 line:-2 align:center
If your minimum
deployment target is iOS 14,


522
00:24:16.857 --> 00:24:21.094 line:-2 align:center
you will need to export both
a 2.0 and a 3.0 template


523
00:24:21.128 --> 00:24:23.864 line:-2 align:center
and use the appropriate asset
based on a version check.


524
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,533 line:-2
If your minimum
deployment target


525
00:24:26.567 --> 00:24:28.769 line:-1 align:center
is iOS15 or later,


526
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,904 line:-2
you only need to export
a 3.0 template.


527
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,007 line:-1
If you are sharing a symbol


528
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:37.144 line:-2 align:center
with a colleague,
export a 3.0 template.


529
00:24:37.177 --> 00:24:39.847 line:-2 align:center
They can then import
that into their SF Symbols app


530
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,749 line:-2
to continue
editing and annotating.


531
00:24:42.783 --> 00:24:44.751 line:-2 align:center
We covered
a lot of content today,


532
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:46,920 line:-1
so let's do a quick recap.


533
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.624 line:-2 align:center
We talked about the new
3.0 custom symbol template,


534
00:24:50.657 --> 00:24:53.760 line:-2 align:center
the features it supports,
and how to edit it.


535
00:24:54.528 --> 00:24:57.431 line:-2 align:center
We covered how to prepare
your symbols for annotation


536
00:24:57.898 --> 00:25:00.334 line:-2 align:center
and add multicolor
and hierarchical data.


537
00:25:01.602 --> 00:25:03.737 line:-2 align:center
We explored
a more advanced workflow


538
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:05,973 line:-2
that opts into
some stricter requirements


539
00:25:05.973 --> 00:25:08.408 line:-2 align:center
to take advantage
of interpolation.


540
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:10,310 line:-2
And we just
finished talking about


541
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,346 line:-1
how to distribute your symbols.


542
00:25:13.814 --> 00:25:15.349 line:-2 align:center
Once you've delivered
your symbols,


543
00:25:15.382 --> 00:25:17.851 line:-2 align:center
they are ready to be used
by the OS.


544
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:19,586 line:-2
There are some new APIs
you can use


545
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.488 line:-2 align:center
for rendering your symbol
in the appropriate mode.


546
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,892 line:-2
To learn more
about calling SF Symbols


547
00:25:24.925 --> 00:25:26.960 line:-1 align:center
and custom symbols in code,


548
00:25:26,994 --> 00:25:30,564 align:center
check out "SF Symbols
in UIKit and AppKit"


549
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:35,669 align:center
and "SF Symbols in SwiftUI,"
both from WWDC 2021.


550
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:38.071 line:-2 align:center
That's custom symbols
from start to finish.


551
00:25:38.105 --> 00:25:41.275 line:-2 align:center
I hope you enjoy creating
and annotating your own symbols.
