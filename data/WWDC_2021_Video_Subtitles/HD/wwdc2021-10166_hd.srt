00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,845 line:-1
[Victoria] Hi, I'm Victoria.


4
00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:14.515 line:-2 align:center
I'm an engineer on
the Documentation Tools team


5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,849 line:-1
here at Apple,


6
00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.151 line:-2 align:center
and together
with my colleague Ethan,


7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,853 line:-2
we're going
to give you an introduction


8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.423 line:-2 align:center
to the new documentation
features in Xcode 13.


9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,727 line:-2
There are new ways to read
and write documentation


10
00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:29.029 line:-2 align:center
that both fit
right into your workflow


11
00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:32.099 line:-2 align:center
and unlock new possibilities
for your development.


12
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:36,470 line:-2
Xcode 13 has new features
to build, write,


13
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,173 line:-2
and browse documentation
for Swift frameworks


14
00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.641 line:-1 align:center
and packages.


15
00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.709 line:-1 align:center
This unlocks a powerful mode


16
00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.912 line:-2 align:center
of documentation-driven
development


17
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,247 line:-2
where you can read all about
your Swift dependencies


18
00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.349 line:-1 align:center
while you write your code.


19
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,886 line:-2
This documentation lives right
alongside the platform libraries


20
00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:56.490 line:-2 align:center
in the Developer Documentation
window right in Xcode.


21
00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:59.226 line:-2 align:center
In this session,
we'll give an overview


22
00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:03.597 line:-2 align:center
of the documentation
features in Xcode 13,


23
00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:06.200 line:-2 align:center
walk you through
building documentation


24
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.068 line:-2 align:center
for the Swift frameworks
and packages


25
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,170 line:-1
you're writing and using,


26
00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.506 line:-2 align:center
show you how you can use
Xcode 13


27
00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:15.309 line:-1 align:center
to write great documentation,


28
00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.711 line:-2 align:center
and finish up by
showing off the ways


29
00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:20.948 line:-2 align:center
you can share documentation
with Xcode 13.


30
00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:24.051 line:-2 align:center
Let's get started
with why I'm personally excited


31
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,587 line:-2
about the new documentation
features.


32
00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.655 line:-1 align:center
I'm sure we've all been there.


33
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,892 line:-2
There's some new framework
or package that we want to use,


34
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,795 line:-2
but when it comes time
to integrate it into our code,


35
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,431 line:-2
we need to figure out
what all comes in it.


36
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,467 line:-1
This is where Xcode 13 steps in.


37
00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:44.071 line:-2 align:center
Now Xcode comes with a compiler
for your documentation


38
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,739 line:-1
as well as your code,


39
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,408 line:-2
and you can build
and view documentation


40
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:52,513 line:-2
for Swift frameworks
and packages all inside Xcode.


41
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,948 line:-1
We call it DocC,


42
00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:57.651 line:-2 align:center
and we've integrated it
all throughout Xcode


43
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:01,688 line:-2
to enhance the way you read
and write documentation.


44
00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:05.659 line:-2 align:center
Now, DocC is more than just
a documentation compiler


45
00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:07.394 line:-1 align:center
run after the fact.


46
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:10.230 line:-2 align:center
It's a fully integrated
documentation environment


47
00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:14.168 line:-2 align:center
that complements Xcode,
offering a rich,


48
00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.471 line:-2 align:center
live environment with your docs
appearing in Quick Help,


49
00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:20.007 line:-1 align:center
rich code completion


50
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,975 line:-2
to allow you
to tie your docs together


51
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,810 line:-1
into a cohesive whole,


52
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,113 line:-1
full documentation available


53
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,416 line:-2
in the integrated Developer
Documentation window,


54
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,753 line:-2
and an easy option to share
pre-built documentation


55
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,357 line:-2
to view in Xcode and on the web,
just to name a few.


56
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:42,062 line:-2
Stay tuned for our other
DocC sessions at WWDC 2021,


57
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,899 line:-2
which will go over all these
in detail and much more.


58
00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:48.468 line:-1 align:center
DocC empowers you to write


59
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,838 line:-2
excellent reference
documentation,


60
00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.540 line:-2 align:center
leveraging
the power of Xcode and Swift


61
00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:57.177 line:-2 align:center
to give users a bird's-eye view
of the public APIs


62
00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:59.479 line:-1 align:center
in your framework or package,


63
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,016 line:-2
complete with the ability to
describe how APIs work together,


64
00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:05.018 line:-1 align:center
not just in isolation.


65
00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:06.854 line:-1 align:center
DocC enables you to write


66
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.857 line:-2 align:center
much more than great reference
documentation, though.


67
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,593 line:-2
There are two additional
ways to write documentation


68
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,096 line:-2
with DocC that we're excited
to show off this year.


69
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:20,334 align:center
Articles allow you to walk users
through the big picture


70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,270 line:0
behind your framework,
giving you an opportunity


71
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,039 line:0
to tie individual items
in your framework together


72
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,509 align:center
with a cohesive story.


73
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,679 line:0
And tutorials are a powerful
step-by-step walk-through


74
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:36,216 align:center
of writing a project
that uses your framework.


75
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,485 align:center
They allow you to go
much deeper


76
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,021 line:0
than reference
documentation or articles


77
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,490 line:0
by giving your users
a guided introduction


78
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,626 line:0
to your framework
from the ground up.


79
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,597 line:0
All of these authoring
experiences leverage and extend


80
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,000 align:center
the power and simplicity
of Markdown


81
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,135 line:0
to make authoring
your documentation


82
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,005 align:center
as fluid
as writing your code.


83
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,840 line:0
If you want to know more
about assembling


84
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,808 line:0
a documentation catalog


85
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,511 line:0
with articles and tutorials
outside your source code,


86
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,714 line:0
check out these sessions
at WWDC this year.


87
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:13,120 line:-2
And finally, we're releasing
DocC as Open Source


88
00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:15.956 line:-2 align:center
later this year,
alongside a web app


89
00:04:16.023 --> 00:04:17.291 line:-1 align:center
that allows you to host


90
00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.760 line:-2 align:center
your built documentation
archives on the web


91
00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.128 line:-1 align:center
so you can take advantage


92
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,230 line:-2
of these new
documentation workflows


93
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,332 line:-1
even outside of Xcode.


94
00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.334 line:-1 align:center
Now that you have a taste


95
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,404 line:-2
of the new documentation
features in Xcode 13,


96
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,208 line:-2
let's dive in and talk about
building your documentation


97
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,577 line:-1
with DocC in Xcode.


98
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,446 line:-2
Let's take a quick peek
under the hood first


99
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,548 line:-1
to see how it works.


100
00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.083 line:-1 align:center
To build your documentation,


101
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,519 line:-2
Xcode builds your framework
or package


102
00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:48.121 line:-2 align:center
and asks the compiler
to save information


103
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:52,392 line:-2
about its public APIs alongside
your compiled artifacts.


104
00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:58.265 line:-2 align:center
That public API information
is then handed to DocC,


105
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:01,869 line:0
which then combines it with
your documentation catalog


106
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,770 align:center
containing articles
and tutorials


107
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:07,508 align:center
written outside your source code
to create the final archive


108
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,444 align:center
containing
the compiled documentation.


109
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,946 align:center
To learn more about
documentation catalogs


110
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,048 line:0
and organizing your docs,


111
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,818 line:0
check out the “Elevate
your DocC Documentation


112
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,087 align:center
in Xcode” session.


113
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,123 align:center
And thanks to DocC's integration
with Xcode's build system,


114
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,560 line:0
this process repeats
for every Swift framework


115
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,630 line:0
and package that your
target depends on.


116
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,298 line:0
This way,
you have all your relevant


117
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,368 align:center
documentation all in one place.


118
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:39,339 line:-2
But what does this mean for your
day-to-day documentation needs?


119
00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:41.942 line:-2 align:center
There are three ways
to build documentation


120
00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.679 line:-2 align:center
for Swift frameworks
and packages in Xcode 13.


121
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,449 line:-2
To build
documentation on demand,


122
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,286 line:-2
there's a new
Build Documentation menu item


123
00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:55.222 line:-2 align:center
to compile
and load up your docs.


124
00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.791 line:-2 align:center
And if you're working on
a Swift framework


125
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,493 line:-2
and always want to
preview your documentation


126
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,796 line:-2
as you go, there's also
a new build setting


127
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:05.699 line:-2 align:center
to build docs
every time you compile.


128
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,902 line:-2
And for your
command-line and CI needs,


129
00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:13.607 line:-4 align:center
xcodebuild has a new command
to build documentation too.


130
00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:16.810 line:-4 align:center
This runs the same build
as selecting Build Documentation


131
00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:21.114 line:-4 align:center
in Xcode but using xcodebuild
on the command line.


132
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,084 line:-4
My colleague David
has much more information


133
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:27,621 line:-4
about automating documentation
workflows in the “Host


134
00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:31.124 line:-4 align:center
and Automate your DocC
Documentation” session.


135
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:33.360 line:-1 align:center
Let's see this in action.


136
00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:35.095 line:-2 align:center
My teammates have been
working on this package


137
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,464 line:-2
called SlothCreator,
which is all about


138
00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:40.801 line:-2 align:center
cataloging and customizing
cute little sloths.


139
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:45,038 line:-2
I want to try it out, so let's
see how that looks in Xcode 13.


140
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:49,476 line:-2
I've set up this app I've called
Slothy so I can use SlothCreator


141
00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:52.946 line:-2 align:center
to customize my sloths
and preview them as I go.


142
00:06:53.013 --> 00:06:56.149 line:-2 align:center
I've set up SlothCreator as
a dependency of my app already,


143
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,852 line:-2
but I want to see more
about what APIs it offers,


144
00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.388 line:-2 align:center
so let's
open up the Product menu...


145
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,461 line:-2
And select Build Documentation
to take a look.


146
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,335 align:center
And just like that,


147
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,871 line:0
the Developer Documentation
window opens,


148
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,606 align:center
and over in the Navigator,


149
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:23,343 align:center
I can expand my Slothy project
and the SlothCreator package


150
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,481 line:0
I'm working with to see
an overview in the Navigator.


151
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,317 line:-2
I'll load the SlothCreator
overview in the main view,


152
00:07:30.384 --> 00:07:32.853 line:-1 align:center
and if I scroll down,


153
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,322 line:-2
there's a list of types
and protocols available.


154
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.993 line:-2 align:center
Here I can see
this type called Habitat.


155
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,929 line:-2
Let's click on it
to load its page.


156
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,066 line:-2
There's some
good information here,


157
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,236 line:-2
but I wonder if anything
else has mentioned it.


158
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:52,906 line:-2
Let's select the Search field
up top and look for "habitat".


159
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,880 line:-2
It looks like a few different
things mention this.


160
00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:01.481 line:-2 align:center
Let's click
on this sleep method


161
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,517 line:-2
to bring up
its documentation page.


162
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,388 line:-2
This page is specific
to the sleep method,


163
00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:11.625 line:-2 align:center
but I'm curious what
type this is part of.


164
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,194 line:-2
Up in the jump bar
at the top of the window,


165
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.797 line:-2 align:center
I can see this is
part of the Sloth type.


166
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,036 line:-2
If I click this Sloth,
a pull-down menu appears,


167
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,005 line:-1
and if I click it again,


168
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,041 line:-2
I can open that type's
documentation page.


169
00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:31.411 line:-2 align:center
Now I'm getting a picture of how
all these APIs fit together.


170
00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:33.714 line:-1 align:center
So now we've had a chance


171
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,984 line:-2
to walk through the
documentation of SlothCreator.


172
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.021 line:-2 align:center
Let's rewind and take a look
to see how it got to that point.


173
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,524 line:-2
My colleague Ethan
will start off by showing


174
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.826 line:-2 align:center
some of the new features
in Xcode 13


175
00:08:45.893 --> 00:08:47.528 line:-1 align:center
to write great documentation.


176
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,329 line:-1
Take it away.


177
00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:51.298 line:-1 align:center
[Ethan] Thank you, Victoria.


178
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,268 line:-2
Now that we've gone over
Xcode 13's great support


179
00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:57.271 line:-2 align:center
for building
and browsing documentation,


180
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,239 line:-2
I'd like to show you
a few tricks


181
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,843 line:-2
to write even better
documentation with DocC.


182
00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.345 line:-1 align:center
DocC is designed around


183
00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:08.749 line:-2 align:center
the benefits
of in-source documentation.


184
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,618 line:-2
You write your documentation
right alongside your code,


185
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,687 line:-2
making it convenient
and easy to integrate


186
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,989 line:-2
with your existing
development workflow.


187
00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:19.393 line:-2 align:center
To add documentation
to a declaration,


188
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,429 line:-2
you just write a special kind
of comment directly above it.


189
00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:24.932 line:-2 align:center
This makes it easy to keep
your documentation in sync


190
00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:27.534 line:-2 align:center
with any code changes
you might make in the future.


191
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,469 line:-2
And, of course,
it will fit right in


192
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:32,506 line:-2
with your existing text-based
tooling, like Git diffs.


193
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:36.143 line:-2 align:center
You're likely already
annotating your source code


194
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.245 line:-2 align:center
with comments
to provide extra context


195
00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:40.781 line:-2 align:center
to future maintainers
of your codebase.


196
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:43,383 line:-2
In Swift and many other
languages, you write a comment


197
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,987 line:-2
by starting your line
with two forward slashes.


198
00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:50.390 line:-2 align:center
By writing these comments,
you've gone a long way


199
00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:52.693 line:-2 align:center
in helping future maintainers
to understand


200
00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.629 line:-2 align:center
and be productive
within your codebase.


201
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,297 line:-2
But what
if you want to help


202
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,867 line:-2
today's adopters
of your framework?


203
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,069 line:-2
This is what documentation
comments are for.


204
00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:04.171 line:-1 align:center
By writing a comment


205
00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:06.707 line:-2 align:center
that begins with
three forward slashes,


206
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.276 line:-2 align:center
you're telling the Swift
documentation compiler


207
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,578 line:-2
to associate the comment
with the declaration


208
00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:13.413 line:-1 align:center
immediately below it.


209
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.249 line:-2 align:center
The comment will be
included in the symbol's


210
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,251 line:-1
compiled documentation page


211
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:21,522 line:-2
and accessible to anyone
who imports your framework.


212
00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:23.991 line:-2 align:center
And if you prefer to use
block-style comments,


213
00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:26.593 line:-2 align:center
you can create a documentation
comment in that style


214
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.996 line:-2 align:center
by just including
an extra asterisk


215
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,931 line:-1
in the opening delimiter.


216
00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:33.267 line:-2 align:center
Let's see how this all
works in practice.


217
00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:36.670 line:-2 align:center
As Victoria mentioned,
over the last few months,


218
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,873 line:-2
we've been working
on the SlothCreator framework.


219
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,342 line:-2
SlothCreator is a Swift
package that provides


220
00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:46.313 line:-2 align:center
functionality for cataloging
and customizing cute sloths.


221
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.650 line:-2 align:center
As a developer of SlothCreator,
I want to be sure


222
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,252 line:-2
that there's an easy way for
any adopters of the framework


223
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,188 line:-2
to get started,
so I've been working on


224
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,756 line:-1
adding documentation comments


225
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,991 line:-2
to the parts
of the codebase I worked on.


226
00:10:58.058 --> 00:11:01.128 line:-2 align:center
In particular,
I want to be sure that every


227
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:04,464 line:-2
public API in SlothCreator
is well documented,


228
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,167 line:-2
because it's these API
that are accessible


229
00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:09.503 line:-2 align:center
to anyone
importing my framework.


230
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.938 line:-1 align:center
For the same reason,


231
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,574 line:-2
DocC only generates
documentation pages


232
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,942 line:-1
for the public


233
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,777 line:-2
and open symbols
in your framework.


234
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,313 line:-2
There's just a couple
of symbols in SlothCreator


235
00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:21.181 line:-1 align:center
that still need documenting.


236
00:11:21.248 --> 00:11:23.283 line:-2 align:center
Let's start
with this Food struct.


237
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.019 line:-2 align:center
I'll begin by adding
three forward slashes


238
00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:28.055 line:-1 align:center
above the type's declaration


239
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,558 line:-2
to create
a documentation comment.


240
00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:36.496 line:-2 align:center
And then I'll write that this is
"Food that a sloth can consume."


241
00:11:36.563 --> 00:11:39.299 line:-2 align:center
The first line of my
documentation comment


242
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,301 line:-2
will turn into
the symbol's summary,


243
00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.504 line:-2 align:center
but I'd like to add
some extra information


244
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.205 line:-1 align:center
with a discussion section.


245
00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:47.140 line:-2 align:center
I'll add one now
by adding a line break


246
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,910 line:-2
after my summary and then
adding some additional detail


247
00:11:49.977 --> 00:11:52.846 line:-2 align:center
about the kinds
of foods sloths love.


248
00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:56.350 line:-2 align:center
And because DocC has full
support for Markdown,


249
00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:58.118 line:-1 align:center
I can add a code example


250
00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:00.721 line:-2 align:center
using Markdown's
fenced code block syntax.


251
00:12:01.922 --> 00:12:02.956 line:-1 align:center
Great.


252
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:06,260 line:-2
I think this adds some really
helpful additional context


253
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,262 line:-1
around the Food struct.


254
00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:10.330 line:-2 align:center
Let's see how my documentation
is looking now


255
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,399 line:-1
by rebuilding documentation.


256
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:16,069 line:-2
I can do that by moving
my mouse up to the Product menu


257
00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:19.173 line:-2 align:center
and then selecting
Build Documentation.


258
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:24,678 line:-2
Xcode will now rebuild
SlothCreator's documentation


259
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,547 line:-2
alongside
the framework itself.


260
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,915 line:-1
And because I used


261
00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:30.384 line:-2 align:center
the Build Documentation
button for this build,


262
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.653 line:-2 align:center
when it's complete,
the documentation viewer


263
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,155 line:-2
will open with
my updated documentation.


264
00:12:35.222 --> 00:12:38.425 line:-2 align:center
But I'm actually interested
in going straight to the page


265
00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:41.495 line:-2 align:center
for the Food struct to review
the comment we just added.


266
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:44,431 line:-2
Fortunately, Xcode has
a feature called Quick Help


267
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,667 line:-1
that will let me do just that.


268
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,503 line:-2
Quick Help offers
a short summarized version


269
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,606 line:-2
of a symbol's documentation
right in the source editor.


270
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,578 line:-2
I can try it out now
by holding down the Option key


271
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:01,048 line:-2
and then clicking
on Food's declaration.


272
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,484 line:-2
But an adopter of SlothCreator
could open the same view


273
00:13:04.551 --> 00:13:07.855 line:-2 align:center
by option-clicking on any
reference to the Food struct


274
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,723 line:-1
in their code.


275
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.491 line:-2 align:center
So the comment we wrote
is right here


276
00:13:11.558 --> 00:13:14.061 line:-2 align:center
in the Summary
and Discussion sections.


277
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,797 line:-2
But if I'm looking for more
than the summarized view,


278
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:21,235 line:-2
new in Xcode 13 is the Open
in Developer Documentation link.


279
00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:23.837 line:-1 align:center
If I move my mouse


280
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,440 line:-2
to the bottom right-hand corner
of the Quick Help view


281
00:13:26.507 --> 00:13:30.644 line:-2 align:center
and click on Open
in Developer Documentation,


282
00:13:30.711 --> 00:13:32.379 line:-2 align:center
the documentation window
will launch


283
00:13:32.446 --> 00:13:34.448 line:-1 align:center
right to that symbol's page.


284
00:13:34.515 --> 00:13:36.350 line:-1 align:center
Awesome.


285
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,818 line:-1
There's one other symbol


286
00:13:37.885 --> 00:13:40.888 line:-2 align:center
that's still missing
documentation in SlothCreator.


287
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,257 line:-2
I'll open the Sloth file
by moving my mouse


288
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,427 line:-2
over to Xcode's Navigator
and clicking on the Sloth item.


289
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,964 line:-2
And if I scroll down,
I'm noticing that the Eat method


290
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,133 line:-2
still needs
a documentation comment.


291
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,835 line:-1
So let's take a quick look


292
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:57,771 line:-2
at the best way
of documenting methods.


293
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:00,474 line:-1
We start the same way,


294
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,176 line:-2
by adding a triple-slash
comment


295
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,545 line:-2
above the method's
declaration and adding text


296
00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:07.581 line:-2 align:center
that will make up
its documentation summary.


297
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:09,883 line:-2
But we should also
document specifically


298
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,286 line:-2
what we're expecting to be
passed as a parameter.


299
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.056 line:-2 align:center
We do this via
a Parameters section.


300
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:18,292 line:-2
You add a Parameters section
to your documentation


301
00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.427 line:-2 align:center
by writing
a Markdown list item


302
00:14:20.494 --> 00:14:22.229 line:-2 align:center
starting with
the word Parameter


303
00:14:22.296 --> 00:14:24.498 line:-2 align:center
followed by the name
of your method's parameter,


304
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:27,968 line:-2
a colon,
and then its documentation.


305
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,637 line:-2
You can add a Returns section
in a very similar way,


306
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:34,274 line:-2
this time by writing a Returns
delimiter followed by a colon


307
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,544 line:-2
and a description of what
your method returns.


308
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:41,281 line:-2
But what if your method
has multiple parameters?


309
00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:44.017 line:-2 align:center
In this case, the best
thing to do is to go from


310
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:48,055 line:-2
a singular Parameter delimiter
to a plural Parameters one.


311
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,690 line:-2
This works much the same
as the others


312
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,525 line:-2
except your parameter names
are written


313
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:54,828 line:-2
as children of the parent
Parameters delimiter.


314
00:14:54.895 --> 00:14:56.830 line:-2 align:center
So now that
we've gone over the basics,


315
00:14:56.897 --> 00:15:00.000 line:-2 align:center
let's document
the sloth Eat method.


316
00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:02.269 line:-2 align:center
Now, I could begin
the same way we did


317
00:15:02.336 --> 00:15:04.004 line:-2 align:center
when documenting
the Food struct


318
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,340 line:-2
by manually writing
a documentation comment


319
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.275 line:-2 align:center
beginning
with three forward slashes.


320
00:15:08.342 --> 00:15:11.044 line:-2 align:center
But since I'm documenting
a more complicated symbol,


321
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,814 line:-2
I'm going to take
advantage of Xcode's great


322
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:16,950 line:-2
Add Documentation feature
which will insert a template


323
00:15:17.017 --> 00:15:19.920 line:-2 align:center
best-suited for documenting
the current declaration.


324
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:24,224 line:-2
I can do this by holding
down the Command key


325
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:27.094 line:-2 align:center
and then clicking on
the method's declaration


326
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,496 line:-1
to open the Action menu.


327
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,865 align:center
Next, I can click
on Add Documentation


328
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,635 line:0
in the Action menu
and, just like that,


329
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:38,105 line:0
I have a great template to get
started documenting my method.


330
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:43,010 line:0
I'll begin by filling out
the method's summary,


331
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:47,581 line:0
and then I'll describe the
food and quantity parameters


332
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:50,450 align:center
as well as
what this method returns.


333
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:53,820 line:0
And then I'll finish off
the documentation by adding


334
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,957 line:0
a Discussion section
along with a code example.


335
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,161 line:-2
Just like last time,
I can rebuild documentation


336
00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:03.463 line:-2 align:center
by moving my mouse
to the Product menu


337
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.999 line:-2 align:center
and selecting
the Build Documentation item.


338
00:16:08.702 --> 00:16:11.171 line:-2 align:center
And once again, Xcode
is building my documentation


339
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,640 line:-2
alongside
the framework itself.


340
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,610 line:-2
This time, I'll navigate
to the Sloth struct


341
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:18,545 line:-1
via the window's Navigator,


342
00:16:18.612 --> 00:16:21.882 line:-2 align:center
where I'll find Sloth
in the Sloths topic group.


343
00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:24.985 line:-2 align:center
If I scroll
down on the Sloth page,


344
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:28,889 line:-2
I'll find my method in the
Instance Methods section...


345
00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.760 line:-2 align:center
Along with my updated
documentation.


346
00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:35.729 line:-2 align:center
I'm already really happy
with it.


347
00:16:35.796 --> 00:16:37.030 line:-2 align:center
The inputs and outputs
of the method


348
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,599 line:-1
are really well defined,


349
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,636 line:0
and there's a helpful
code example here as well.


350
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:44,771 align:center
I think this is nearly
ready to go,


351
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,607 align:center
but we're still
missing something here.


352
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,610 align:center
If I'm just reading this
page of documentation,


353
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,512 line:0
I don't have a great
context of the other


354
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,014 line:0
relevant symbols I should
be considering here.


355
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,049 line:0
And as a maintainer
of SlothCreator,


356
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,784 line:0
I'd really like to call out
some other symbols


357
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,921 line:0
that my reader should consider
learning about next.


358
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:03,423 line:-1
Well, new to Xcode 13


359
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,593 line:0
is the ability to link to
symbols in your documentation.


360
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,929 line:0
This is a really great way
to connect


361
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,797 line:0
different parts
of your framework


362
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,101 line:0
and guide your reader to
relevant pieces of information.


363
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:17,938 align:center
You write these links via
a new double backtick syntax.


364
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:19,740 line:0
Let's look at an example.


365
00:17:21.508 --> 00:17:24.511 line:-2 align:center
Here's the method we
previously documented, sleep.


366
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:26,613 line:-2
But it doesn't exist
in a vacuum.


367
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,349 line:-2
There's actually another
property in the Sloth struct.


368
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,052 line:-1
There's a value representing


369
00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:33.787 line:-2 align:center
the current energy level
of the sloth,


370
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:35,322 line:-2
and I think
it's important here


371
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,990 line:-1
for my reader to understand


372
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,559 line:-2
that one
of the side effects


373
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,029 line:-2
of calling sleep is a change
to the sloth's energy level.


374
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:45,832 line:-2
So I'll add to my methods
Discussion section here


375
00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:48.268 line:-2 align:center
with a reference
to the energyLevel property.


376
00:17:49.703 --> 00:17:52.406 line:-2 align:center
Before Xcode 13,
the natural way to do this


377
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,641 line:-2
would be to just write
the property's name


378
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,445 line:-2
in a monospace code font by
surrounding it in backticks.


379
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:01,515 line:-2
But now I can transform
to double backtick syntax


380
00:18:01.582 --> 00:18:04.651 line:-1 align:center
and create a link.


381
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,287 line:-2
Now, linking to energyLevel
was pretty simple because


382
00:18:07.354 --> 00:18:10.524 line:-2 align:center
that property is a sibling
of the method I'm documenting,


383
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:13.360 line:-2 align:center
and just like when referencing
a local variable in Swift,


384
00:18:13.427 --> 00:18:16.663 line:-2 align:center
I don't need to further qualify
my link with the parent type.


385
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,633 line:-2
I can just write the name
of the property, energyLevel.


386
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:23,136 line:-2
But if I want to reference
a child of a different type,


387
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,772 line:-2
I need to be
a little more specific.


388
00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:30.410 line:-2 align:center
So here I write
Habitat/comfortLevel


389
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:33,780 line:-2
to link to a child
of the Habitat struct.


390
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,115 line:-1
Great.


391
00:18:35.182 --> 00:18:37.584 line:-2 align:center
Let's see how this works
in practice by adding some links


392
00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:40.220 line:-2 align:center
to the documentation
for the eat method.


393
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,489 line:-2
I'll begin here
by writing that


394
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,225 line:-2
"When they eat food,
a sloth's..."


395
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,227 line:-2
and now I'm going to
write a symbol link


396
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,296 line:-1
to the energyLevel property.


397
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,698 line:-1
So I'll type two backticks,


398
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:55,369 line:-2
and then I'll begin
writing energyLevel.


399
00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:57.037 line:-2 align:center
Xcode's code completion
will help me out


400
00:18:57.104 --> 00:18:59.306 line:-2 align:center
to make sure I'm
getting the correct link.


401
00:18:59.373 --> 00:19:01.475 line:-2 align:center
I'll go ahead and select
that item.


402
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,247 align:center
And so I'll say that
the energy level


403
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:10,484 line:0
"increases by the food's"--
and now I'm going to


404
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:12,686 line:0
reference a child
of the Food struct.


405
00:19:12,753 --> 00:19:16,356 line:0
I'll begin
with two backticks again.


406
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:20,727 align:center
And then I'll write Food,
a forward slash,


407
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,396 line:0
and then energy.


408
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,967 line:0
I've now created two
symbol links which I think


409
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:29,069 align:center
are going to really help
my reader understand


410
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:31,405 line:0
the context around
this method better.


411
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,608 line:0
And these links are even
accessible in Quick Help.


412
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,677 line:0
So I'll hold down the Option key


413
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,478 line:0
and click on
my method's declaration


414
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,215 line:0
to open the Quick Help popover.


415
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,050 align:center
Here's the Discussion
section we added


416
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:46,653 line:0
and, of course, in the
discussion, our two links.


417
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,289 line:0
And if I click on one,
I'm brought straight to


418
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,526 line:0
the referenced symbol's page
in the documentation window.


419
00:19:52.593 --> 00:19:55.295 line:-2 align:center
Now that I've written
a good documentation comment


420
00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.998 line:-2 align:center
for every public API
in SlothCreator,


421
00:19:58.065 --> 00:19:59.900 line:-2 align:center
I'm really excited to share
it with my colleagues


422
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,970 line:-2
and maybe even make it
available on the web.


423
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,473 line:0
I can do this via
the documentation archive


424
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,110 align:center
that Xcode outputs as part
of every documentation build.


425
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:13,780 align:center
Contained in the documentation
archive is a single-page web app


426
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:16,917 line:0
that you can use to share your
documentation on the web.


427
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:20,120 line:0
My colleague David will be going
in depth on just how to do that


428
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:24,224 line:0
in his “Host and automate
your DocC documentation” session.


429
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,193 line:0
I highly recommend
you check that one out.


430
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:30,864 line:-2
But Xcode also supports
exporting and importing


431
00:20:30.931 --> 00:20:34.568 line:-2 align:center
your documentation directly from
the documentation window.


432
00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:36.336 line:-1 align:center
Let's take a look at that now.


433
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,907 line:-2
I'll export SlothCreator
from the documentation window


434
00:20:39.973 --> 00:20:44.144 line:-2 align:center
by first moving my mouse over
to the window's Navigator.


435
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:47,181 line:-2
When I hover over
the SlothCreator framework item,


436
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,250 line:-2
a contextual menu icon
will appear.


437
00:20:50.317 --> 00:20:53.453 line:-2 align:center
I'll click on it, and now
I have the option to Export.


438
00:20:55.389 --> 00:20:57.424 line:-1 align:center
I'll just save it to my desktop.


439
00:20:57.491 --> 00:20:59.526 line:-1 align:center
Great.


440
00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:01.228 line:-2 align:center
Now I'm ready to send it
off to my colleagues,


441
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:03,530 line:-2
and if they just
double-click on the archive,


442
00:21:03.597 --> 00:21:06.099 line:-2 align:center
it will open in Xcode's
documentation window.


443
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,002 line:-2
But since I already know
about SlothCreator,


444
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:12,406 line:-2
I'd like to open up a different
documentation archive.


445
00:21:12.472 --> 00:21:14.208 line:-2 align:center
I've recently been discussing
with the team


446
00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:15.576 line:-1 align:center
that it would be great


447
00:21:15.642 --> 00:21:17.845 line:-2 align:center
to add a command line
interface to SlothCreator,


448
00:21:17.911 --> 00:21:20.714 line:-2 align:center
and one of my colleagues
mentioned that ArgumentParser


449
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:25,919 line:-2
They sent me the latest
documentation archive


450
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:28,956 line:-2
for ArgumentParser,
so let's open it up now.


451
00:21:29.022 --> 00:21:31.925 line:-2 align:center
I can just double-click
on the documentation archive


452
00:21:31.992 --> 00:21:37.297 line:-2 align:center
and, just like that,
get started learning right away.


453
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:40,868 line:0
Documentation is key
to developing a successful


454
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:43,237 align:center
and long-lasting framework.


455
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,305 line:0
We think that you'll find
writing documentation


456
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:48,675 align:center
directly in source is really
convenient and powerful.


457
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:52,079 line:0
And new in Xcode 13
with DocC integration,


458
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,815 line:0
all your hard work writing
great documentation


459
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:58,151 line:0
is going to pay off
in new and powerful ways.


460
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,989 align:center
We have several other
sessions at WWDC


461
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:05,659 line:0
that really help you take your
documentation to the next level.


462
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:08,529 align:center
“Elevate your DocC documentation
in Xcode”


463
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:10,664 align:center
picks up where
this session leaves off,


464
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:13,000 line:0
showing you how to better
organize your documentation


465
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:16,436 line:0
by adding
a documentation catalog.


466
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,972 line:0
“Host and automate
your DocC documentation,”


467
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,374 align:center
which I mentioned earlier,


468
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,843 align:center
explains how to integrate
documentation builds


469
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,479 line:0
into your existing continuous
integration setup


470
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:28,248 align:center
as well as how to host
your documentation online.


471
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:30,817 align:center
Finally, if you have


472
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:32,653 line:0
a more complicated
part of your framework


473
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,956 line:0
that could benefit from
step-by-step instruction,


474
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:37,391 line:0
I recommend you check out


475
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:40,194 line:0
“Build interactive tutorials
in DocC”


476
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,629 align:center
which will show
you how to do just that.


477
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:45,332 align:center
