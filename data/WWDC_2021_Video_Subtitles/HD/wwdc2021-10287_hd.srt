Irida Mance:
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


7
00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.448 line:-1 position:50%
I'm Irida, a scientist
on the Apple software team,


8
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:17,284 line:-1
and I will be joined by Sohum,
a Motion engineer.


9
00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.519 line:-1 position:50%
Today, we'll introduce
two brand-new features


10
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.122 line:-1 position:50%
that will enable you to better
understand walking endurance


11
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,090 line:-1
and quality.


12
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.925 line:-1 position:50%
Walking is a vital sign.


13
00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:27.327 line:-1 position:50%
The way an individual walks
is highly informative


14
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,529 line:-1
of their overall health
and well-being.


15
00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.099 line:-1 position:50%
It can be used to track
recovery from an injury,


16
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,502 line:-1
assess risk of falling,
monitor the aging process,


17
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,671 line:-1
and even predict mortality.


18
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:41.308 line:-1 position:50%
At WWDC2020, we introduced
a suite of mobility metrics


19
00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:43.744 line:-1 position:50%
that provide a powerful insight
into your walking patterns


20
00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:44.778 line:-1 position:50%
throughout the day.


21
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,947 position:50%
You can learn all about them
in last year's session,


22
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,649 position:50%
"Beyond counting steps".


23
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,384 position:50%
Today we're excited
to share an update


24
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,686 position:50%
to one of these metrics:


25
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:56,256 line:-1
the Six-Minute Walk metric,
available for Apple Watch.


26
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:59,092 line:-1
Through a new recalibration API,
the metric will enable you


27
00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.628 line:-1 position:50%
to better capture
acute changes in health.


28
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,798 line:-1
In addition, we're going to talk
about a brand-new metric:


29
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,235 line:-1
the Walking Steadiness feature,
available for iPhone.


30
00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.137 line:-1 position:50%
What do these two metrics
have in common?


31
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,105 line:-1
They're both great ways
to track important aspects


32
00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.074 line:-1 position:50%
of walking
and can provide continuous


33
00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.510 line:-1 position:50%
and objective measures
for monitoring improvements


34
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,545 line:-1
or catching early warning signs.


35
00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.347 line:-1 position:50%
But they capture
different things.


36
00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:22.950 line:-1 position:50%
The Six-Minute Walk metric
estimates how far you can walk


37
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.017 line:-1 position:50%
in six minutes


38
00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:27.187 line:-1 position:50%
and is a measure of your walking
capacity and endurance.


39
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,524 line:-1
Walking steadiness captures
the quality of your walking


40
00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.292 line:-1 position:50%
and is designed to make it
easy for you


41
00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.428 line:-1 position:50%
to assess an individual's
risk of falling


42
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,496 line:-1
based on their mobility.


43
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,299 line:-1
Whether you are tracking
these metrics week over week --


44
00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.702 line:-1 position:50%
to measure changes
in response to treatment --


45
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:42,669 line:-1
or year over year --


46
00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.738 line:-1 position:50%
to monitor natural
aging trends --


47
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,007 line:-1
both metrics can provide
a unique window


48
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.176 line:-1 position:50%
into an individual's health.


49
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,410 line:-1
We'll start by diving deeper


50
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,513 line:-1
into the Six-Minute Walk
distance metric.


51
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,582 line:-1
The in-clinic
Six-Minute Walk test


52
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,718 line:-1
is a staple for clinicians
in many fields


53
00:01:57.718 --> 00:02:00.988 line:-1 position:50%
to assess cardiovascular
and musculoskeletal health.


54
00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:02.956 line:-1 position:50%
The metric captures
walking endurance


55
00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.992 line:-1 position:50%
for low-capacity individuals.


56
00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:07.027 line:-1 position:50%
It can help identify
which individuals


57
00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:10.097 line:-1 position:50%
have a lower endurance relative
to others their age and height,


58
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:13,867 line:-1
which is often indicative
of poor health outcomes.


59
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,870 line:-1
This year,
using a new recalibration API,


60
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.106 line:-1 position:50%
the Six-Minute Walk metric
is also a great way


61
00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:20.941 line:-1 position:50%
to track changes
to walking capacity


62
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,777 line:-1
following an intervention --
such as a surgery --


63
00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:26.747 line:-1 position:50%
or an acute events,
like an injury.


64
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,081 line:-1
Let's run through a scenario


65
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,317 line:-1
where recalibrating
the Six-Minute Walk metric


66
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,918 line:-1
will be useful.


67
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,554 line:0
Imagine that we have
a patient, Jamie,


68
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,423 position:50%
who just had knee surgery.


69
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,959 position:50%
We know that Jamie could
barely walk after surgery,


70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,494 position:50%
but we only see a small dip


71
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,096 position:50%
in their Six-Minute Walk
estimate.


72
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,232 position:50%
Let's look into
what may be causing this.


73
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,301 position:50%
To build an accurate estimate
of an individual's capacity,


74
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,937 position:50%
the Six-Minute Walk distance
estimate looks at activity


75
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,408 position:50%
and motion data across
a historical measurement window.


76
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,409 position:50%
For example,


77
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,812 line:0
this is the measurement window
used for this estimate.


78
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,514 position:50%
To see how far back
an estimate looked,


79
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,482 position:50%
you can use a brand-new
metadata field,


80
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,617 line:0
which will tell you


81
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,286 position:50%
the beginning
of the data window used.


82
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,888 position:50%
We can see
that our example estimate


83
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:11,391 position:50%
used data from way
before the surgery.


84
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,860 line:0
What we can do now is
recalibrate our estimates


85
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,164 line:0
to use data only postsurgery.


86
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,398 position:50%
With this recalibration,


87
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,368 line:0
our estimates now capture
Jamie's true dip in mobility


88
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,904 position:50%
immediately following
the surgery, which allows


89
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,973 position:50%
for a way more accurate pre-
and postsurgery comparison.


90
00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.442 line:-1 position:50%
Now, Sohum can show us


91
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,078 line:-1
how to use these new features
in your app.


92
00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:32.279 line:-1 position:50%
Sohum Thakkar: Thank you, Irida!


93
00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.915 line:-1 position:50%
The recalibration API
lets you use your knowledge


94
00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:36.349 line:-1 position:50%
of Jamie's surgery date


95
00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.152 line:-1 position:50%
to improve their Six-Minute Walk
distance estimates.


96
00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:40.821 line:-1 position:50%
If know you want to recalibrate,


97
00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:43.857 line:-1 position:50%
you can use the brand-new
recalibrateEstimates method


98
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,659 line:-1
in HKHealthStore.


99
00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.795 line:-1 position:50%
This new method
has a few requirements.


100
00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.564 line:-1 position:50%
The first thing you need
is a SampleType


101
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,466 line:-1
that can be recalibrated.


102
00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:54.434 line:-1 position:50%
You can check
if a type can be recalibrated


103
00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:57.804 line:-1 position:50%
with the .allowsRecalibration
ForEstimates property.


104
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,306 line:-1
As of iOS 15,


105
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,308 line:-1
sixMinuteWalkType
is the only sampleType


106
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,043 line:-1
that can be recalibrated.


107
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,712 line:-1
The second thing you need
is a new entitlement.


108
00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:10.150 line:-1 position:50%
You can add this entitlement
to your Xcode project yourself.


109
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.352 line:-1 position:50%
And lastly, your app will need
authorization


110
00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:15.188 line:-1 position:50%
for both reading
and sharing the SampleType.


111
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,691 line:-1
To prompt the user to grant
your app authorization,


112
00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:18.758 line:-1 position:50%
simply create a set


113
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,128 line:-1
with just the Six-Minute Walk
distance type,


114
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,295 line:-1
and then pass it in


115
00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:25.132 line:-1 position:50%
to healthStore.
requestAuthorization.


116
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,100 line:-1
And with those requirements
out of the way,


117
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.035 line:-1 position:50%
let's recalibrate.


118
00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:32.105 line:-1 position:50%
Just use HKHealthStore's
recalibrateEstimates method


119
00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.908 line:-1 position:50%
and pass in the date of surgery.


120
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,043 position:50%
Since this affects
the patient's health data,


121
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,712 position:50%
a prompt will pop up on screen


122
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,748 line:0
asking them to allow
the recalibration.


123
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,816 line:-1
And that's it!


124
00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:44.151 line:-1 position:50%
For the next few estimates,


125
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,719 line:-1
you'll see
the recalibration date


126
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,287 line:-1
reflected in
the Measurement Start Date


127
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.555 line:-1 position:50%
in the Health App


128
00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:51.858 line:-1 position:50%
and in the EarliestDateUsed
ForEstimate metadata


129
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,361 line:-1
that will come
with every HealthKit sample.


130
00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:56.296 line:-1 position:50%
A few things to consider:


131
00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.865 line:-1 position:50%
First, this method
does not affect estimates


132
00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:02.135 line:-1 position:50%
that are already present
in HealthKit at the time of use,


133
00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.638 line:-1 position:50%
so it's important to recalibrate
as soon as possible


134
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,873 line:-1
after a surgery.


135
00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:08.875 line:-1 position:50%
Secondly, after recalibration,


136
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,443 line:-1
it could take up to 14 days


137
00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.312 line:-1 position:50%
to rebuild enough
activity history


138
00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.315 line:-1 position:50%
to make a confident estimate.


139
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,918 line:-1
And thirdly,
the effect is temporary.


140
00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:20.520 line:-1 position:50%
Once the recalibration date
is far enough in the past,


141
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.788 line:-1 position:50%
the estimates will once again


142
00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:26.092 line:-1 position:50%
start using their normal
measurement window.


143
00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.295 line:-1 position:50%
You might be tempted
to recalibrate every fall


144
00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:30.130 line:-1 position:50%
or every surgery
you learn about,


145
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,500 line:-1
but these often don't result
in reduced mobility or fitness.


146
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,534 line:-1
There's a trade-off.


147
00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:36.203 line:-1 position:50%
In general, a longer data window


148
00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:38.471 line:-1 position:50%
will result in more
accurate estimates


149
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,575 line:-1
but will be less responsive
to acute changes.


150
00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:42.809 line:-1 position:50%
In Jamie's case,


151
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,278 line:-1
we know their surgery will cause
a substantial change


152
00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:46.713 line:-1 position:50%
to their mobility and fitness,


153
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,349 line:-1
and we'd like to monitor
that change closely.


154
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.550 line:-1 position:50%
If they're not recovering well,


155
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,953 line:-1
we can reach out
and provide support.


156
00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:55.689 line:-1 position:50%
This new recalibration API
extends the capabilities


157
00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.824 line:-1 position:50%
of Apple's Six-Minute Walk
distance metric


158
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,560 line:-1
to a whole new use case
of tracking recovery


159
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,429 line:-1
from injury or surgery.


160
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,597 line:-1
We hope you'll find it useful


161
00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:05.565 line:-1 position:50%
in better monitoring
your patient's health


162
00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.467 line:-1 position:50%
and improving outcomes.


163
00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.302 line:-1 position:50%
Now I'd like to pass it off
to Irida


164
00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:12.272 line:-1 position:50%
to tell you about a brand-new
metric, Walking Steadiness,


165
00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:15.041 line:-1 position:50%
which measures a different
dimension of your walking.


166
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,243 line:-1
Irida: Thanks, Sohum.


167
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,178 line:-1
In addition to being able
to track how much


168
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,547 line:-1
or how far an individual
is able to walk,


169
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,451 line:-1
it's also important to monitor
the quality of that movement.


170
00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:27.721 line:-1 position:50%
With iOS 15, we've built upon
our foundational understanding


171
00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.757 line:-1 position:50%
of walking quality and extended
it through a new metric,


172
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,026 line:-1
the Apple
Walking Steadiness metric.


173
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,628 line:0
The metric is designed for you


174
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,197 position:50%
to better understand
your overall walking quality


175
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,865 position:50%
and can help assess
your risk of falling


176
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:43,436 position:50%
due to a mobility limitation
in the next 12 months.


177
00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:46.473 line:-1 position:50%
Your quality of walking
is impacted by many factors,


178
00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:48.441 line:-1 position:50%
including
your muscular strength,


179
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:50.810 line:-1 position:50%
your physical endurance,
your balance,


180
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.014 line:-1 position:50%
or external factors
like injuries or surgeries,


181
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,683 line:-1
all of which can alter
your risk of falling.


182
00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:59.819 line:-1 position:50%
The Apple Walking Steadiness
metric provides a unified way


183
00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.657 line:-1 position:50%
to track the mobility components
that contribute to fall risk.


184
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,526 line:-1
The feature consists
of three elements.


185
00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.194 line:-1 position:50%
First, we provide a score


186
00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.263 line:-1 position:50%
that can be used to continuously
monitor changes


187
00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.332 line:-1 position:50%
in walking steadiness
over time.


188
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,734 line:-1
A new score will be saved
to HealthKit weekly,


189
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:18,104 line:-1
and it will represent the user's
steadiness for that week.


190
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,074 line:-1
The score provides you
the greatest level of detail;


191
00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:23.943 line:-1 position:50%
the higher the score,
the better your walking quality,


192
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,012 line:-1
and the lower
your predicted risk of falling


193
00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:28.948 line:-1 position:50%
because of a mobility
limitation.


194
00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:29.949 line:-1 position:50%
Second,


195
00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:33.186 line:-1 position:50%
to give a better idea of what
the steadiness scores mean,


196
00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:36.022 line:-1 position:50%
we've categorized them
into three classifications:


197
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,825 line:-1
OK, Low, and Very Low.


198
00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:41.094 line:-1 position:50%
These classifications
provide you a simpler way


199
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:45,498 line:-1
of identifying who is
at the highest risk of falling.


200
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,599 line:0
Lastly,


201
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,569 position:50%
after individuals onboard onto
the Walking Steadiness feature


202
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,637 line:0
in the Health app,


203
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,672 line:0
we have enabled
a notification.


204
00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:54.607 line:-1 position:50%
The notification
will alert individuals


205
00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:56.576 line:-1 position:50%
whenever their steadiness
has dropped


206
00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:59.079 line:-1 position:50%
to the Low or Very Low category,


207
00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:03.083 line:-1 position:50%
or if they've remained at those
categories for several months.


208
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,518 line:-1
Now you may be wondering,
What does steadiness look like


209
00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:08.421 line:-1 position:50%
for typical healthy individuals
throughout their life?


210
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.190 line:-1 position:50%
Let's see what
the Walking Steadiness metric


211
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,459 line:-1
could look like for two folks.


212
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,760 position:50%
For this individual,


213
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,863 position:50%
their walking quality
decreases as they age.


214
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,198 position:50%
This is fairly typical.


215
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,133 position:50%
We've all seen
that our elderly relatives


216
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,435 line:0
may not walk as well as us.


217
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,504 line:0
But we also know
there are behavioral factors


218
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,406 line:0
that contribute to steadiness.


219
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,607 line:0
For example,


220
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,910 position:50%
an individual that is able to
maintain a high level of fitness


221
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,380 position:50%
is likely to preserve
a higher quality of walking


222
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,814 position:50%
as they age.


223
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,883 line:0
But we also know
that age or better fitness


224
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,253 line:0
are not the only factors
that impact walking steadiness.


225
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,489 line:0
Acute events
like an ankle injury


226
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,657 position:50%
can drastically change
walking quality


227
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,626 position:50%
and lead to
heightened fall risk.


228
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,429 line:0
So anyone can bounce
between steadiness categories


229
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,698 position:50%
throughout their life.


230
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,732 line:0
And as I mentioned,


231
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,268 position:50%
the steadiness classification
helps you understand


232
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,404 position:50%
the significance
of these changes.


233
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,671 position:50%
Let's dive a little deeper


234
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,241 line:0
into what individuals
with these classification levels


235
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,510 line:0
may look like.


236
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,514 line:0
An OK classification will be
your healthy, confident walker.


237
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,516 line:0
They generally will not have
any difficulty


238
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,651 position:50%
going about their day
and doing many of the tasks


239
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,187 line:0
that challenge their strength
and coordination.


240
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,489 position:50%
Their scores will be high,
and their risk of falling


241
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:20,460 position:50%
due to a mobility-related
health issue is low.


242
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,995 position:50%
A low-classification individual


243
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,397 position:50%
will have more
compromised mobility.


244
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,999 position:50%
They may be generally OK;


245
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,168 position:50%
but in more
challenging situations --


246
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,569 line:0
say a difficult hike --


247
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,171 line:0
they may need
to take more precautions


248
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,806 line:0
to prevent from falling.


249
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,274 position:50%
They might not have fallen yet,


250
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,910 line:0
but this early awareness
will be useful.


251
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,911 position:50%
Lastly,


252
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,913 position:50%
a Very Low classification
is indicative


253
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,116 line:0
of someone that has noticeably
compromised steadiness.


254
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,317 position:50%
Based on their mobility,


255
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,120 line:0
this individual would be
at high risk of falling.


256
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,988 position:50%
Again, they might not
have fallen yet,


257
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,124 position:50%
but their mobility
is compromised,


258
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,992 position:50%
and they should take
the necessary measures


259
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:56,196 position:50%
to avoid situations where
falls are more likely to happen


260
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:59,199 position:50%
or, if possible, to improve
their strength and balance


261
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,600 position:50%
through exercise.


262
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.701 line:-1 position:50%
All right.


263
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,837 line:-1
That's what this metric
is capable of.


264
00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:04.838 line:-1 position:50%
Now you might ask,


265
00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:07.807 line:-1 position:50%
What is required to get a
Walking Steadiness estimate?


266
00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.642 line:-1 position:50%
Actually, not much.


267
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,845 line:-1
the metric is optimized
to measure steadiness


268
00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:13.847 line:-1 position:50%
while individuals
are carrying their iPhone


269
00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:15.748 line:-1 position:50%
in some of the most
common locations,


270
00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:20.119 line:-1 position:50%
for example, a pant pocket,
a jacket pocket,


271
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,921 line:-1
even a purse held closely;


272
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,424 line:-1
all will work as long as
the device is held tightly


273
00:10:24.424 --> 00:10:26.392 line:-1 position:50%
to the center of your body.


274
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,127 line:-1
Now back to Sohum
to walk us through


275
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,996 line:-1
how to leverage
the Walking Steadiness metric


276
00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:31.331 line:-1 position:50%
in your apps.


277
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,365 line:-1
Thanks, Irida


278
00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:34.501 line:-1 position:50%
for that introduction
to Walking Steadiness.


279
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:36.069 line:-1 position:50%
Let's put it to use.


280
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:39.172 line:-1 position:50%
Imagine you're building an app
for a physical therapy clinic.


281
00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:41.274 line:-1 position:50%
One of the toughest challenges
in physical therapy


282
00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:44.143 line:-1 position:50%
and rehabilitation
is tracking progress.


283
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,812 line:-1
And now that most visits
are virtual,


284
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,614 line:-1
and telehealth
is gaining popularity,


285
00:10:47.614 --> 00:10:49.282 line:-1 position:50%
it can be even tougher.


286
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,051 line:-1
Let's say your app's purpose
is to keep patients up to date


287
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,821 line:-1
and identify those
at higher risk of falling


288
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,490 line:-1
and those who are declining
in steadiness.


289
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,759 line:-1
That's an incredibly difficult
thing to measure,


290
00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.861 line:-1 position:50%
but Walking Steadiness can help.


291
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:02.896 line:-1 position:50%
As Irida mentioned,


292
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,064 line:-1
Walking Steadiness
has three elements:


293
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,835 line:-1
the score, the classification,
and the notification.


294
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,538 line:-1
We'll see how each can be
integrated into your app


295
00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:14.240 line:-1 position:50%
for physical therapy patients...


296
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,175 line:-1
starting with the score.


297
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,510 line:-1
Let's say you want
to display


298
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,380 line:-1
a patient's
most recent steadiness score.


299
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,115 line:-1
Let's see how to do that.


300
00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:24.417 line:-1 position:50%
The score is
a HealthKit quantityType


301
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,186 line:-1
with the name
appleWalkingSteadiness.


302
00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:30.657 line:-1 position:50%
Since it's an Apple-defined
metric, it's read-only.


303
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,692 line:-1
Its unit in HealthKit
is percent,


304
00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.094 line:-1 position:50%
and it ranges
from zero to one.


305
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,229 line:-1
And it's written weekly,


306
00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:37.797 line:-1 position:50%
although estimates
may be delayed


307
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:41,301 line:-1
if there isn't enough data
to compute an estimate.


308
00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:44.270 line:-1 position:50%
To kick us off,
let's grab an authorization.


309
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.473 line:-1 position:50%
We'll construct a set with
the appleWalkingSteadiness type.


310
00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:50.910 line:-1 position:50%
Then, we'll call
requestAuthorization.


311
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.079 line:-1 position:50%
To get the most recent
steadiness score,


312
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,416 line:-1
we'll construct a SampleQuery
with a limit of one,


313
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,418 line:-1
sorted by end date.


314
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,086 line:-1
If there is a returned sample,


315
00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:03.189 line:-1 position:50%
we'll grab the value
with percent units


316
00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:06.059 line:-1 position:50%
and update our status
in the app.


317
00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:08.061 line:-1 position:50%
This is what it'll look like.


318
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,929 line:-1
The score is great
for tracking trends,


319
00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:13.132 line:-1 position:50%
but is sometimes kind of hard
to interpret on its own.


320
00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.867 line:-1 position:50%
What does 45 mean?


321
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,170 line:-1
The classification might be
the more appropriate level


322
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.272 line:-1 position:50%
of granularity for most people.


323
00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:21.307 line:-1 position:50%
Let's use it to add context.


324
00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:22.976 line:-1 position:50%
The classification
comes in the form


325
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,044 line:-1
of a brand-new HealthKit enum:


326
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,648 line:-1
HKAppleWalkingSteadiness
Classification.


327
00:12:28.648 --> 00:12:32.752 line:-1 position:50%
The enum can take the
values .ok, .low, and .veryLow.


328
00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:36.055 line:-1 position:50%
Starting from our previous code
to grab the most recent score,


329
00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:37.457 line:-1 position:50%
it only takes a single line


330
00:12:37.457 --> 00:12:40.360 line:-1 position:50%
to convert a score
to a classification.


331
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,563 position:50%
The classification enum
has a convenience constructor


332
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,733 position:50%
that will translate a score to
the appropriate classification.


333
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,267 position:50%
And we'll display
the classification


334
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,169 line:0
along with the score.


335
00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:52.405 line:-1 position:50%
There!
That's far more interpretable.


336
00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:55.375 line:-1 position:50%
Now we can tell this individual
is in the Low classification


337
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,011 line:-1
and may be
at increased risk of falling.


338
00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.580 line:-1 position:50%
OK, so now let's tackle
the patient-monitoring portion


339
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,748 line:-1
of this app.


340
00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:03.016 line:-1 position:50%
We'd like to be able to identify


341
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,486 line:-1
and reach out to patients
who are at high risk of falling.


342
00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:09.355 line:-1 position:50%
The Walking Steadiness
notification is great for this.


343
00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:11.057 line:-1 position:50%
You can register to be notified


344
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,826 line:-1
when a patient receives
a steadiness notification


345
00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:15.862 line:-1 position:50%
and reach out to them
for a check-in.


346
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,563 line:-1
The notification arrives
in HealthKit


347
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,832 line:-1
as a CategoryType sample,
and it's called


348
00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:23.102 line:-1 position:50%
"appleWalkingSteadinessEvent"
in HealthKit.


349
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,004 line:-1
It's also a read-only type.


350
00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:28.341 line:-1 position:50%
There are four types
of steadinessEvents.


351
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,444 line:-1
.initialLow and .initialVeryLow
are triggered about a month


352
00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:32.979 line:-1 position:50%
after the individual drops


353
00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:36.649 line:-1 position:50%
into the Low
or Very Low classifications.


354
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,451 line:-1
After this initial notification,


355
00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:41.320 line:-1 position:50%
.repeatLow
or .repeatVeryLow events


356
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.624 line:-1 position:50%
will remind the individual
about once every three months


357
00:13:44.624 --> 00:13:47.260 line:-1 position:50%
if they stay
at the same classification.


358
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,529 line:-1
You can read more
about the notification types


359
00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:50.997 line:-1 position:50%
in the developer documentation


360
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,233 line:-1
in the links associated
with this session.


361
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,468 line:-1
To read the notifications,


362
00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:57.670 line:-1 position:50%
we'll need
another authorization.


363
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,138 line:-1
This time, we'll construct a set


364
00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:02.275 line:-1 position:50%
with only the type
appleWalkingSteadinessEvent


365
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,445 line:-1
and pass it in to the
requestAuthorization method.


366
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,346 line:-1
Let's watch for notifications.


367
00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:09.882 line:-1 position:50%
Here we're creating
an HKObserverQuery


368
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,719 line:-1
that will execute a handler
every time a steadiness event


369
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,287 line:-1
is saved to HealthKit,


370
00:14:14.287 --> 00:14:17.090 line:-1 position:50%
meaning the user
got a notification.


371
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,493 position:50%
In this handler, we'll prompt
the user for a checkup.


372
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:23,229 line:0
We'll also allow HealthKit
to deliver the event to us


373
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,631 line:0
in the background
to ensure we can respond


374
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,201 position:50%
to the notification
within a day.


375
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,769 line:0
When we execute the query,


376
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,005 position:50%
our app will begin listening
for notifications.


377
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,241 line:0
And every time the user
receives a notification,


378
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,542 position:50%
we could trigger a prompt


379
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,945 position:50%
to schedule a virtual checkup
with the clinic.


380
00:14:38.945 --> 00:14:42.415 line:-1 position:50%
Great! Now you can reach out to
patients at increased fall risk.


381
00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:43.583 line:-1 position:50%
But there are other users


382
00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:46.185 line:-1 position:50%
a physical therapy clinic
might be interested in.


383
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,821 line:-1
Here's an example of a patient
who showed great progress


384
00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:51.758 line:-1 position:50%
at first but is now declining
in steadiness.


385
00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:52.959 line:-1 position:50%
They wouldn't have received


386
00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:54.627 line:-1 position:50%
a Walking Steadiness
notification


387
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,631 line:-1
because they aren't yet at a
higher-fall-risk classification.


388
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,032 line:-1
But a physical therapy clinic


389
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,934 line:-1
might be concerned
about trends like this.


390
00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:03.970 line:-1 position:50%
Are the exercises appropriate?


391
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.371 line:-1 position:50%
Are they causing damage?


392
00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:07.473 line:-1 position:50%
Is the patient
just not keeping up?


393
00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:09.041 line:-1 position:50%
We'd like to schedule
a follow-up,


394
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,445 line:-1
so let's design
our own notification criteria.


395
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,681 line:-1
Here are the patient's
steadiness scores over time.


396
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:18.584 line:-1 position:50%
The plan is to query six weeks
of steadiness scores


397
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,053 line:-1
and calculate
the best-fit slope.


398
00:15:21.053 --> 00:15:22.855 line:-1 position:50%
We'll do this every week,


399
00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:25.625 line:-1 position:50%
and if a patient's steadiness
is declining more than, say,


400
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,760 line:-1
five points per week on average,


401
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.531 line:-1 position:50%
we should try
to schedule a check-in.


402
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,767 line:-1
Let's create a predicate
to query in the past six weeks


403
00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.836 line:-1 position:50%
and execute an HKSampleQuery


404
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:40,606 line:-1
for the appleWalkingSteadiness
QuantityType.


405
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,440 line:-1
In the callback,


406
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,811 line:-1
we'll pass the results off
to a detectTrends function.


407
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:48.014 line:-1 position:50%
Now, all we need to do
is calculate the best-fit slope,


408
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,483 line:-1
using a custom function
we have defined,


409
00:15:50.483 --> 00:15:52.251 line:-1 position:50%
and check if it's less than -5,


410
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:53.953 line:-1 position:50%
meaning steadiness is declining


411
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,955 line:-1
at a rate of over five points
per week.


412
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:58.491 line:-1 position:50%
And if it is, we can prompt
the user for a checkup,


413
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,060 line:-1
just like before.


414
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,863 position:50%
So now when we detect
their steadiness is declining,


415
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,265 position:50%
they will receive a prompt!


416
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,934 line:-1
So that's how to use
all three elements


417
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,035 line:-1
of Walking Steadiness


418
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,271 line:-1
and how to design your own
simple notification criteria.


419
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,339 line:-1
It's never been so easy


420
00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:16.209 line:-1 position:50%
to perform passive
mobility monitoring.


421
00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:18.110 line:-1 position:50%
But let's not get
ahead of ourselves.


422
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.345 line:-1 position:50%
All of this is dependent


423
00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:21.914 line:-1 position:50%
on the patient getting
Walking Steadiness scores.


424
00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:23.382 line:-1 position:50%
Here are four best practices


425
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,385 line:-1
to make sure they don't miss
a single sample.


426
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,654 line:-1
First off, users will only
get steadiness


427
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.090 line:-1 position:50%
if they have their height
set in the Health app.


428
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,392 line:-1
Weight and age are
highly recommended.


429
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,028 line:-1
So first things first,
let's prompt them for those.


430
00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:38.664 line:-1 position:50%
We recommend writing
updated samples directly,


431
00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:41.868 line:-1 position:50%
via the HealthKit API.


432
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,237 line:0
Secondly, we recommend
prompting the user


433
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:47,340 line:0
to turn on Apple's Walking
Steadiness notifications.


434
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,610 position:50%
They can do this from the
Health app in the Mobility room.


435
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.378 line:-1 position:50%
Third, as Irida mentioned,


436
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,013 line:-1
for the vast majority
of patients,


437
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,381 line:-1
keeping their phone
in their pocket


438
00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.316 line:-1 position:50%
while they go about
their everyday activities


439
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,552 line:-1
is enough
to get steadiness scores.


440
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,687 line:-1
Let's just encourage them
to take their phone with them


441
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,322 line:-1
while they're walking around.


442
00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:05.024 line:-1 position:50%
To check if they're meeting
the walking criteria,


443
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,292 line:-1
we can check
if they're receiving


444
00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:08.694 line:-1 position:50%
walking speed estimates
in HealthKit.


445
00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:10.930 line:-1 position:50%
Two weeks with consistent
Walking Speed samples


446
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,100 line:-1
is a good indicator they're
carrying their device enough.


447
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,401 line:-1
As a reminder,


448
00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:17.970 line:-1 position:50%
walking speed requires
an iPhone 8 or above,


449
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,805 line:-1
and is measured
when the phone is held tightly


450
00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:23.476 line:-1 position:50%
to the center of the body
while walking over flat ground.


451
00:17:23.476 --> 00:17:25.144 line:-1 position:50%
A quick glance
in the Health app,


452
00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:26.579 line:-1 position:50%
or a quick HealthKit query,


453
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,180 line:-1
can tell us if we need
to prompt them


454
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.649 line:-1 position:50%
to walk with their phone more.


455
00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:30.783 line:-1 position:50%
So there you have it!


456
00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:32.218 line:-1 position:50%
You have all the tools
you need


457
00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.320 line:-1 position:50%
to build the next-generation
physical therapy app


458
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.455 line:-1 position:50%
that can keep track of
your patient's walking quality


459
00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:39.759 line:-1 position:50%
without any dedicated
equipment or assessments.


460
00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:42.962 line:-1 position:50%
Now, over to Irida to talk about
the many other amazing ways


461
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:46,599 line:-1
you can use Walking Steadiness
for health monitoring.


462
00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:47.833 line:-1 position:50%
Irida: Thanks, Sohum.


463
00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:49.435 line:-1 position:50%
We just saw how
Walking Steadiness


464
00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:51.370 line:-1 position:50%
can make a huge difference
to virtual care


465
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.573 line:-1 position:50%
for physical therapy,
and it can do so much more.


466
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,242 line:-1
Consider using
Walking Steadiness


467
00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:58.210 line:-1 position:50%
if you want to build an app
that helps families


468
00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.379 line:-1 position:50%
check up on
an aging grandparent,


469
00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:03.282 line:-1 position:50%
or perhaps you can help patients
with neurological diseases


470
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,686 line:-1
like multiple sclerosis
monitor disease progression.


471
00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:08.487 line:-1 position:50%
You could even use it
to recommend workouts

and hikes that are more tailored
to an individual's fall risk.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.460 line:-1 position:50%
Walking Steadiness
and the new capabilities


474
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,363 line:-1
for Six-Minute Walk built
on top of a rich ecosystem


475
00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:20.433 line:-1 position:50%
for using motion sensing
to monitor heath.


476
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,568 line:-1
Given the strong ties
between mobility,


477
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,638 line:-1
cardiovascular
and respiratory functioning,


478
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,139 line:-1
we encourage you to explore


479
00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:29.575 line:-1 position:50%
how metrics related
to cardiovascular health


480
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,576 line:-1
on the Apple Watch --


481
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,511 line:0
and mobility for the iPhone --


482
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,282 position:50%
can be used for rehabilitation
or prehabilitation applications,


483
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,952 line:0
to best prepare patients
for successful surgery.


484
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,921 line:0
Or consider
how Walking Steadiness,


485
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,957 line:0
the mobility metrics,
and our Movement Disorder API


486
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,660 line:0
can be combined to monitor
the complicated motor symptoms


487
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,729 line:0
of Parkinson's Disease.


488
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,364 line:0
The combination of these metrics


489
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,567 position:50%
can unlock a truly powerful
experience for your apps.


490
00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:57.036 line:-1 position:50%
To wrap up, we want to provide
some best practices


491
00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:58.637 line:-1 position:50%
when collecting this data.


492
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,572 line:-1
First,


493
00:18:59.572 --> 00:19:02.375 line:-1 position:50%
though walking is something we
don't often think a lot about,


494
00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:05.611 line:-1 position:50%
as we've just seen, it carries
a powerful health signal.


495
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:07.313 line:-1 position:50%
As with any health information,


496
00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.615 line:-1 position:50%
make sure that your data
collection has strong privacy


497
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,517 line:-1
and security safeguards.


498
00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.519 line:-1 position:50%
Any data you take
outside of HealthKit


499
00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:18.124 line:-1 position:50%
should at the very least
be key-coded and encrypted.


500
00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:19.658 line:-1 position:50%
Next, you should be transparent


501
00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:22.561 line:-1 position:50%
about the information
you are collecting and why.


502
00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:25.164 line:-1 position:50%
Anytime you request to read
a certain HealthKit type,


503
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.533 line:-1 position:50%
we'll prompt the user
to approve its use.


504
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,636 line:-1
But beyond this basic measure,
it's our joint responsibility


505
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,772 line:-1
to collect only
the most meaningful data


506
00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:36.075 line:-1 position:50%
and to be transparent
on how that data will be used.


507
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,811 line:-1
For example,
for Six-Minute Walk estimates,


508
00:19:38.811 --> 00:19:42.281 line:-1 position:50%
our users should understand when
the recalibration is appropriate


509
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,417 line:-1
and how it helps their care.


510
00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:46.118 line:-1 position:50%
For the Walking Steadiness metric,


511
00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:47.853 line:-1 position:50%
the requirements
to get an estimate


512
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,955 line:-1
should be clearly communicated.


513
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,390 line:-1
Working with domain experts,


514
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.592 line:-1 position:50%
like physicians
or physical therapists,


515
00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:55.628 line:-1 position:50%
will ensure that you collect
the most meaningful data


516
00:19:55.628 --> 00:19:57.329 line:-1 position:50%
from these metrics.


517
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,733 line:-1
Lastly, your customer should
have control of their data.


518
00:20:00.733 --> 00:20:03.602 line:-1 position:50%
In HealthKit, an individual
can tap Show All Data


519
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,639 line:-1
and delete any and all samples
collected from them.


520
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,741 line:-1
If you take data
outside of HealthKit,


521
00:20:08.741 --> 00:20:11.744 line:-1 position:50%
your customer should have
an easy way to view and delete,


522
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,379 line:-1
turn off data collection,


523
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,414 line:-1
or have other means
to exercise control


524
00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:17.616 line:-1 position:50%
over what is collected
from them.


525
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,552 line:-1
Whether you are using
Walking Steadiness


526
00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.620 line:-1 position:50%
to measure quality of movement,


527
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,657 line:-1
the Six-Minute Walk metric
to assess recovery from injury,


528
00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:26.358 line:-1 position:50%
or any other health metric,


529
00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:29.161 line:-1 position:50%
following these guidelines will
protect our customers' data


530
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,263 line:-1
and promote user trust.


531
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,365 line:-1
A commitment to these principles
is essential


532
00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:36.535 line:-1 position:50%
when handling any health data.


533
00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.571 line:-1 position:50%
OK, that's a wrap for us.


534
00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:39.972 line:-1 position:50%
We want to thank you
for watching


535
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,441 line:-1
and being part of WWDC21.


536
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,510 line:-1
We cannot wait to see
what you build next.
