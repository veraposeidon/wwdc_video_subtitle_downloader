[Jiabao] Hello! I'm Jiabao Li,


4
00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:14.114 line:-2 align:center
a designer
on the Prototyping team.


5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,682 line:-2
I'll be joined later
by my colleague,


6
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,217 line:-1
MylÃ¨ne Dreyer.


7
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.219 line:-1 align:center
We are so excited to talk about


8
00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.555 line:-1 align:center
how to design user interfaces


9
00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:24.057 line:-1 align:center
that are discoverable.


10
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.793 line:-1 align:center
Your app has amazing features,


11
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:29,363 line:-2
but people might not know the
features exist


12
00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.665 line:-1 align:center
if they are not self-evident.


13
00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.400 line:-2 align:center
So, today,
we are going to talk about


14
00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:37.471 line:-2 align:center
how people learn about
what your app can do.


15
00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.174 line:-2 align:center
If your interface
is discoverable,


16
00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:43.310 line:-2 align:center
it means that people should
be able to look at a screen


17
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,345 line:-1
and, before they touch anything,


18
00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.149 line:-1 align:center
know what they can do, and how.


19
00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:50.517 line:-1 align:center
Let's use an example


20
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,252 line:-1
to explore different ways


21
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,721 line:-2
to make your app
more discoverable.


22
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,089 line:-1
For several years now,


23
00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:58.425 line:-2 align:center
our team has worked
on a boutique app


24
00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.761 line:-1 align:center
for finding the best toast.


25
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:04,998 line:-2
This year, our app
is expanding into making toast.


26
00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.568 line:-1 align:center
Introducing Toasty!


27
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:11,738 line:-2
The premier
smart toast recipe generator.


28
00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:15.409 line:-2 align:center
You can choose recipes from
curated selections of toast.


29
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,178 line:-2
You can see fancy toast
your friends made.


30
00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:21.481 line:-2 align:center
You can even generate a recipe
by taking a picture of toast


31
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,417 line:-1
that's right in front of you.


32
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,820 line:-2
How will people learn
about all the features?


33
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,523 line:-2
Hmm, let's line them up
one by one


34
00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:31.358 line:-1 align:center
in our onboarding tutorial.


35
00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.428 line:-2 align:center
Let's tell people
how to browse toast,


36
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,697 line:-2
and about generating recipes
from a picture.


37
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.965 line:-1 align:center
Oh, but also


38
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:41,969 line:-2
all the instructions about
how to take a picture in Toasty,


39
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:46.240 line:-2 align:center
specifically to make
for the best results.


40
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,041 line:-1
OK, except,


41
00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:49.343 line:-1 align:center
let me be honest.


42
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,513 line:-2
I always skip through
these onboarding screens.


43
00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:53.680 line:-1 align:center
I don't even read them,


44
00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:54.982 line:-1 align:center
so why would people


45
00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:57.484 line:-2 align:center
want to read onboarding screens
I made?


46
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,820 line:-1
When I open up this Toasty app,


47
00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:02.256 line:-2 align:center
these screens are
just another thing between me


48
00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.725 line:-1 align:center
and fancy delicious toast.


49
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,594 line:-2
Even if people had the patience
to read each screen,


50
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,497 line:-2
why would they remember
everything later?


51
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:13.934 line:-2 align:center
You need an interface
that stands on its own,


52
00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.303 line:-1 align:center
without heavy-handed tutorials,


53
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,273 line:-1
because learning by doing


54
00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:21.975 line:-1 align:center
is a lot more fun and effective


55
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.245 line:-2 align:center
than reading
a list of instructions.


56
00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.447 line:-1 align:center
So, here are five fundamentals


57
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:30.317 line:-2 align:center
to make your app
more discoverable.


58
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.419 line:-1 align:center
First, rank your features


59
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:36,523 line:-2
so you can make
the most important ones visible.


60
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:41,295 line:-2
Second, use words and symbols
people are familiar with


61
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,797 line:-1
to provide visual cues.


62
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.568 line:-2 align:center
Third, use gestures
for fluid navigation,


63
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,070 line:-1
but hint at gestures.


64
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:54,675 line:-2
Fourth, group content
to fit people's behavior.


65
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,711 line:-2
And fifth,
convey a sense of control


66
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,547 line:-1
over personalized content.


67
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:02.783 line:-1 align:center
These concepts may seem basic.


68
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,117 line:-1
In a way, they are.


69
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.853 line:-1 align:center
They are so fundamental,


70
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,155 line:-1
we take them for granted.


71
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.157 line:-1 align:center
But there are nuances here


72
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.125 line:-1 align:center
that might not be obvious


73
00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.094 line:-1 align:center
and are worth unpacking


74
00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.763 line:-2 align:center
because your app
doesn't get a second chance


75
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,966 line:-1
at a first impression.


76
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:23,136 line:-2
So, first,
prioritize important features.


77
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.539 line:-2 align:center
Not all pixels
are created equal.


78
00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:29.209 line:-2 align:center
Which is great because
neither are all of our features.


79
00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:31.712 line:-1 align:center
The essential parts of your app


80
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,948 line:-2
should be immediately visible
to people.


81
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,885 line:-2
It's okay for the non-essential
parts


82
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,654 line:-2
to require some
navigation to reach.


83
00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:42.990 line:-1 align:center
When we were designing Toasty,


84
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:43,924 line:-1
we wrote down a list


85
00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.727 line:-2 align:center
of all the important features
of our app.


86
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.629 line:-1 align:center
These are a lot of features,


87
00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:50.063 line:-1 align:center
and there's no way


88
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:53,200 line:-2
they're all going to fit
into one screen.


89
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,469 line:-1
We really need to prioritize


90
00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:57.771 line:-1 align:center
which features are important


91
00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:02.042 line:-2 align:center
so that we're not trying to cram
all of them onto one screen.


92
00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.844 line:-2 align:center
So, we ordered
a list of features


93
00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:05.812 line:-1 align:center
by their level of importance.


94
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,249 line:-2
Browsing toast recipes
and viewing my recipes


95
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,919 line:-2
are very important for people to
see.


96
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:15,122 line:-2
"Settings" and "About Us" are
less critical,


97
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,090 line:-1
especially the "About Us" page.


98
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,759 line:-1
A person using your app


99
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,495 line:-2
might want to know
the developer of the app


100
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,464 line:-2
to report a problem
or make a suggestion,


101
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:27,134 line:-2
but it's not
one of the top three things


102
00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:28.402 line:-1 align:center
they'll want to do.


103
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,937 line:-1
When designing your app,


104
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,472 line:-2
try to understand
what is important


105
00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:34.775 line:-1 align:center
from your user's perspective.


106
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:35,709 line:-1
Great!


107
00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:38.145 line:-2 align:center
So, we have our ten
main features,


108
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:41,615 line:-2
and we know people
love clean interfaces.


109
00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:42.683 line:-1 align:center
So, we'll just throw


110
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,619 line:-2
all the non-essential features
into a menu.


111
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,821 line:-1
Clean and easy, right?


112
00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.590 line:-2 align:center
You may have seen
this icon before.


113
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.892 line:-1 align:center
It's called a hamburger menu.


114
00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:55.262 line:-2 align:center
When we tested our interface
in the hands of people


115
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,997 line:-1
and found out that,


116
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,066 line:-2
when the hamburger menu
is closed,


117
00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.935 line:-1 align:center
people don't know what's inside.


118
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,071 line:-2
The three lines
don't convey anything


119
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,306 line:-1
about the features inside.


120
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.675 line:-2 align:center
So, instead,
we decided to go with


121
00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:11.144 line:-1 align:center
a tab bar navigation system,


122
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,981 line:-2
which appears
at the bottom of an app


123
00:05:14.014 --> 00:05:18.352 line:-2 align:center
and lets people quickly switch
between different sections.


124
00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:21.488 line:-2 align:center
It's better because
you can immediately see


125
00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:23.423 line:-2 align:center
the most important
features of the app.


126
00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:27.995 line:-1 align:center
The most minimal user interfaces


127
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,697 line:-1
might not be usable or simple


128
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:34.434 line:-2 align:center
because people
won't know what to do.


129
00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:36.103 line:-1 align:center
Because when we hide things


130
00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:38.038 line:-1 align:center
to make the app look minimal,


131
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:42,543 line:-2
we increase the risk
that people won't find features.


132
00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:45.913 line:-2 align:center
They might even forget that
your favorite feature exists.


133
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,382 line:-1
On the other extreme,


134
00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:51.485 line:-2 align:center
what if all the features
are equally important,


135
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,154 line:-2
and I have to cram them all
into one space


136
00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:56.590 line:-1 align:center
with six tab buttons?


137
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:00,861 line:-2
But too many tabs reduces
the tappable area of each tab


138
00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:04.731 line:-2 align:center
and increases the complexity
of your app,


139
00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:05.966 line:-1 align:center
which can make it harder


140
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,936 line:-2
for people
to locate information.


141
00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.437 line:-1 align:center
Look, I understand that


142
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,206 line:-2
you have been in
these situations.


143
00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:13.207 line:-1 align:center
Some people think


144
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,542 line:-2
everything is important
to show first,


145
00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:17.211 line:-2 align:center
and some people want to hide
everything


146
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,745 line:-1
for a cleaner look.


147
00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.148 line:-1 align:center
It's hard to serve both of them,


148
00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:23.617 line:-2 align:center
and you have to make hard
decisions


149
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.953 line:-1 align:center
in terms of what to prioritize.


150
00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:27.654 line:-1 align:center
It's a balancing act.


151
00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:30.490 line:-2 align:center
What are the reasons
features might be worth


152
00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:33.360 line:-2 align:center
showing front and center
in your app?


153
00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.296 line:-2 align:center
The features
are the main points of the app,


154
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.033 line:-2 align:center
or people
use the features frequently.


155
00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:42.302 line:-1 align:center
The main unique points of Toasty


156
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,104 line:-1
is browse toast recipes,


157
00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.339 line:-1 align:center
view my recipe,


158
00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:48.275 line:-2 align:center
and take a picture
to generate a recipe.


159
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,944 line:-2
And people browse through
pieces of toast


160
00:06:50.978 --> 00:06:54.715 line:-2 align:center
and collect a set of recipes
most frequently.


161
00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:57.284 line:-2 align:center
We divided these features
into two screens.


162
00:06:57.317 --> 00:07:01.121 line:-2 align:center
We named the screens "For You"
and "Recipes."


163
00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:03.690 line:-2 align:center
We placed these screens
in the most visible


164
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:07,127 line:-2
and reachable place,
the tab bar.


165
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.762 line:-1 align:center
And as an added bonus,


166
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,498 line:-2
it aligns the ergonomics of the
screen


167
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:15,235 line:-2
with the expected frequency
of actions.


168
00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:19.573 line:-2 align:center
Taking a picture is to generate
a new recipe in my Recipes page.


169
00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.175 line:-1 align:center
It's an important feature.


170
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,378 line:-2
So, we put
a prominent button at the top,


171
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,780 line:-1
before other recipes.


172
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,049 line:-2
The Search Bar
is placed on the top,


173
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,185 line:-1
for very visible access.


174
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:32,920 line:-2
We are fine with it
being further


175
00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:34.421 line:-1 align:center
to reach for my thumb


176
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,690 line:-2
because we imagine it
as an action


177
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,358 line:-1
people use less frequently,


178
00:07:38.392 --> 00:07:41.862 line:-1 align:center
relative to our tab bar actions.


179
00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:43.864 line:-2 align:center
The rest of the features
from our list


180
00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:46.366 line:-2 align:center
relate to my personal
preferences,


181
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.536 line:-2 align:center
so we put them into
the Profile icon on the top.


182
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,939 line:-2
My preferences
do not change frequently,


183
00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:56.476 line:-2 align:center
so it's OK if it takes
an additional tap to get there.


184
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.378 line:-1 align:center
To summarize this section,


185
00:07:58.412 --> 00:08:01.515 line:-1 align:center
prioritize important features,


186
00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:05.485 line:-2 align:center
make the essential features
immediately visible.


187
00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:08.922 line:-2 align:center
To make other actions
and navigation discoverable,


188
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:12,726 line:-2
use visual cues
to direct attention.


189
00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:15.295 line:-2 align:center
Visual cues are elements
that guide people


190
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,032 line:-2
toward a particular
piece of content or action.


191
00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:20.701 line:-1 align:center
How we think about visual cues


192
00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:24.204 line:-2 align:center
begins with knowing
your audience.


193
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,572 line:-1
Knowing your audience is key


194
00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:27.741 line:-1 align:center
because it helps you understand


195
00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:29.643 line:-1 align:center
what needs to be spelled out


196
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:33.046 line:-2 align:center
and what can
be inferred by people.


197
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,416 line:-2
First, think about,
who is your product for?


198
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.085 line:-1 align:center
In the case of Toasty,


199
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,787 line:-1
our product is for toast lovers,


200
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,056 line:-2
who might not be
professional chefs,


201
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,459 line:-2
but still want to make
tasty toast on their own


202
00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:47.761 line:-1 align:center
with the help of a recipe.


203
00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:50.330 line:-2 align:center
Toasty is an app
for a general audience,


204
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,032 line:-1
not a professional tool.


205
00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:53.667 line:-1 align:center
So, there is not much tolerance


206
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,637 line:-2
for spending time and effort
to learn this app.


207
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.640 line:-2 align:center
As in,
people are unlikely to want


208
00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:01.608 line:-1 align:center
or think it's necessary


209
00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:04.178 line:-2 align:center
to have extensive
how-to instructions,


210
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,247 line:-2
like a multi-step
onboarding tutorial.


211
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,816 line:-2
We want to provide
as many visual cues


212
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,753 line:-2
that clue them
into how to use the app


213
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,322 line:-1
while they're using it, instead.


214
00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:18.725 line:-2 align:center
So, we ask,
what do people know already?


215
00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:21.528 line:-2 align:center
We assume people
can infer this icon


216
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,598 line:-2
relates to toast because,
as toast lovers,


217
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,166 line:-1
they've naturally come across


218
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.303 line:-1 align:center
bread that resembles that shape.


219
00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:32.272 line:-2 align:center
Our icon is tied
to the physical world.


220
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,207 line:-1
But, hey!


221
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,376 line:-2
It's not just people's physical,
lived experiences


222
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.811 line:-1 align:center
we can count on.


223
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:41,815 line:-2
We can expect some familiarity
with common digital patterns


224
00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:44.518 line:-1 align:center
because most people using Toasty


225
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.753 line:-1 align:center
aren't new to having a phone.


226
00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:51.625 line:-2 align:center
For example, people using iOS
associate the action


227
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:55,028 line:-2
of going to a previous screen
with tapping a chevron


228
00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:57.998 line:-2 align:center
on the top left
of the navigation view.


229
00:09:58.031 --> 00:10:00.300 line:-2 align:center
Because people are familiar
with this interaction,


230
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:02,836 line:-2
we don't need to add
extra visual cues.


231
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,573 line:-2
If you are building unique
designs or interactions


232
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,675 line:-2
that people may not
be familiar with,


233
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:12,212 line:-2
you should include words
or on-screen elements


234
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,848 line:-2
that help people understand
what to do.


235
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,118 line:-2
Even recognizable icons
can be vague.


236
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,786 line:-1
Is that a book?


237
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.655 line:-1 align:center
A favorite newspaper?


238
00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:23.223 line:-1 align:center
By adding labels,


239
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:26,093 line:-2
we clarify the meaning
of each icon:


240
00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.729 line:-2 align:center
to browse
suggested kinds of toast,


241
00:10:28.762 --> 00:10:31.665 line:-1 align:center
to view saved recipes.


242
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,535 line:-2
Even the camera icon
that we are familiar


243
00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:36.603 line:-2 align:center
with could have
many possible uses,


244
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,639 line:-1
such as taking a picture,


245
00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:41.475 line:-2 align:center
scanning a document
or a QR code.


246
00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:44.244 line:-2 align:center
When we add text
labeling the button "New,"


247
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,714 line:-2
we clarify this button
is for capturing toast


248
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,583 line:-1
to add a new recipe.


249
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,085 line:-2
Beyond the visual cues
that make it clear


250
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,820 line:-1
what the action will be,


251
00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:57.224 line:-2 align:center
you can also provide visual cues
that help people understand


252
00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:59.193 line:-1 align:center
how to make use of that action.


253
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,895 line:-2
Take the search bar,
for example.


254
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:05,566 line:-2
People are familiar enough
with the search icon and action,


255
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,769 line:-2
but draw a blank
on what to write,


256
00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:11.038 line:-1 align:center
because we haven't clued them in


257
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:13.473 line:-1 align:center
on how to search in the app.


258
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:17,010 line:-2
We call this
the blank page problem.


259
00:11:17.044 --> 00:11:18.445 line:-1 align:center
When you create things,


260
00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:21.582 line:-2 align:center
presenting people with a giant,
blank white screen


261
00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:23.317 line:-1 align:center
can lead to indecision


262
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.018 line:-1 align:center
because people don't know


263
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,553 line:-1
what they want to make


264
00:11:26.587 --> 00:11:29.056 line:-2 align:center
when there's nothing
in front of them.


265
00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:30.290 line:-2 align:center
It's something
you can get around


266
00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:32.893 line:-2 align:center
by guiding people
with various options.


267
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.529 line:-2 align:center
So, we decided
to provide examples


268
00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:37.831 line:-1 align:center
of possible types of input,


269
00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:42.202 line:-2 align:center
such as searching by
ingredients, places, or friends.


270
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:44,771 line:-2
In this way,
people can quickly discover


271
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,341 line:-2
different methods
for how to search.


272
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,977 line:-2
Besides guiding people
with words and visuals,


273
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,213 line:-2
you could also use
animation and interactivity


274
00:11:53.247 --> 00:11:56.583 line:-2 align:center
to teach gradually
and in context.


275
00:11:56.617 --> 00:11:58.418 line:-1 align:center
In Toasty, for example,


276
00:11:58.452 --> 00:12:01.321 line:-2 align:center
we have the ability
to scan real toast,


277
00:12:01.355 --> 00:12:04.157 line:-2 align:center
using the camera
to generate a recipe


278
00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:05.359 line:-1 align:center
and set a cover photo


279
00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:06.793 line:-2 align:center
for that recipe.
[pop]


280
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,328 line:-1
It's a unique feature,


281
00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:12.299 line:-2 align:center
so we'll have to guide people
through how to do this.


282
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,433 line:-1
[ringing]


283
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,737 line:-2
The toast outline hints at
keeping the toast in the center


284
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,306 line:-1
and a certain distance away.


285
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,208 line:-1
Before you have toast in view,


286
00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.610 line:-2 align:center
the shutter button
is deactivated,


287
00:12:23.644 --> 00:12:24.811 line:-1 align:center
and we let you know


288
00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:27.214 line:-2 align:center
it's because the camera
is looking for toast.


289
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,450 line:-2
When a camera
is at the right angle,


290
00:12:30.484 --> 00:12:32.452 line:-2 align:center
the outline visually changes.
[ringing]


291
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,354 line:-2
And then,
there's haptic feedback


292
00:12:34.388 --> 00:12:36.323 line:-2 align:center
to indicate
the recommended moment


293
00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:37.991 line:-1 align:center
to take a picture of your toast.


294
00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:38.859 line:-1 align:center
[camera shutter clicks]


295
00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:41.328 line:-1 align:center
These animations and visual cues


296
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,631 line:-2
help ensure people
get our instructions,


297
00:12:44.665 --> 00:12:47.234 line:-1 align:center
when the info is relevant,


298
00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:50.270 line:-2 align:center
instead of early on
in the onboarding.


299
00:12:50.704 --> 00:12:51.805 line:-1 align:center
So, design your app


300
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,540 line:-1
by considering what knowledge


301
00:12:53.574 --> 00:12:55.676 line:-1 align:center
people are already equipped with


302
00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:59.346 line:-2 align:center
and when they need
an extra helping hand.


303
00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:02.082 line:-1 align:center
Number three, hint at gestures.


304
00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.351 line:-2 align:center
Making use of gestures
in your app


305
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,654 line:-2
will make your app feel
more fluid and responsive


306
00:13:07.688 --> 00:13:11.892 line:-2 align:center
than navigating through
with only discrete taps.


307
00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:14.261 line:-1 align:center
Gestures are great as shortcuts


308
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,697 line:-2
to certain actions
or navigation,


309
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,198 line:-1
but are invisible,


310
00:13:18.232 --> 00:13:21.568 line:-2 align:center
and so might not be
as immediately discoverable.


311
00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:24.538 line:-1 align:center
First, as a general rule,


312
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,908 line:-2
use the accepted gesture for the
platform.


313
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:29.877 line:-2 align:center
If you're inventing
a new gesture,


314
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.313 line:-2 align:center
try to mimic
real-life interactions.


315
00:13:33.347 --> 00:13:34.815 line:-2 align:center
People can have a hard time


316
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:38,619 line:-2
learning new gestures
that do familiar interactions.


317
00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:40.954 line:-2 align:center
In games
and other immersive apps,


318
00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:44.491 line:-2 align:center
custom gestures can be
a fun part of the experience.


319
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:47,828 line:-2
In other apps, it's best
to use standard gestures,


320
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,464 line:-1
so extra effort isn't needed


321
00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.299 line:-1 align:center
to discover or remember them.


322
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,638 line:-2
Some standard gestures
are Tap, Swipe, Long Press,


323
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,240 line:-1
Pan, Pinch, and Rotate.


324
00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:03.110 line:-2 align:center
People generally expect
these standard gestures


325
00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:07.347 line:-2 align:center
to work the same across
the system and in every app.


326
00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:10.284 line:-2 align:center
Some experiences
don't have standard gestures.


327
00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:11.451 line:-1 align:center
If they are new,


328
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:15,856 line:-2
make sure to align interactions
with real-world behaviors.


329
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:19,693 line:-2
For example,
in Scribble with Apple Pencil,


330
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,564 line:-2
we can scratch out the text
that you want to delete.


331
00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:25.999 line:-2 align:center
The gesture works the same
way in the real world


332
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,101 line:-2
to create
a familiar interaction.


333
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:31,271 line:-1
In my recipes, we use pinch


334
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,073 line:-1
to show more recipes,


335
00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:36.410 line:-2 align:center
similar to the Photos app that
uses the same gesture


336
00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:39.112 line:-1 align:center
to pinch to show more photos.


337
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:42,182 line:-2
People should be familiar
with this standard gesture.


338
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,952 line:-2
But even some gestures
that people are familiar with


339
00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:46.420 line:-1 align:center
can be confusing.


340
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:47,354 line:-1
For example,


341
00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.523 line:-2 align:center
people who heavily use
social media apps


342
00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:52.659 line:-2 align:center
might be familiar
with Double Tap to Like.


343
00:14:52.693 --> 00:14:55.863 line:-2 align:center
But people who use
a lot of Photos and Maps


344
00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:59.132 line:-2 align:center
might expect
Double Tap to zoom in.


345
00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:00.667 line:-1 align:center
In designing Toasty,


346
00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:03.737 line:-2 align:center
we show a clear "Like" icon
for Tap to Like,


347
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.508 line:-2 align:center
but also include the Double Tap
gesture as a shortcut.


348
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,544 line:-1
This leads to the second point.


349
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:14,948 line:-2
Use gestures as a shortcut,
not a replacement.


350
00:15:14.982 --> 00:15:16.950 line:-1 align:center
Because gestures,


351
00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:19.686 line:-2 align:center
no matter how intuitive
they might be,


352
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.488 line:-1 align:center
are still invisible.


353
00:15:21.522 --> 00:15:24.124 line:-2 align:center
If there's no way
to look at interface


354
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,159 line:-1
and know how to use a gesture,


355
00:15:26.193 --> 00:15:29.530 line:-2 align:center
then treat a gesture
as an accelerator.


356
00:15:29.563 --> 00:15:32.065 line:-2 align:center
You should still have
a primary way


357
00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:36.603 line:-2 align:center
to perform the same action
that is clearly legible.


358
00:15:36.637 --> 00:15:40.107 line:-2 align:center
And third,
make gestures more discoverable


359
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,242 line:-2
through your animated
transitions.


360
00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:44.077 line:-1 align:center
In my recipes,


361
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,447 line:-2
we could tap a toast
to see its recipe.


362
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:49.216 line:-1 align:center
To get back to all the recipes,


363
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,785 line:-1
we use swipe down as a shortcut.


364
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,488 line:-2
Similar to the Photos app,
where you can swipe down


365
00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:58.859 line:-2 align:center
to go back to all photos
from viewing one photo.


366
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,394 line:-2
Even though
it's a common gesture,


367
00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:03.096 line:-2 align:center
we kept an explicit
button to go back


368
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,433 line:-2
because we can't assume
everybody knows this gesture.


369
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,836 line:-1
And gestures have directions.


370
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:10,771 line:-2
Tapping the back chevron
still triggers


371
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,506 line:-1
a sliding down animation,


372
00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:16.243 line:-2 align:center
which hints that you can
also swipe down to go back.


373
00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:19.479 line:-2 align:center
So, ensure your transitions are
consistent


374
00:16:19.513 --> 00:16:22.516 line:-2 align:center
with the motion
of the associated gesture.


375
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,119 line:-2
We want to let people
navigate between recipes


376
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,589 line:-1
by swiping left or right.


377
00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:30.490 line:-1 align:center
But just by looking at a screen,


378
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:34,061 line:-2
people wouldn't know
they can do that.


379
00:16:34.094 --> 00:16:36.096 line:-1 align:center
So, let's give a visual cue,


380
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,533 line:-2
by adding the smaller toast
images on either side.


381
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:44,471 line:-1
To summarize this section,


382
00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:47.374 line:-1 align:center
use standard iOS gestures,


383
00:16:47.407 --> 00:16:51.078 line:-2 align:center
or gestures that are similar
to real-life interactions.


384
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:56,083 line:-2
Provide a primary, legible way
to perform the same action.


385
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:59,786 line:-2
And use animation
to hint at gestures.


386
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.823 line:-2 align:center
These are three methods
to improve discoverability,


387
00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:05.792 line:-2 align:center
by ensuring people can
easily move through your app,


388
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,128 line:-2
can understand
what actions are available,


389
00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:11.665 line:-2 align:center
and can learn how to do so
in the moment.


390
00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:14.001 line:-1 align:center
As general principles,


391
00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:15.869 line:-1 align:center
when people use your app,


392
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:18,906 line:-2
they should be able to know
what to do immediately,


393
00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:21.475 line:-2 align:center
without having
to touch the screen.


394
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,777 line:-2
Try to understand
how people know things.


395
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.913 line:-2 align:center
Do they know this
from the real world?


396
00:17:25.946 --> 00:17:27.681 line:-1 align:center
Do they know this from iOS?


397
00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:31.385 line:-2 align:center
Do they know this because
they've used our app before?


398
00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:33.086 line:-1 align:center
Next, my colleague, MylÃ¨ne,


399
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,257 line:-2
will speak to discoverability
for content.


400
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,193 line:-1
[MylÃ¨ne] Thank you, Jiabao!


401
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,295 line:-2
Making the functionality
of your application


402
00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:42.596 line:-1 align:center
easy to understand


403
00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:44.665 line:-2 align:center
will be pointless
if people cannot find


404
00:17:44.698 --> 00:17:46.500 line:-2 align:center
the content
they are looking for.


405
00:17:47.034 --> 00:17:50.204 line:-2 align:center
The best apps have features
you know how to use


406
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,739 line:-2
and content
you know how to navigate.


407
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:56,143 line:-2
The core content of Toasty,
is toast recipes.


408
00:17:56.176 --> 00:17:58.679 line:-1 align:center
A lot of them. Hundreds!


409
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:02,249 line:-2
And people will keep
adding recipes, so, eventually,


410
00:18:02.282 --> 00:18:03.584 line:-1 align:center
we'll have thousands.


411
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,886 line:-1
With that much content,


412
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,788 line:-2
how are we going to ensure
people can discover


413
00:18:07.821 --> 00:18:09.790 line:-1 align:center
the kinds of toast they want?


414
00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:12.226 line:-1 align:center
To answer that question,


415
00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:14.728 line:-1 align:center
here's our fourth principle:


416
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.897 line:-1 align:center
organize by behavior.


417
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.332 line:-2 align:center
Organize the content of your app


418
00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:20.767 line:-2 align:center
into categories
that fits people's motivation


419
00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:22.736 line:-1 align:center
and natural behavior.


420
00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:26.306 line:-2 align:center
Let's start by choosing
what these categories are.


421
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,775 line:-2
We think people
get very excited about


422
00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:31.645 line:-2 align:center
what kind of topping or
unique ingredient combinations


423
00:18:31.678 --> 00:18:34.314 line:-2 align:center
they would like to find
on a toast.


424
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:37,217 line:-2
So, naturally, when choosing
categories for our app,


425
00:18:37.251 --> 00:18:39.586 line:-2 align:center
we decided
to organize by ingredients.


426
00:18:40.087 --> 00:18:41.555 line:-2 align:center
People can
have grouped selections


427
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:45,025 line:-1
of avocado or blueberry toast.


428
00:18:45.058 --> 00:18:48.228 line:-2 align:center
But that doesn't
scale well because


429
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:51,932 line:-2
there are just too many
possible ingredients.


430
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,402 line:-2
It is a legitimate choice
to categorize by ingredient.


431
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:58,405 line:-2
There are tons of different ways
to organize content,


432
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:02,042 line:-2
and we know how difficult
it can be to make choices.


433
00:19:02.075 --> 00:19:04.545 line:-2 align:center
But this isn't helping
make a decision


434
00:19:04.578 --> 00:19:07.414 line:-2 align:center
about the pieces of toast
people want to try next.


435
00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:11.485 line:-2 align:center
The amount of ingredients
categories is overwhelming.


436
00:19:11.518 --> 00:19:13.320 line:-2 align:center
With Toasty,
we want to help people


437
00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:17.257 line:-2 align:center
explore and discover
new toast recipes.


438
00:19:17.291 --> 00:19:19.426 line:-2 align:center
So, we put ourself
in the position


439
00:19:19.459 --> 00:19:22.296 line:-1 align:center
of the people using our app.


440
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,932 line:-2
How would people
discover toast in real life?


441
00:19:24.965 --> 00:19:26.767 line:-1 align:center
In what context?


442
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.436 line:-2 align:center
What is people's behavior
regarding toast?


443
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,405 line:-1
Well, they find new toast


444
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,207 line:-1
when they try new restaurants


445
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.843 line:-1 align:center
or when friends recommend them.


446
00:19:35.876 --> 00:19:38.145 line:-2 align:center
This led us to organize
recommendations


447
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,181 line:-2
based on whether
they are from restaurants


448
00:19:41.215 --> 00:19:43.684 line:-1 align:center
or shared by friends.


449
00:19:43.717 --> 00:19:46.353 line:-2 align:center
These two categories
apply to other motivations


450
00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:48.388 line:-2 align:center
than just making
a piece of toast.


451
00:19:48.422 --> 00:19:51.625 line:-2 align:center
It's about getting to know
restaurants in your area better


452
00:19:51.658 --> 00:19:53.594 line:-1 align:center
and connecting with friends.


453
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:56,230 line:-2
It is more
interesting and engaging


454
00:19:56.263 --> 00:19:59.266 line:-1 align:center
to discover content this way.


455
00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:01.368 line:-2 align:center
But we felt
we were still missing


456
00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:03.036 line:-1 align:center
one strong category


457
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.806 line:-2 align:center
that would connect with
the individual's personal taste


458
00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:08.108 line:-1 align:center
and the flavors they favor.


459
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:12,412 line:-2
That leads us
to our second point,


460
00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:15.582 line:-1 align:center
which is to use personalization.


461
00:20:15.616 --> 00:20:18.051 line:-2 align:center
Organize content
into a dedicated section


462
00:20:18.085 --> 00:20:19.353 line:-1 align:center
that will surface suggestions


463
00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:22.723 line:-2 align:center
from a machine-learning-powered
recommendation engine.


464
00:20:22.756 --> 00:20:25.459 line:-2 align:center
Because food taste
is something personal,


465
00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:28.996 line:-2 align:center
it makes sense
to personalize content.


466
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:33.000 line:-2 align:center
As I said earlier, we can't have
a category for each ingredient,


467
00:20:33.033 --> 00:20:35.636 line:-2 align:center
but we can have
a recommendation engine


468
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:38.539 line:-2 align:center
that will target people's
favorite toast recipes


469
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,674 line:-1
based on ingredients they like.


470
00:20:41.642 --> 00:20:43.977 line:-2 align:center
So, adding
to our existing categories,


471
00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:47.814 line:-2 align:center
we've created a new one
we're calling "Tasty Picks."


472
00:20:47.848 --> 00:20:50.651 line:-2 align:center
Tasty Picks
shows the best toast recipes


473
00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:54.488 line:-2 align:center
generated by our own
recommendation engine.


474
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:57,024 line:-2
For certain
types of application,


475
00:20:57.057 --> 00:21:00.027 line:-2 align:center
personalized content
can improve the app's experience


476
00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.162 line:-1 align:center
if it's implemented well.


477
00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:04.765 line:-2 align:center
Especially when dealing
with a lot of content,


478
00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:06.667 line:-2 align:center
it's possible people
could find something


479
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,168 line:-1
they might like faster.


480
00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:11.738 line:-2 align:center
And when people don't
have to type in a search bar,


481
00:21:11.772 --> 00:21:15.475 line:-2 align:center
it is usually a sign that
your content is discoverable.


482
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,478 line:-2
Once we have organized
the content into categories


483
00:21:18.512 --> 00:21:20.414 line:-1 align:center
that match people's behavior,


484
00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:23.183 line:-2 align:center
we need to visually
perceive these divisions.


485
00:21:23.217 --> 00:21:26.854 line:-2 align:center
Which brings us to the final
point about organizing content:


486
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:30,057 line:-2
visualize the content
organization


487
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.927 line:-2 align:center
by making the categories
clear at a glance.


488
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,563 line:-2
When designing
the user interface of Toasty,


489
00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:39.266 line:-2 align:center
we started by just putting
every item on screen.


490
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,669 line:-2
When we do this
with our toast recipes,


491
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:45,405 line:-2
you can already see
this is overwhelming.


492
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:48,709 line:-2
There are too many items
that are equally important.


493
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:52,679 line:-2
It becomes difficult to discover
the one you really want.


494
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:55,215 line:-2
Moreover,
without clear division,


495
00:21:55.249 --> 00:21:58.118 line:-2 align:center
people have no sense
of existing categories.


496
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:02,589 line:-2
The content is just one giant,
unsorted box of toast recipes.


497
00:22:02.623 --> 00:22:05.559 line:-2 align:center
By grouping the categories
into different logical sections,


498
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,594 line:-1
separated by a header title,


499
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:10,998 line:-2
it feels immediately
more understandable.


500
00:22:11.031 --> 00:22:13.000 line:-2 align:center
People can easily ignore
one category


501
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:16,136 line:-2
and explore deeper
in one specific section.


502
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.939 line:-2 align:center
Organize content into
categories that translates


503
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:21,875 line:-2
people's behavior
and real-life context.


504
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:23.043 line:-1 align:center
Use personalization


505
00:22:23.076 --> 00:22:26.180 line:-2 align:center
so people can more easily
find what they like.


506
00:22:26.213 --> 00:22:28.849 line:-2 align:center
Finally, visually reinforce
these categories


507
00:22:28,882 --> 00:22:31,151 line:-1
by having clear divisions.


508
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:35,088 line:-2
Now, let's move to our last
and fifth principle:


509
00:22:35.122 --> 00:22:37.324 line:-1 align:center
convey a sense of control,


510
00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:39.193 line:-2 align:center
so people know
how to easily influence


511
00:22:39.226 --> 00:22:40.627 line:-1 align:center
a machine-learning system


512
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:43,363 line:-2
and edit irrelevant
personalized content.


513
00:22:43.864 --> 00:22:46.300 line:-2 align:center
First, let people provide
explicit feedback


514
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,002 line:-1
about the item on their screen.


515
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:52,973 line:-2
Explicit feedback comes
from people's intentional input.


516
00:22:53.006 --> 00:22:54.675 line:-2 align:center
When an option exists
to tell a system


517
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,644 line:-2
about content
you want to see more or hide,


518
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:59,780 line:-1
this is explicit feedback.


519
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:02,883 line:-2
If you clearly invite people
to provide feedback,


520
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,452 line:-2
they are more likely
to give feedback.


521
00:23:05.485 --> 00:23:07.654 line:-2 align:center
This will feed
the recommendation engine's


522
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:10,657 line:-2
useful data that
will reinforce relevant items


523
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:13,460 line:-2
and discoverability
of the content.


524
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:15,963 line:-2
So, be mindful about
how you communicate


525
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:18,699 line:-2
and make these feedback
actions discoverable.


526
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,102 line:-2
After browsing
hundreds of toast,


527
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:25,072 line:-2
people eventually land
on a yummy toast page.


528
00:23:25.105 --> 00:23:27.274 line:-1 align:center
As Jiabao mentioned earlier,


529
00:23:27.307 --> 00:23:29.343 line:-2 align:center
visual cues are elements
that guide people


530
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:32,846 line:-2
toward a particular piece
of content or action.


531
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.782 line:-2 align:center
Because we want people to
tell us if they like this toast,


532
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:39,486 line:-2
we decided to use
a heart button.


533
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.455 line:-2 align:center
We showed our design
to friends and colleagues


534
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:45,459 line:-2
to find out
what is or isn't working.


535
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,427 line:-2
We quickly realized
most people thought


536
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:51,231 line:-2
this action meant
"add to favorites" rather than


537
00:23:51.265 --> 00:23:54.768 line:-2 align:center
"I would like to be recommended
more toast like this."


538
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:57.104 line:-2 align:center
The heart icon alone
doesn't help to discover


539
00:23:57.137 --> 00:23:59.006 line:-1 align:center
what this feature does.


540
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,807 line:-1
It is open to interpretation


541
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:03,143 line:-2
and not clearly indicating that
tapping on it


542
00:24:03.177 --> 00:24:05.746 line:-2 align:center
will have any consequences
on the system.


543
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,282 line:-1
Moreover, in iOS,


544
00:24:08.315 --> 00:24:10.751 line:-2 align:center
the standard is that
you can only unloved


545
00:24:10.784 --> 00:24:12.619 line:-1 align:center
once you have loved.


546
00:24:12.653 --> 00:24:16.023 line:-2 align:center
So if we can't use
the unlove icon,


547
00:24:16.056 --> 00:24:18.025 line:-2 align:center
what would be
a good input to say


548
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:21,161 line:-2
"show me less
this type of toast"?


549
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:24,665 line:-2
The iOS guidelines for
recommendation feedback icons


550
00:24:24.698 --> 00:24:27.935 line:-2 align:center
is to pair thumbs up
and thumbs down.


551
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,270 line:-1
So, we went with that.


552
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,940 line:-2
We showed this updated design
to our friends,


553
00:24:32.973 --> 00:24:35.342 line:-1 align:center
and they were still confused.


554
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,177 line:-2
It could be that,
this thumbs up meant


555
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:40,848 line:-2
other people would see
that they have liked this toast.


556
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:42.316 line:-1 align:center
They just weren't understanding


557
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,785 line:-2
that it's going to change a
recommendation engine


558
00:24:44.818 --> 00:24:46.386 line:-1 align:center
within their own iPhone.


559
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:49,823 line:-2
So, we tried even harder
to be clear and upfront


560
00:24:49.857 --> 00:24:53.160 line:-1 align:center
about the consequences.


561
00:24:53.193 --> 00:24:55.996 line:-2 align:center
Using the label
"Suggest toast like this"


562
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:57.965 line:-1 align:center
has clear consequences


563
00:24:57.998 --> 00:24:59.933 line:-1 align:center
because "Suggest" is a term


564
00:24:59.967 --> 00:25:02.135 line:-2 align:center
that is much more
closely associated


565
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,972 line:-1
with recommendation engines.


566
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,274 line:-2
Now, by just looking
at the screen,


567
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:11,144 line:-2
you know what will happen
after tapping the button "less."


568
00:25:11.178 --> 00:25:13.247 line:-2 align:center
Future recommendations
will be adapted


569
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.449 line:-1 align:center
to show less banana toast.


570
00:25:15.949 --> 00:25:18.051 line:-2 align:center
Communicating
how your system works,


571
00:25:18.085 --> 00:25:19.720 line:-1 align:center
where you can interact with it,


572
00:25:19.753 --> 00:25:22.122 line:-2 align:center
and what will result
from a person's actions


573
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:24,958 line:-2
is crucial if you want
people to easily discover


574
00:25:24.992 --> 00:25:27.628 line:-1 align:center
how to give useful feedback.


575
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:31,131 line:-2
So, now that we know how to
design feedback and actions,


576
00:25:31.164 --> 00:25:32.866 line:-1 align:center
the next step is to be mindful


577
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,869 line:-2
about the outputs
of these actions.


578
00:25:35.903 --> 00:25:37.804 line:-1 align:center
So, in order to do this,


579
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:40,407 line:-1
disclose implicit feedback.


580
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.910 line:-2 align:center
Implicit feedback
is information that arises


581
00:25:42.943 --> 00:25:45.913 line:-2 align:center
as people interact
with your app's features.


582
00:25:45.946 --> 00:25:47.681 line:-1 align:center
"Implicit" means that it happens


583
00:25:47.714 --> 00:25:50.117 line:-2 align:center
without people
consciously asking for it.


584
00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.553 line:-2 align:center
For example,
when viewing a recipe


585
00:25:52.586 --> 00:25:55.589 line:-1 align:center
or sharing toast with a friend.


586
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:57,858 line:-2
By disclosing
the implicit inputs,


587
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,161 line:-2
we inform people of the system
recommendation input source


588
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:04,431 line:-2
and, therefore, increase the
discoverability of the content


589
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:06,466 line:-2
and the understanding
of the system.


590
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.869 line:-1 align:center
In the "For You" tab of Toasty,


591
00:26:08.902 --> 00:26:11.705 line:-2 align:center
we have the section
"Tasty Picks."


592
00:26:11.738 --> 00:26:14.775 line:-2 align:center
Without an explanation,
it's difficult to understand


593
00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:17.010 line:-2 align:center
where this content
is coming from.


594
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:20,347 line:-2
Why am I seeing
these particular toast recipes?


595
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,150 line:-2
Is this curated content
from the developer themself


596
00:26:23.183 --> 00:26:25.319 line:-1 align:center
or machine learning?


597
00:26:25.352 --> 00:26:28.088 line:-2 align:center
So, after considering
these questions ourself,


598
00:26:28.121 --> 00:26:29.823 line:-1 align:center
we added a description,


599
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:32,659 line:-2
"Because you added
avocado toast."


600
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:35,329 line:-2
Adding a text label
is a simple but efficient method


601
00:26:35.362 --> 00:26:37.865 line:-1 align:center
to clarify anything on screen.


602
00:26:37.898 --> 00:26:39.633 line:-2 align:center
In this case,
it helps people know


603
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:42,169 line:-2
they'll get more
personalized recommendations


604
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:45,038 line:-2
as they add recipes
to their collection.


605
00:26:45.072 --> 00:26:48.375 line:-2 align:center
Now, what if people don't want
their added toast recipes


606
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:52,145 line:-2
to be used as an input
to get recommendation?


607
00:26:52.179 --> 00:26:54.147 line:-2 align:center
How do they edit
personalized content


608
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:56.683 line:-2 align:center
if the results are no longer
valuable,


609
00:26:56,717 --> 00:27:00,020 line:-2
or simply not as good
as expected?


610
00:27:00.053 --> 00:27:01.488 line:-1 align:center
These questions brings us


611
00:27:01.522 --> 00:27:03.090 line:-2 align:center
to the last point
of our talk today,


612
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:07,127 line:-2
which is to give control
over recommendations.


613
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.161 line:-1 align:center
Allow people to act on


614
00:27:08.195 --> 00:27:09.730 line:-2 align:center
the recommendations
they receive,


615
00:27:09.763 --> 00:27:12.399 line:-2 align:center
in case they are not happy
with the results.


616
00:27:12.432 --> 00:27:15.636 line:-2 align:center
Let me tell you a little story
to illustrate that.


617
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:18,939 line:-2
I'm used to eating
an avocado toast every morning,


618
00:27:18.972 --> 00:27:22.442 line:-2 align:center
and I get most of my recipes
from Toasty.


619
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,945 line:-2
Now, let's say I move
to a new country.


620
00:27:24.978 --> 00:27:27.414 line:-1 align:center
Everything is exciting and new,


621
00:27:27.447 --> 00:27:30.684 line:-2 align:center
but I realized one terrible
thing there:


622
00:27:30.717 --> 00:27:34.721 line:-2 align:center
I just can't find or purchase
avocados anywhere!


623
00:27:35.189 --> 00:27:36.857 line:-2 align:center
How terrible would it be
to still get


624
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,393 line:-2
delicious avocado toast
suggestion,


625
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:41,962 line:-2
when I can't get
that ingredient anymore?


626
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.734 line:-2 align:center
Yes, indeed,
that would be very frustrating.


627
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:51,538 line:-2
The app needs to stop showing
me what I can't have.


628
00:27:52.539 --> 00:27:54.975 line:-2 align:center
For this reason,
you should allow recommendations


629
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,312 line:-2
to be edited
so people feel in control.


630
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:01,415 line:-2
Allow them to act on something
that is frustrating


631
00:28:01.448 --> 00:28:03.450 line:-1 align:center
and that they want to correct.


632
00:28:03.483 --> 00:28:06.987 line:-2 align:center
But most importantly,
make that action easy to find


633
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.722 line:-1 align:center
and quick to perform.


634
00:28:10.123 --> 00:28:12.392 line:-1 align:center
In the "Tasty Picks" section,


635
00:28:12.426 --> 00:28:13.727 line:-1 align:center
next to the description


636
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.029 line:-2 align:center
"Because you added
avocado toast,"


637
00:28:16.063 --> 00:28:18.565 line:-2 align:center
we've put
a "More Options" button.


638
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,701 line:-2
By doing so, people know
they can act directly


639
00:28:20.734 --> 00:28:22.569 line:-1 align:center
on the recommendation.


640
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:25,439 line:-2
But from the perspective
of discoverability,


641
00:28:25.472 --> 00:28:28.342 line:-2 align:center
you should already sense
something wrong here.


642
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:31,245 line:-2
We've hidden everything
behind a "More Options" menu,


643
00:28:31.278 --> 00:28:33.514 line:-1 align:center
where people might not find it.


644
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:37,017 line:-2
Maybe we should try to be
even more descriptive?


645
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,119 line:-1
So, for our last design,


646
00:28:39.152 --> 00:28:41.255 line:-2 align:center
we simply added a green text
button,


647
00:28:41.288 --> 00:28:43.824 line:-2 align:center
right at the end
of the descriptions, that says


648
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:47,394 line:-1
"edit suggestion."


649
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:49,196 line:-1
After tapping on that button,


650
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:51,765 line:-2
different options
are presented to people.


651
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:53,834 line:-1
"Suggest Less Avocado Toast"


652
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:56,737 line:-2
and
"Stop Suggesting Avocado Toast."


653
00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.939 line:-2 align:center
By just reading
the button label,


654
00:28:58.972 --> 00:29:01.375 line:-2 align:center
people should
easily understand what to do


655
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,178 line:-2
and perceive what would result
from both actions.


656
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:06,613 line:-1
By using a thumbs-down icon,


657
00:29:06.647 --> 00:29:09.516 line:-2 align:center
the same way as we do
for the explicit feedback,


658
00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:10.951 line:-2 align:center
we show people
that these buttons


659
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:14,288 line:-2
have the same outcomes
as ones elsewhere in our app,


660
00:29:14.321 --> 00:29:17.124 line:-2 align:center
which is to show more
or less of certain content.


661
00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:19.793 line:-1 align:center
So, use descriptive labels


662
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:23,630 line:-2
and use icons to help clarify
or emphasize the description.


663
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:26,567 line:-2
Some people might want
to provide even more


664
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.837 line:-2 align:center
specific feedback than just
"suggest less avocado toast"


665
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,206 line:-2
and "stop suggesting
avocado toast."


666
00:29:32.239 --> 00:29:35.075 line:-2 align:center
I mean,
there are many situations where


667
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,177 line:-2
"suggest less"
or "stop suggesting"


668
00:29:37.211 --> 00:29:41.148 line:-2 align:center
aren't exactly how I want
to change my recommendations.


669
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:43,483 line:-2
Maybe people are just not
in the mood


670
00:29:43.517 --> 00:29:46.386 line:-2 align:center
for avocado
on this particular day.


671
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,089 line:-2
They might want to see
different recommendations today,


672
00:29:49.122 --> 00:29:52.960 line:-2 align:center
but still be suggested
avocado toast in the future.


673
00:29:52,993 --> 00:29:55,762 line:-2
Or maybe they just
don't like one specific item


674
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,264 line:-1
in "Tasty Picks"


675
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,633 line:-1
and would like to remove it.


676
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,504 line:-1
For the sake of discoverability,


677
00:30:03.537 --> 00:30:06.707 line:-2 align:center
it's fair to debate exactly
what kind of feedback to provide


678
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,408 line:-1
to a recommendation engine


679
00:30:08.442 --> 00:30:10.777 line:-1 align:center
and how to label those actions.


680
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,980 line:-2
Even Jiabao and I
have different opinions


681
00:30:13.013 --> 00:30:15.582 line:-2 align:center
on which controls
would be best here.


682
00:30:15.616 --> 00:30:16.583 line:-1 align:center
So, to be confident


683
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:19,286 line:-2
when making such difficult
design decisions,


684
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,121 line:-1
make a prototype of your app,


685
00:30:21.154 --> 00:30:23.957 line:-2 align:center
show it to people,
and learn from their feedback.


686
00:30:23.991 --> 00:30:27.561 line:-2 align:center
Repeat the process until
you are happy with the result.


687
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:29,630 line:-1
Here is what we discussed


688
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:32,299 line:-2
for the fifth and final
principle.


689
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,234 line:-2
People should feel and have
control


690
00:30:34.268 --> 00:30:36.670 line:-2 align:center
over your app
personalized content.


691
00:30:36.703 --> 00:30:38.238 line:-2 align:center
They should be able
to quickly understand


692
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:39,940 line:-2
what explicit feedback
to provide


693
00:30:39.973 --> 00:30:42.075 line:-2 align:center
and how to edit
or remove content


694
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,011 line:-1
they don't value anymore.


695
00:30:44.044 --> 00:30:45.679 line:-1 align:center
Let's recap the five principles


696
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:47,414 line:-2
to make your app
more discoverable.


697
00:30:48.615 --> 00:30:51.285 line:-1 align:center
Prioritize important features.


698
00:30:51.318 --> 00:30:55.455 line:-2 align:center
Have the essential features
of your app immediately visible.


699
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:57,457 line:-1
Provide visual cues.


700
00:30:57,491 --> 00:30:59,493 line:-1
Use words to disambiguate.


701
00:30:59.526 --> 00:31:03.597 line:-2 align:center
Teach in context with animations
and interactivity.


702
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.265 line:-1 align:center
Hint at gestures:


703
00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:08.669 line:-2 align:center
make gestures discoverable
by using animations.


704
00:31:08.702 --> 00:31:12.105 line:-2 align:center
Use standard gestures
as much as possible.


705
00:31:12.139 --> 00:31:14.074 line:-1 align:center
If using custom gestures,


706
00:31:14,107 --> 00:31:17,077 line:-2
provide a legible way
to perform the same action.


707
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.946 line:-1 align:center
Organize by behavior.


708
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:20,647 line:-2
When dealing
with a lot of content,


709
00:31:20.681 --> 00:31:22.816 line:-1 align:center
categorize by people's behavior.


710
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.918 line:-2 align:center
Visually organize
these categories


711
00:31:24.952 --> 00:31:26.920 line:-2 align:center
and use personalization
in order for people


712
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:29,089 line:-1
to quickly find what they want.


713
00:31:29.122 --> 00:31:32.960 line:-2 align:center
And finally,
convey a sense of control.


714
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:35,295 line:-1
Make sure people are in control.


715
00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:39.032 line:-2 align:center
Allow them to make corrections
and edit personalized content.


716
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,069 line:-2
You can have
the most innovative app,


717
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:44,738 line:-2
with the most polished
custom icons.


718
00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:46.373 line:-1 align:center
But when using your app,


719
00:31:46.406 --> 00:31:48.775 line:-2 align:center
if people get lost
or don't understand


720
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:52,813 line:-2
what those beautiful icons mean,
they might get confused.


721
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:54,047 line:-1
You have worked very hard


722
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:56,383 line:-2
to build your app's features and
content,


723
00:31:56.416 --> 00:31:58.919 line:-2 align:center
so you really want
people to find them.


724
00:31:59.586 --> 00:32:01.321 line:-1 align:center
As general principle,


725
00:32:01.355 --> 00:32:03.090 line:-1 align:center
when people use your app,


726
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:06,126 line:-2
they should be able to know
what to do immediately.


727
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,530 line:-2
Even without having
to touch the screen.


728
00:32:09,563 --> 00:32:12,966 line:-2
Think about your audience,
and what they might know.


729
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.202 line:-1 align:center
Do they know this icon from iOS,


730
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:18,071 line:-2
or do they understand this
symbol from the real world?


731
00:32:20.073 --> 00:32:22.943 line:-2 align:center
Great design requires
trial and error.


732
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:25,746 line:-2
So, make things,
show them to people,


733
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,181 line:-1
and learn from their feedback.


734
00:32:29.183 --> 00:32:31.919 line:-2 align:center
If you are interested to know
more about design principles


735
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:34,755 line:-2
and how to make apps
that feel fluid to use,


736
00:32:34.788 --> 00:32:37.257 line:-2 align:center
here are some videos
we recommend.


737
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,158 line:-1
Thank you for watching!
