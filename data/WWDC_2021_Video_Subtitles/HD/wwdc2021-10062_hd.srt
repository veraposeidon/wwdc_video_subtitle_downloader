Mathieu Tozer:
Hi, I'm Mathieu Tozer,


7
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,515 line:-1
and I'm an engineer
on the macOS SwiftUI team.


8
00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.919 line:-1 position:50%
SwiftUI is a multiplatform
framework at its core,


9
00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.656 line:-1 position:50%
with the goal of making it easy
to build great apps everywhere.


10
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,392 line:-1
When approaching
any new concept or API,


11
00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.194 line:-1 position:50%
we take a step back and consider


12
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,831 line:-1
what each platform
expects from that feature.


13
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:33,734 line:-1
What's great about SwiftUI
is that its APIs and concepts


14
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,636 line:-1
apply to all platforms,


15
00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:37.070 line:-1 position:50%
and in this talk
we're going to show


16
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.173 line:-1 position:50%
how those are fine-tuned
for the Mac.


17
00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:41.241 line:-1 position:50%
This is a code-along,


18
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.410 line:-1 position:50%
where you'll be downloading
a skeleton project


19
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,979 line:-1
and writing a Mac app with me.


20
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,882 line:-1
Before we start, let's look over
some of the key principles


21
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,251 line:-1
that go into great Mac apps
that we'll refer back to


22
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.921 line:-1 position:50%
while working on our app.


23
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:59,026 line:-1
These are flexible, familiar,
expansive, and precise.


24
00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:00.727 line:-1 position:50%
Mac Apps are flexible,


25
00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:04.164 line:-1 position:50%
adjusting to how each of us
individually use them.


26
00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.300 line:-1 position:50%
This starts with how
we physically use our Macs


27
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.104 line:-1 position:50%
from keyboards, mice, trackpads,
switch controls, even iPads --


28
00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.341 line:-1 position:50%
and then extends
to the software itself.


29
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,911 line:-1
I can customize my workflow
by adjusting table columns,


30
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.114 line:-1 position:50%
sidebars, detail panels,
display modes,


31
00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.583 line:-1 position:50%
and windows in a way
that suits me best,


32
00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.019 line:-1 position:50%
and the interface will adapt.


33
00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:29.189 line:-1 position:50%
And at the same time,
Mac apps are familiar.


34
00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.224 line:-1 position:50%
Using controls
and design patterns


35
00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:33.226 line:-1 position:50%
consistent with the system
makes an app


36
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:37,831 line:-1
immediately approachable, thanks
to a common visual language.


37
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.534 line:-1 position:50%
For example, the File menu
is where I always reach


38
00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:42.769 line:-1 position:50%
to create new things,
and the search bar


39
00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:47.574 line:-1 position:50%
has a consistent look
across all my app toolbars.


40
00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.376 line:-1 position:50%
You can make your app
more approachable


41
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,378 line:-1
by zoning out areas of a window,


42
00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:54.081 line:-1 position:50%
keeping navigation
and hierarchy in the sidebar,


43
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.482 line:-1 position:50%
content in the center,


44
00:01:55.482 --> 00:02:00.187 line:-1 position:50%
and user functions along the top
and right-hand side.


45
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:03,123 line:-1
But that consistency can still
leave room for apps to be unique


46
00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.624 line:-1 position:50%
and stand out among others.


47
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,462 line:-1
You can add customization,
such as the app accent color.


48
00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:10.564 line:-1 position:50%
And when you find you need
a custom control,


49
00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:14.301 line:-1 position:50%
it should be designed to fit in
with the system controls.


50
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,670 line:-1
Mac apps are expansive.


51
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,573 line:-1
Large, often multiple displays
mean more information


52
00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:22.275 line:-1 position:50%
can be organized on screen
without being hidden away


53
00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:25.078 line:-1 position:50%
in drill-in style
navigation stacks.


54
00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:28.281 line:-1 position:50%
Concretely, expansive means
using controls like sidebars


55
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.817 line:-1 position:50%
with outline views
and thumbnail previews,


56
00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.953 line:-1 position:50%
popovers for transient elements,


57
00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:35.389 line:-1 position:50%
tabs to toggle between
panes of controls,


58
00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.625 line:-1 position:50%
and disclosure groups
to display content.


59
00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.995 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, Mac apps are precise.


60
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.997 line:-1 position:50%
They not only have
large windows,


61
00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.000 line:-1 position:50%
but their views also have
tighter margins and spacing


62
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.070 line:-1 position:50%
that results in high densities
of content and controls,


63
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.207 line:-1 position:50%
and these controls are designed
to be used with a mouse pointer.


64
00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:57.411 line:-1 position:50%
All that said, increased density
doesn't need to result


65
00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.079 line:-1 position:50%
in increased complexity;


66
00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.314 line:-1 position:50%
an app that serves a simple,
single purpose


67
00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:04.217 line:-1 position:50%
can still be a great Mac app.


68
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,752 line:-1
You probably recognize
these ideas


69
00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.821 line:-1 position:50%
from your favorite Mac apps.


70
00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:11.058 line:-1 position:50%
We'll next be applying
these ideas in practice.


71
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,660 line:-1
I'm going to be building
a Mac app with you.


72
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.096 line:-1 position:50%
Hit Pause here and
download the project,


73
00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:19.966 line:-1 position:50%
which will contain the starting
and end points for this session.


74
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,568 line:-1
I really like to garden.


75
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,737 line:-1
I think it would be great
to have a dedicated app


76
00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:26.940 line:-1 position:50%
to track my gardens
over the years.


77
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,809 line:-1
We're going to build this app
for the Mac.


78
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,544 line:-1
We'll take advantage
of platform features


79
00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:33.547 line:-1 position:50%
such as flexible windowing
and high information density,


80
00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.849 line:-1 position:50%
enabling me to really interact
with my app's data


81
00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.718 line:-1 position:50%
in a way that feels great
on macOS.


82
00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.053 line:-1 position:50%
On the left, I have a sidebar


83
00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.323 line:-1 position:50%
showing an outline view
of all my garden projects.


84
00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.159 line:-1 position:50%
I can select a garden
and see all the plant details


85
00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.663 line:-1 position:50%
in a table view,
or as a gallery.


86
00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:51.665 line:-1 position:50%
Let's start implementing
this app.


87
00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:55.936 line:-1 position:50%
Open up the Session1.workspace
in the starter project.


88
00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:59.106 line:-1 position:50%
We have a garden structure that
contains an array of plants,


89
00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:02.042 line:-1 position:50%
and we have some views and
helpers to speed us along,


90
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,778 line:-1
but we'll get started
in the ContentView.


91
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,079 line:-1
I'm just going
to collapse my sidebar


92
00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.383 line:-1 position:50%
and make some room
for my Xcode previews.


93
00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.719 line:-1 position:50%
Our Mac app will have
a two-column layout.


94
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,789 line:-1
I'm going to embed this text view
in a NavigationView.


95
00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.591 line:-1 position:50%
I'm going to remove
the padding,


96
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:22.395 line:-1 position:50%
and I'll change the text
to a Sidebar.


97
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,198 line:-1
The second column
will be for our Plant Table.


98
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,901 line:-1
This flattened hierarchy
provides a solid foundation


99
00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:29.703 line:-1 position:50%
for an expansive
navigation experience


100
00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:32.606 line:-1 position:50%
on the Mac's big screens.


101
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,708 line:-1
Let's get going
on our sidebar.


102
00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:37.177 line:-1 position:50%
If I Command-click,
I can extract this view


103
00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:43.617 line:-1 position:50%
into its own subview,
and I'll rename it to "Sidebar".


104
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,619 line:-1
I need access to my store.


105
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:52,926 position:50%
And I want to show a list of my
gardens in the current year.


106
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,200 position:50%
And we'll show each garden's
name in a label


107
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,037 position:50%
with the leaf systemImage.


108
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,473 line:-1
I'd like to be able to see
which gardens are current,


109
00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.575 line:-1 position:50%
put the history
in its own section,


110
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,076 line:-1
and then control precisely
what I see


111
00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:13.647 line:-1 position:50%
by clicking
disclosure triangles.


112
00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:14.981 line:-1 position:50%
We'll use a DisclosureGroup,


113
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,551 line:-1
which flattens our
navigation system out even more


114
00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:21.188 line:-1 position:50%
while providing a familiar way
to manage complexity.


115
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,824 position:50%
I'm going to change
the list to a ForEach,


116
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,426 position:50%
and if I Command-click,


117
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,696 position:50%
I can choose
to embed it in a list.


118
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,332 line:0
We've already got the content
we iterate over defined,


119
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,301 line:0
so we can just clear that out.


120
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.702 line:-1 position:50%
Now, this expression
is equivalent


121
00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.504 line:-1 position:50%
to what we had before,


122
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:43,944 line:-1
but now we can embed the
ForEach in a DisclosureGroup.


123
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,378 line:0
And for the systemImage,


124
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,081 line:0
well, this one's a bit of
a mouthful but here we go.


125
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:53,453 position:50%
We'll use the
chart.bar.doc.horizontal image.


126
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,355 line:-1
OK, great.
I have my gardens


127
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,390 line:-1
organized in
an outline structure,


128
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.126 line:-1 position:50%
giving me the flexibility
to control what I see.


129
00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:03.396 line:-1 position:50%
But I'd like the current group
to be open by default,


130
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,998 line:-1
and for the expansion state
to persist


131
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:09,336 line:-1
each time I open the app, which
makes my app more familiar.


132
00:06:09.336 --> 00:06:11.004 line:-1 position:50%
To save the expansionState,


133
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,441 line:-1
we'll add a property
to the Sidebar.


134
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,943 line:-1
I'll annotate it with the
@SceneStorage property wrapper,


135
00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:19.613 line:-1 position:50%
providing a key
of expansionState.


136
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,720 line:-1
This will tell SwiftUI


137
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,788 line:-1
to offload this property
when the app quits


138
00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:31.992 line:-1 position:50%
and reload it when
the window is restored.


139
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,393 position:50%
Now I'll pass a binding along


140
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,396 line:0
to the DisclosureGroup
for the current year...


141
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,670 position:50%
...and now the current group
is expanded.


142
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,272 line:-1
I think my sidebar
is a little tight,


143
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:49,442 line:-1
so I'm just going to set
a minimum width.


144
00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:57.050 line:-1 position:50%
I'll show the history
in a section,


145
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.052 line:-1 position:50%
and I'll use
a GardenHistoryOutline view


146
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,087 line:-1
I made earlier.


147
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,627 position:50%
I'll pass that expansionState
along as well.


148
00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:16.269 line:-1 position:50%
I'm going to add a badge


149
00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:21.875 line:-1 position:50%
to highlight when
my poor plants need water.


150
00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:24.611 line:-1 position:50%
OK, in order to see
the details on the right,


151
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,579 line:-1
I'll need to add selection.


152
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,751 line:-1
We'll add a binding to the ID
of the selected garden.


153
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,586 line:-1
And then we can
provide that selection


154
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,690 line:-1
as a binding to the list.


155
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.725 line:-1 position:50%
The Sidebar's parent,
the ContentView,


156
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,093 line:-1
will hold on to the value,


157
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:44,064 line:-1
passing down bindings
to the sidebar and the table.


158
00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:46.666 line:-1 position:50%
So I'm going to copy this
up here, too,


159
00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:49.869 line:-1 position:50%
and I'm going to pop it into
@SceneStorage


160
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:52.639 line:-1 position:50%
so that it will persist
between runs.


161
00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:04.584 line:-1 position:50%
And I'll pass it along
to the Sidebar as well.


162
00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:06.553 line:-1 position:50%
I think my sidebar
is looking good.


163
00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:09.089 line:-1 position:50%
I can control what I see
with disclosure triangles,


164
00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:11.458 line:-1 position:50%
and if my Mac restarts,
things will be restored


165
00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:13.860 line:-1 position:50%
to just how I left it.


166
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,430 line:-1
We can get started on
the GardenDetail view now.


167
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,769 line:-1
It takes a binding
to the selection as well.


168
00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.137 line:-1 position:50%
And if I Command-click,


169
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:29,008 line:-1
I can jump to
the definition of the view.


170
00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:31.611 line:-1 position:50%
This view already contains
properties to our store


171
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.747 line:-1 position:50%
and some others
we'll use shortly.


172
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,216 line:0
It's also set up to show
the garden's name and year


173
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:39,586 position:50%
as the navigationTitle
and Subtitle.


174
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:46,159 line:0
We'll implement the table in its
own variable on the detail view,


175
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,162 line:0
and we'll use it here
from the body.


176
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:52,766 position:50%
Let's start by simply showing
a list of the garden's plants.


177
00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.772 line:-1 position:50%
We could display
other plant properties


178
00:08:58.772 --> 00:09:02.876 line:-1 position:50%
in a horizontal stack view, but
we have a lot of data to show,


179
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,711 line:-1
and a lot of it is textual.


180
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.714 line:-1 position:50%
Also, we'd like to add
the ability to sort the plants


181
00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:11.184 line:-1 position:50%
alphabetically
or in the order we planted.


182
00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:14.020 line:-1 position:50%
For these reasons,
we'll display plants in a table.


183
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,589 line:-1
A table offers
a precise way to view,


184
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,827 line:-1
filter, sort, and edit our data
in an expansive UI,


185
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,696 line:-1
making good use
of screen space.


186
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,899 line:-1
Generally, if you have
visual elements to show


187
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,902 line:-1
and don't need complex sorting,
use a list.


188
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,804 line:-1
Otherwise, if you need
multiple columns,


189
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,872 line:-1
consider a table.


190
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,508 position:50%
I'm going to replace the list
with a table


191
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,411 position:50%
and provide some columns
to divide each row by.


192
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,787 position:50%
And easy as that, I have
a table with a single column!


193
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,722 line:-1
So let's add
some more columns.


194
00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:52.559 line:-1 position:50%
I want to know how long it will
take for each plant to grow,


195
00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:55.061 line:-1 position:50%
so I'm going to add
a column for that.


196
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,930 position:50%
Instead of providing a key path,


197
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,899 line:0
I'm going to open up the content
closure for the TableColumn,


198
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,669 position:50%
and it will be handed a plant.


199
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,205 line:0
Now, we can provide
any view we like here,


200
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,007 line:0
but the daysToMaturity property
is an integer,


201
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:12,779 position:50%
so we'll provide a text view
with a formatted string.


202
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,349 line:-1
I have a lot of plants,
and I'm always planting more.


203
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,017 line:-1
Being able to select
and sort the rows


204
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,488 line:-1
will help keep our plants
organized.


205
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,891 line:-1
So first we can add a binding
to the selection.


206
00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:26.793 line:-1 position:50%
When making the table
sortable,


207
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,496 line:-1
we need to make sure
we provide a sortOrder binding


208
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,165 line:-1
and a key path to each column.


209
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:37,170 line:-1
So we'll need to add a key path
to the daysToMaturity column.


210
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,038 line:-1
To really flex the power
of the table,


211
00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:41.641 line:-1 position:50%
let's paste in some more columns
from the TableColumns file


212
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.176 line:-1 position:50%
in the Views folder.


213
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,744 line:-1
They'll let us set
some key dates


214
00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.614 line:-1 position:50%
and flag a plant as a favorite.


215
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:59,192 line:-1
I'm going to switch off previews
for now and run the app.


216
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,831 line:-1
Look at all this plant data!


217
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.299 line:-1 position:50%
I can select rows,


218
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:10,236 line:-1
and I can click on
column headers to sort them.


219
00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:12.739 line:-1 position:50%
This is great, but right now
I don't have a way


220
00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:16.075 line:-1 position:50%
to perform many basic actions
needed to manage a garden,


221
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,744 line:-1
such as adding
a new plant to the table


222
00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:21.114 line:-1 position:50%
or marking multiple plants
as watered.


223
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,517 line:-1
The toolbar is a familiar place
for these kinds of actions --


224
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,953 line:-1
it's a standard location
that macOS users


225
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:30,823 line:-1
can discover ways
to use your app.


226
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,458 line:-1
We can add a toolbar here,


227
00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:35.595 line:-1 position:50%
starting with a button
to add a plant.


228
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,201 line:-1
We'll give it a label
with the title, "Add Plant"


229
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:48.074 line:-1 position:50%
and the systemImage "plus".


230
00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.542 line:-1 position:50%
I'm going to build and run,


231
00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.845 line:-1 position:50%
and now I can add a plant
to my table!


232
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,549 line:-1
Customization
over our app's interface


233
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,418 line:-1
can also be surfaced
in the toolbar,


234
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,388 line:-1
such as how we'd prefer
to view the garden.


235
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:07,393 line:-1
We can add the
DisplayModePicker here.


236
00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:10.730 line:-1 position:50%
I've got a lot of plants,
and while I can order them,


237
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.865 line:-1 position:50%
it would be great to narrow down
the number of rows


238
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,101 line:-1
quickly and precisely.


239
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,669 line:-1
We always have immediate access


240
00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:18.705 line:-1 position:50%
to a hardware keyboard
on the Mac,


241
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,873 line:-1
so I'm going to add
the searchable modifier


242
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:26,746 line:-1
to the Table, passing in
a binding to the searchText.


243
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,182 line:-1
The searchText is a property
on the detail view


244
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,984 line:-1
that we use to filter
the plants array


245
00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:33.786 line:-1 position:50%
that gets handed to the table.


246
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,690 line:-1
And that's all we need to do
to add search filtering!


247
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,592 line:-1
We've got the structure
of our window set up,


248
00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.028 line:-1 position:50%
but I'd really like to be able
to see my veggie patch


249
00:12:42.028 --> 00:12:45.131 line:-1 position:50%
and my backyard flower bed
at the same time.


250
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,234 line:-1
Well, it turns out that
we already have this ability.


251
00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:51.137 line:-1 position:50%
I can open up a new window
from the File menu,


252
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,172 line:-1
and each window
has its own selection


253
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,109 line:-1
and sidebar expansion state.


254
00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:58.611 line:-1 position:50%
Each toolbar, of course,
belongs to its own window,


255
00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:03.549 line:-1 position:50%
so I can add plants to the
veggie patch or the flower bed.


256
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,052 line:-1
My plants need watering
regularly.


257
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,388 line:-1
I'd like to be able
to sort and filter my plants,


258
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:13,493 line:-1
select some rows, and mark those
as watered all at once.


259
00:13:13.493 --> 00:13:17.397 line:-1 position:50%
We'll add commands to do these
actions to the macOS main menu.


260
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:21,134 line:-1
The menu is a familiar piece of
UI that can even be searched,


261
00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.970 line:-1 position:50%
helping people explore your app.


262
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.606 line:-1 position:50%
Before adding
our custom commands,


263
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,107 line:-1
let's begin by adding
some commands


264
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,677 line:-1
that the system provides for us.


265
00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:32.779 line:-1 position:50%
Move over to the GardenApp file.


266
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,714 position:50%
I'm going to add
the commands modifier


267
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:38,751 line:0
to the WindowGroup,
and add the SidebarCommands().


268
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,421 position:50%
Now the sidebar can be toggled
from the View menu


269
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,891 line:0
or with a keyboard shortcut.


270
00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:46.993 line:-1 position:50%
Now for our custom commands.


271
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:51,631 line:-1
Open the PlantCommands file
in the Main Menu folder.


272
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,766 line:-1
I want to be able
to send actions to the garden


273
00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:59.405 line:-1 position:50%
in the front-most window,
so I'll need a garden variable.


274
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,607 line:-1
We'll use a @FocusedBinding
property wrapper,


275
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,477 line:-1
passing in a key path
to a custom property


276
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:08,981 line:-1
that I've defined in an
extension on FocusedValues.


277
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,751 line:-1
The plant command menu
items will also need to know


278
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,586 line:-1
which plants are selected
in the table


279
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,089 line:-1
so we can check them off
as watered,


280
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:20,093 line:-1
so we'll need to pass
the selection up, too.


281
00:14:20.093 --> 00:14:22.295 line:-1 position:50%
Moving onto the body,
you'll notice that commands


282
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,031 line:-1
are declared similarly to views,
meaning you can make your own


283
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,532 line:-1
and build a custom tree
of commands


284
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,935 line:-1
to represent your menus.


285
00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:30.970 line:-1 position:50%
First up is
the add plant action.


286
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.340 line:-1 position:50%
Now, while we can already
add a plant from the toolbar,


287
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.508 line:-1 position:50%
the main menu should contain


288
00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:38.010 line:-1 position:50%
all the possible actions
your app can perform,


289
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.145 line:-1 position:50%
whereas the toolbar,


290
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,948 line:-1
normally just some subset
as a convenience.


291
00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:44.016 line:-1 position:50%
Since this is an action
to create something,


292
00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:46.285 line:-1 position:50%
we'll put it
in a familiar place.


293
00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:47.954 line:-1 position:50%
Using a CommandGroup,


294
00:14:47.954 --> 00:14:52.792 line:-1 position:50%
we'll place it before
the newItem in the File menu.


295
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,961 line:-1
For my watering action,
I want to put it in


296
00:14:54.961 --> 00:14:57.330 line:-1 position:50%
a new CommandMenu
called "Plants".


297
00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:02.335 line:-1 position:50%
This will appear next to
the View menu in our app.


298
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,674 line:-1
These views simply
contain buttons


299
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,009 line:-1
that mutate the garden,


300
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:14,180 line:-1
and modifiers to define
the button behavior.


301
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,750 line:-1
We have multiple windows,
but only ever one menu bar.


302
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.852 line:-1 position:50%
I don't want to put carrots
in my flower bed,


303
00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:21.854 line:-1 position:50%
so how can the menu
know which garden


304
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,323 line:-1
to send the action to?


305
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,892 position:50%
Back in the GardenDetail view,


306
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,861 line:0
I'll add the focusedSceneValue
modifier to the table,


307
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,365 position:50%
passing in my key path
and a binding.


308
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,634 position:50%
I'll do the same
for the selection.


309
00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:39.705 line:-1 position:50%
This tells the system
to expose these values


310
00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:44.177 line:-1 position:50%
for the given key path when
the entire scene is in focus.


311
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:47,380 position:50%
Finally, in the GardenApp file,
we need to add our new commands


312
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,049 position:50%
after the SidebarCommands()
we added earlier.


313
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:54,053 position:50%
SwiftUI will then know
to add them to the main menu.


314
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,022 line:-1
I can now insert a plant
into the garden


315
00:15:56.022 --> 00:15:59.158 line:-1 position:50%
in the front-most window
from the main menu.


316
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,028 line:-1
I can also select plants that
need to be marked as watered,


317
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,564 line:-1
and do so from the Plants menu.


318
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,837 line:-1
Adding menus
to all your app's actions


319
00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:12.505 line:-1 position:50%
increases the flexibility
of your app


320
00:16:12.505 --> 00:16:14.440 line:-1 position:50%
by enabling keyboard shortcuts


321
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,677 line:-1
and offering different ways
to get things done in your app.


322
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,946 line:-1
It also aids the discoverability
of actions,


323
00:16:19.946 --> 00:16:24.283 line:-1 position:50%
empowering people to explore and
discover your app's features.


324
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,286 position:50%
Speaking of, in part two,
you'll be adding more features


325
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,888 position:50%
and polish to your app
with Jeff,


326
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:32,291 position:50%
including an accent color,
drag and drop between tables,


327
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,627 position:50%
and how to take and attach
a photo of a plant


328
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,430 position:50%
with an iOS device.


329
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.998 line:-1 position:50%
We've covered a lot today.


330
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:41.467 line:-1 position:50%
We've built the interface
for a Mac app from the ground up


331
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,237 line:-1
using SwiftUI, and shown
how each component


332
00:16:44.237 --> 00:16:48.507 line:-1 position:50%
contributes to what can
make a great Mac app.


333
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,842 line:-1
Thanks for watching!
