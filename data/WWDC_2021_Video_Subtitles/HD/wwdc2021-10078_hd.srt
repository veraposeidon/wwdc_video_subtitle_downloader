[Jerry] Hi, everyone.
Thank you for tuning in.


4
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:12,779 line:-1
My name is Jerry,


5
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,515 line:-2
and I'm excited
to present to you


6
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,451 line:-2
how to bring Object Capture
assets into AR Quick Look.


7
00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:18.619 line:-1 align:center
As a reminder,


8
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,622 line:-2
AR Quick Look is the built-in,
system-wide AR viewer


9
00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:23.457 line:-1 align:center
for 3D models across iOS,


10
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.362 line:-2 align:center
available in Safari,
Messages, Files, and more.


11
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,898 line:-2
Apps and websites
can embed 3D models,


12
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.133 line:-2 align:center
allowing people to view
and interact with them


13
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.168 line:-1 align:center
in their own environment.


14
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.471 line:-2 align:center
This can be a great way
to showcase a product,


15
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,972 line:-1
promote an event,


16
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,609 line:-2
or provide additional content
in an immersive experience,


17
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,278 line:-1
such as this interactive demo


18
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.281 line:-2 align:center
for the Apple TV+ show
"For All Mankind"


19
00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:50.484 line:-2 align:center
where you can learn more
about a cosmonaut space suit.


20
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,556 line:-1
In this presentation,


21
00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.425 line:-2 align:center
I'll be talking about how to use
the Object Capture API


22
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:02,095 line:-2
to create 3D content
for AR Quick Look,


23
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,463 line:-2
as well as some
of the best practices


24
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,732 line:-2
to keep in mind,
depending on your use case.


25
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,735 line:-1
Then, I'll give a quick recap


26
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,204 line:-2
on how to integrate
AR Quick Look


27
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,072 line:-1
in your app or website.


28
00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.241 line:-1 align:center
And finally,


29
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,043 line:-2
I'll show some
exciting applications


30
00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.144 line:-1 align:center
that AR Quick Look


31
00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:19.313 line:-2 align:center
and Object Capture
can help create.


32
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,750 line:-2
Let's get started with
the 3D content creation process


33
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,086 line:-2
for your AR Quick Look
experience.


34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,855 line:-1
Previously,


35
00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.457 line:-2 align:center
if you wanted to create
3D content for AR Quick Look,


36
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,827 line:-2
it required the use
of a 3D-modeling software.


37
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,729 line:-2
However,
they are usually expensive


38
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,699 line:-2
and can be difficult
to approach for everyone.


39
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:39,566 line:-1
This year,


40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,735 line:-2
we've introduced
our new Object Capture API,


41
00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.136 line:-1 align:center
built into RealityKit,


42
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,974 line:-2
as an alternative way
to generate a USDZ file.


43
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,743 line:-2
It allows you to create
a high-quality 3D model


44
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,645 line:-2
by using a collection
of still images


45
00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.380 line:-1 align:center
of the real-world object.


46
00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.149 line:-2 align:center
Object Capture does
the heavy lifting


47
00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:57.718 line:-1 align:center
to create a USDZ file


48
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:01.221 line:-2 align:center
that can be viewed directly
in AR Quick Look.


49
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:02,856 line:-2
You can
also use Reality Composer


50
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,260 line:-2
if you want to add interactive
custom behaviors to your model.


51
00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.160 line:-1 align:center
For example,


52
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,428 line:-1
you can add tap triggers


53
00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:10.898 line:-2 align:center
and camera actions
to your digital scene.


54
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,502 line:-2
Together, these technologies
now make it easier than ever


55
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,939 line:-2
for anyone to create
an immersive AR experience.


56
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.909 line:-2 align:center
Let's see a demo
of this workflow in action.


57
00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:25.145 line:-2 align:center
I've just started an online shop
selling handmade pottery,


58
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,180 line:-1
and here's one of them.


59
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.517 line:-2 align:center
I'll show you how to create
a 3D model of this pot


60
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,718 line:-1
and add behaviors


61
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,154 line:-2
so that customers can preview it
on their own desk


62
00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:35.522 line:-1 align:center
with a variety of succulents


63
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,024 line:-1
before buying.


64
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:38,926 line:-2
But first,
let's see it in action.


65
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,933 line:-2
Here is the virtual succulent
placed on my desk.


66
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,301 line:-1
Let me go in for a closer look.


67
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,436 line:-2
You can see
the geometric spirals


68
00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.504 line:-1 align:center
in great detail.


69
00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:55.108 line:-2 align:center
OK, now let's preview
a few other succulents.


70
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,945 line:-1
I'll tap on the green one...


71
00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:00.180 line:-1 align:center
and it switches to the red one.


72
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,882 line:-1
Let's check out a few more.


73
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:02,916 line:-1
Now I'll tap again.


74
00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.054 line:-1 align:center
Oh, I really like this gray one!


75
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,856 line:-1
It really matches with the pot.


76
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,158 line:-2
I'm curious how it looks
compared to the real one.


77
00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.865 line:-1 align:center
Wow, that looks very convincing,


78
00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.833 line:-2 align:center
except the leaves have grown
a lot bigger


79
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,835 line:-2
since I scanned this
a few weeks ago.


80
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,371 line:-1
Now, as a friendly reminder,


81
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,640 line:-2
Object Capture does not make
your virtual plants grow


82
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,975 line:-1
automatically,


83
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:30,143 line:-2
but if you want,
you can simulate that


84
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,413 line:-2
by changing the scale
using Reality Composer.


85
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,182 line:-2
I think this would
make a wonderful asset


86
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.517 line:-1 align:center
for my online store.


87
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,720 line:-2
Now let me walk you through
how I created this from scratch.


88
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:41.588 line:-1 align:center
The first step for me


89
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,491 line:-2
was to take photos
of the succulent pot by itself,


90
00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:46.660 line:-2 align:center
from all angles,
on a neutral background.


91
00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:52.766 line:-2 align:center
I then used Object Capture
to generate a USDZ model.


92
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,801 line:-2
Similarly,
I repeated these steps


93
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,637 line:-2
for the each
of the succulent plants


94
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.407 line:-2 align:center
to generate
three separate USDZ models.


95
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,408 line:-1
Now let me show you


96
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.177 line:-2 align:center
how to swap
different succulent plants


97
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,311 line:-1
in the same pot


98
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,680 line:-2
by adding behaviors
in Reality Composer.


99
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,783 line:-1
I've already started a project


100
00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.318 line:-1 align:center
where I've added the pot base


101
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,853 line:-2
and arranged
the three succulents


102
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,355 line:-2
so it properly rests
inside the pot.


103
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,958 line:-1
Now let's add the behaviors.


104
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,194 line:-2
First, I added
a "hide on start" behavior


105
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:23,630 line:-2
so initially only
the green succulent is shown.


106
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,465 line:-2
When someone taps
on the green succulent,


107
00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.569 line:-2 align:center
we want it to swap
and show the red one.


108
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,304 line:-2
For this,
I've added a tap trigger,


109
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,841 line:-2
along with "hide"
and "show" actions.


110
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,409 line:-1
I then repeated these steps


111
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,544 line:-2
so we can swap
from the red to gray


112
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,513 line:-1
and gray to green.


113
00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:40.814 line:-1 align:center
And that's it!


114
00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:42.683 line:-2 align:center
Now we just need
to export the asset,


115
00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:44.451 line:-2 align:center
and we can view it
in AR Quick Look


116
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,286 line:-1
like we just saw earlier.


117
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,990 line:-2
Now that we've just seen
how easy it is to create content


118
00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:51.391 line:-1 align:center
using Object Capture,


119
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,126 line:-2
let's talk
about the best practices


120
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,063 line:-2
when exporting models
for viewing in AR Quick Look.


121
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,933 line:-2
When exporting a USDZ file
using Object Capture,


122
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,870 line:-2
it is important to determine
which detail setting to use.


123
00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:04.905 line:-1 align:center
Here's a table to illustrate


124
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,841 line:-2
the different characteristics
of each setting.


125
00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:09.009 line:-1 align:center
There's always a tradeoff


126
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,546 line:-2
between visual fidelity
and file size.


127
00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:15.082 line:-2 align:center
Exporting a USDZ
with a small file size


128
00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.384 line:-2 align:center
is an important consideration
for AR Quick Look


129
00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.152 line:-2 align:center
because it results
in a shorter download time


130
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,321 line:-1
for users.


131
00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:23.657 line:-2 align:center
No matter which detail setting
you choose,


132
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,927 line:-2
Object Capture will always use
the same underlying algorithms


133
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,463 line:-2
to generate
a high-quality reconstruction,


134
00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.832 line:-2 align:center
but applies varying
levels of mesh decimation


135
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,233 line:-1
and texture down-sampling,


136
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,937 line:-2
depending
on the specified detail setting.


137
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,039 line:-2
The Reduced
and Medium detail settings


138
00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:40.174 line:-1 align:center
offer a great balance


139
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:43,310 line:-2
between visual fidelity
and file size.


140
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,746 line:-2
Therefore, when creating content
for AR Quick Look,


141
00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.714 line:-2 align:center
we recommend
that you first export


142
00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:50.617 line:-2 align:center
in both Reduced
and Medium detail settings.


143
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:52.252 line:-2 align:center
Then you can choose
which to keep


144
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,688 line:-2
after evaluating
both the visual differences


145
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:56.523 line:-2 align:center
and other important
considerations,


146
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,625 line:-1
which I will talk about next.


147
00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:59.760 line:-1 align:center
As we've just seen,


148
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,962 line:-2
the Reduced detail setting
will generate models


149
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,830 line:-1
with the smallest file size.


150
00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.099 line:-2 align:center
This makes it ideal
for web distribution,


151
00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:10.070 line:-2 align:center
as it reduces the download time
before your model can be viewed.


152
00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.805 line:-2 align:center
This is also
the recommended setting


153
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,607 line:-2
if you plan
on combining multiple assets


154
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,908 line:-1
in a single scene,


155
00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:18.312 line:-2 align:center
perhaps to showcase
a collection of succulents.


156
00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:20.614 line:-2 align:center
These attributes make
the Reduced detail setting


157
00:06:20.647 --> 00:06:23.283 line:-2 align:center
a great choice
for a majority of use cases.


158
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,587 line:-1
In certain situations


159
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,255 line:-2
where you notice
a significant difference


160
00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:29.323 line:-1 align:center
in visual quality


161
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,692 line:-2
between the Reduced
and Medium settings,


162
00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:35.128 line:-2 align:center
it may be more suitable
to use the Medium detail.


163
00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:38.131 line:-2 align:center
This is usually the case when
you have a very complex object,


164
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,567 line:-2
and would require you
to take hundreds of images


165
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,570 line:-2
for reconstructing it
using Object Capture.


166
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:44,938 line:-1
Keep in mind, however,


167
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:48,041 line:-2
that this will generate
a USDZ with a larger file size,


168
00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:52.112 line:-2 align:center
so it's best not to combine
multiple models together.


169
00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:53.080 line:-1 align:center
For example,


170
00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:54.314 line:-1 align:center
here I've taken photos


171
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:57,851 line:-2
of the succulent
and pot base together.


172
00:06:57.885 --> 00:06:58.952 line:-1 align:center
Similarly,


173
00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.555 line:-2 align:center
the Medium detail setting
is more suitable for apps


174
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,491 line:-2
where there is already a local
copy of the asset on the device,


175
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,727 line:-1
which eliminates download times.


176
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.761 line:-1 align:center
In summary,


177
00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:10.163 line:-2 align:center
we recommend you evaluate
both detail settings


178
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:14,334 line:-2
and base your decision depending
on your object and use case.


179
00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:17.304 line:-2 align:center
Be sure to test your asset
on a variety of iOS hardware


180
00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:20.107 line:-2 align:center
to ensure device compatibility
and performance.


181
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,708 line:-1
With either detail setting,


182
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,178 line:-2
it's best to ensure quality
at the source.


183
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,979 line:-1
So always take sharp images


184
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,181 line:-1
and avoid motion blur


185
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:30,384 line:-2
to generate a good,
quality reconstruction.


186
00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:33.086 line:-2 align:center
Also, make sure to provide
sufficient overlap


187
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,023 line:-2
of at least 70%
between adjacent photos


188
00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:38.825 line:-2 align:center
and fill the frame
with the object.


189
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:39,826 line:-1
For more details,


190
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,128 line:-1
I encourage you to read


191
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,096 line:-2
the "Capturing Photographs"
article


192
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,432 line:-2
and check out
the "Object Capture" session.


193
00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:48.135 line:-2 align:center
Now that you know
the best practices,


194
00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:50.704 line:-2 align:center
let's recap how to integrate
AR Quick Look.


195
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,140 line:-2
As you know, it's possible
to embed AR Quick Look


196
00:07:53.173 --> 00:07:56.476 line:-2 align:center
in your app or website
with just a few lines of code.


197
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,612 line:-2
Let's go over a quick recap
of the integration.


198
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,083 line:-2
If you are embedding
AR Quick Look in an app,


199
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,319 line:-2
you can use
the Quick Look framework.


200
00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:07.754 line:-2 align:center
Here we create a new
QLPreviewController


201
00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:10.557 line:-2 align:center
and assign "self"
as its dataSource.


202
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:12.926 line:-2 align:center
Then we present it
like a regular view controller.


203
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,196 line:-2
Of course,
we also have to implement


204
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,866 line:-2
the QLPreviewController
dataSource protocol,


205
00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.335 line:-2 align:center
which tells Quick Look
how many previews to show


206
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,903 line:-1
and what each is going to be.


207
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,240 line:-2
Here we create
an ARQL previewItem


208
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,376 line:-2
with the URL
to a local file on disk.


209
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,344 line:-1
Then we return it


210
00:08:30.377 --> 00:08:32.813 line:-2 align:center
so the system knows
to present AR Quick Look.


211
00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:37.551 line:-2 align:center
We also provide ways
to customize the experience,


212
00:08:37.584 --> 00:08:40.420 line:-2 align:center
such as disabling
content scaling in AR mode


213
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:43,156 line:-2
so that people can always see
the object at its true scale


214
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,492 line:-1
when placed into the world.


215
00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:46.894 line:-1 align:center
To disable scaling,


216
00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:49.596 line:-2 align:center
set the allowsContentScaling
property to be "false."


217
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,667 line:-2
If you are integrating
the AR Quick Look experience


218
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,935 line:-1
on your website,


219
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,838 line:-2
you can add this a-tag snippet
to your HTML,


220
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.907 line:-2 align:center
replacing the URL
to your own model


221
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.275 line:-1 align:center
and image thumbnail.


222
00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:05.812 line:-2 align:center
And be sure to include
the rel="ar" attribute.


223
00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:09.650 line:-2 align:center
This will add the AR badge icon
to the thumbnail.


224
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:10,617 line:-1
Similarly,


225
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:13.220 line:-2 align:center
it's possible to disable
content scaling in AR


226
00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:15.489 line:-1 align:center
when embedded on web pages too.


227
00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:17.157 line:-1 align:center
To disable content scaling,


228
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:19.393 line:-2 align:center
set allowsContentScaling
to be 0.


229
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.396 line:-1 align:center
When embedded on websites,


230
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,131 line:-1
you can also surface Apple Pay


231
00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:26.300 line:-2 align:center
and custom actions,
like preorder,


232
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,701 line:-1
directly in AR Quick Look


233
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.570 line:-2 align:center
to allow customers
to take the next step


234
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,771 line:-1
in your order flow.


235
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:33,273 line:-1
So that's a quick summary


236
00:09:33.307 --> 00:09:36.243 line:-2 align:center
of just some of the things
you can do with AR Quick Look.


237
00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:37.177 line:-1 align:center
For more details,


238
00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:39.713 line:-2 align:center
I encourage you to check out
our previous sessions.


239
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:43.650 line:-2 align:center
Now let's talk about
some real-world applications


240
00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:44.952 line:-1 align:center
with AR Quick Look.


241
00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:47.254 line:-2 align:center
With the announcement
of Object Capture,


242
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,922 line:-2
we've now made
the entire process


243
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,491 line:-2
of creating
and distributing 3D content


244
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,094 line:-2
much more accessible
for everyone.


245
00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:55.829 line:-2 align:center
Object Capture
does the heavy lifting


246
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,599 line:-1
of generating a USDZ file.


247
00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:02.135 line:-2 align:center
Reality Composer makes it easy
to create multi-asset scenes


248
00:10:02.169 --> 00:10:05.305 line:-1 align:center
and add interactivity to models.


249
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,674 line:-2
AR Quick Look provides
a great viewing experience


250
00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:11.845 line:-2 align:center
for apps and websites on iOS
and is also available on macOS.


251
00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:13.981 line:-1 align:center
Together,


252
00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:15.849 line:-2 align:center
these technologies allow
for the creation


253
00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:18.051 line:-2 align:center
of both improved
and new experiences


254
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,953 line:-1
in a variety of fields.


255
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:23,590 line:-2
Let's take a look at some
examples for inspiration.


256
00:10:23.624 --> 00:10:25.993 line:-2 align:center
E-commerce is one
of the most popular use cases


257
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,862 line:-2
for AR Quick Look,
and for good reason.


258
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:30,931 line:-2
Viewing 3D models
with AR Quick Look


259
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,034 line:-2
helps customers visualize
products in their own space,


260
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:38,005 line:-2
whether it's shoes,
photo frames, or furniture.


261
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,273 line:-1
Now, with Object Capture,


262
00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:42.276 line:-2 align:center
you, as a retailer,
can easily create 3D models


263
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,210 line:-1
of your product


264
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:46,180 line:-2
without needing to have
prior 3D experience,


265
00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:48.549 line:-2 align:center
like this Fragment Design x
Air Jordan 3 sneaker


266
00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:50.617 line:-2 align:center
that the team behind GOAT app
has created


267
00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:53.253 line:-1 align:center
using Object Capture.


268
00:10:53.287 --> 00:10:55.923 line:-2 align:center
You can also take advantage
of Reality Composer


269
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:59,326 line:-2
to add additional behaviors to
enhance the viewing experience.


270
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,762 line:-2
For example,
similar to the succulent demo,


271
00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:04.298 line:-2 align:center
where I can swap between
different succulent plants,


272
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,366 line:-2
you can make an app
that allows customers


273
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.702 line:-2 align:center
to preview
different outfits or purses.


274
00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:13.273 line:-1 align:center
Another use case is for museums.


275
00:11:13.307 --> 00:11:16.577 line:-2 align:center
Historical artifacts are often
stored in protective cases,


276
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.546 line:-2 align:center
making it difficult
to view from all angles.


277
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,349 line:-2
However,
by capturing the object in 3D,


278
00:11:22.382 --> 00:11:23.917 line:-1 align:center
viewers can see and interact


279
00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:26.520 line:-2 align:center
with a detailed virtual
representation of the artifact


280
00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:28.755 line:-1 align:center
on their own device.


281
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,290 line:-1
Not only does AR Quick Look


282
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,259 line:-2
allow you to tour museums
remotely,


283
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,362 line:-2
but it can also enable
new forms of in-person exhibits


284
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,532 line:-2
that can only be experienced
in a virtual world.


285
00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:43.337 line:-2 align:center
You can also add voiceover audio
to explain the 3D content


286
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.739 line:-2 align:center
or help people
who are hard of seeing,


287
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,809 line:-2
like this Zemi figure from
the Metropolitan Museum of Art.


288
00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:51.278 line:-1 align:center
Let's have a listen.


289
00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:53.480 line:-2 align:center
[voiceover] It was made
around 1000 AD


290
00:11:53.514 --> 00:11:55.449 line:-2 align:center
by a sculptor
of the Taino civilizations


291
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,585 line:-2
of the Antilles archipelago
in the Caribbean Sea,


292
00:11:58.619 --> 00:12:01.188 line:-2 align:center
probably in what is now
the Dominican Republic.


293
00:12:03.123 --> 00:12:04.424 line:-1 align:center
[Jerry] Another great use case


294
00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:06.460 line:-2 align:center
of Object Capture
and AR Quick Look


295
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,662 line:-1
is in the field of education.


296
00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:11.632 line:-2 align:center
Diagrams and videos have
historically been 2D,


297
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,066 line:-2
which can sometimes
make it challenging


298
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.868 line:-1 align:center
to convey 3D concepts.


299
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:19,606 line:-2
Now, with augmented reality,
we can teach in, well, 3D.


300
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.842 line:-2 align:center
Teachers can now create
engaging lessons


301
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:26,013 line:-2
by leveraging 3D models
generated with Object Capture.


302
00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:28.482 line:-2 align:center
And technology can provide
immediate feedback


303
00:12:28.515 --> 00:12:29.716 line:-1 align:center
and interactivity


304
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.086 line:-2 align:center
so students can learn
and discover at their own pace.


305
00:12:33.687 --> 00:12:36.523 line:-2 align:center
This doesn't just help teachers
with lesson planning.


306
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:39,493 line:-2
Kids can also express
their creativity in AR.


307
00:12:39.526 --> 00:12:40.360 line:-1 align:center
For example,


308
00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:43.497 line:-2 align:center
the Qlone app allows kids
to create 3D models


309
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,200 line:-2
of their favorite toy
or art project.


310
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,235 line:-2
It provides
a convenient visual guide


311
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,171 line:-2
and automatically
takes pictures as appropriate


312
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:55,142 line:-2
so kids can scan
objects by themselves.


313
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,010 line:-2
Qlone is working
on incorporating


314
00:12:57.044 --> 00:12:59.813 line:-2 align:center
the Object Capture technology
with seamless integration


315
00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:01.915 line:-1 align:center
between their iOS and Mac apps,


316
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:04.418 line:-2 align:center
making it easier for kids
to share their creations


317
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,720 line:-1
with friends and family.


318
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,922 line:-2
I've invited the kids
of our Apple colleagues


319
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,191 line:-2
to share some of the work
that they've done.


320
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,894 line:-2
After capturing photos
and generating 3D models


321
00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:15.229 line:-1 align:center
with Object Capture,


322
00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:17.264 line:-2 align:center
the kids then added
digital interactions


323
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,966 line:-1
using Reality Composer.


324
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:19,967 line:-1
Let's check it out.


325
00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:24.605 line:-2 align:center
The first is a dinosaur costume

00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:45,759 line:-1
As you've just seen,


334
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:49,763 line:-2
anyone can now develop immersive
AR experiences from scratch


335
00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:52.099 line:-2 align:center
using a combination
of Object Capture,


336
00:13:52.132 --> 00:13:55.536 line:-2 align:center
Reality Composer,
and AR Quick Look.


337
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,838 line:-2
Object Capture creates
high-quality assets


338
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:01,041 line:-2
that are ready to be viewed
in AR Quick Look.


339
00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:02.442 line:-1 align:center
Reality Composer makes it easy


340
00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:04.978 line:-2 align:center
to combine multiple assets
into a single scene


341
00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:07.147 line:-1 align:center
and add interactivity to models.


342
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,716 line:-1
