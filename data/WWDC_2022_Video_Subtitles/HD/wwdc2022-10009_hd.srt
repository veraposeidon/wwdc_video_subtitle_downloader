Hi, welcome to
our session on iPad App design.


5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,946 line:-1
I'm Bryant Jow.


6
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,147 line:-1
And I'm Grant Paul,


7
00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.250 line:-1 position:50%
and we're from
the Apple Design Team.


8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,318 line:-1
Bryant: Today, we'll show you
some of the new UIKit


9
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,520 line:-1
and SwiftUI updates
in iPadOS 16,


10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,655 line:-1
as well as some general tips


11
00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.958 line:-1 position:50%
for incorporating these
into your app designs.


12
00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.426 line:-1 position:50%
With iPadOS 16,


13
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,862 line:-1
people can take advantage
of larger resolutions


14
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,832 line:-1
with extended display support
and display zoom


15
00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.367 line:-1 position:50%
and work with their apps
in a single view


16
00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.569 line:-1 position:50%
by using Stage Manager.


17
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,372 line:-1
So what does this mean
for iPad apps?


18
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,674 line:-1
Your app design should always
embrace larger screens


19
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,075 line:-1
and different window sizes,


20
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,545 line:-1
as well as support all
the different inputs of iPadOS.


21
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,614 line:-1
And now, your iPad apps
should consider


22
00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.283 line:-1 position:50%
how to lean into
more advanced use cases


23
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,319 line:-1
that come with using iPad
like a desktop.


24
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,788 line:-1
So that's why we're introducing
a number of improvements


25
00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:58.358 line:-1 position:50%
to help apps become
more powerful and easier to use.


26
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,528 line:-1
Here's a preview
of the features we'll cover:


27
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,064 line:-1
toolbars and customization,


28
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,700 line:-1
document menu,


29
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,635 line:-1
editing menus,


30
00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.604 line:-1 position:50%
find and replace,


31
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,239 line:-1
navigation,


32
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:13.807 line:-1 position:50%
search,


33
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,542 line:-1
tables,


34
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,878 line:-1
and selection.


35
00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.446 line:-1 position:50%
Today, we're going
to show examples


36
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,281 line:-1
of how you can
incorporate these updates


37
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,251 line:-1
in designing two kinds
of experiences:


38
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,055 line:-1
document editing
and content browsing.


39
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,957 line:-1
We'll start with
document editing


40
00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:31.725 line:-1 position:50%
and look at how these
improvements can help people


41
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,361 line:-1
be more productive
when using your app.


42
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,330 line:-1
Let's jump into toolbars.


43
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,999 line:-1
Toolbars are a really important
component in app design


44
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,168 line:-1
because they organize
your app's functionality,


45
00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:42.469 line:-1 position:50%
and this impacts how easy it is


46
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,038 line:-1
for people to go about
their workflows.


47
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:49,309 line:-1
Here's the previous toolbar
in the Pages app in iPadOS 15.


48
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,646 line:-1
In iPadOS 16, we're introducing
a new toolbar layout


49
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,681 line:-1
that aligns titles
to the left side


50
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,018 line:-1
and allows apps to offer more
toolbar items in the center.


51
00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.554 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a closer look.


52
00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:02.756 line:-1 position:50%
Here's the leading section
of the toolbar.


53
00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:05.292 line:-1 position:50%
It should contain items
that help people navigate within


54
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:06.693 line:-1 position:50%
and outside of the document,


55
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,962 line:-1
like the back and sidebar
buttons.


56
00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.231 line:-1 position:50%
And it displays the new
document title and menu,


57
00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:13.600 line:-1 position:50%
which I'll come back to later.


58
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.302 line:-1 position:50%
With more space in the toolbar,


59
00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:18.305 line:-1 position:50%
apps can elevate commonly used
actions in the center.


60
00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:19.673 line:-1 position:50%
In iPadOS 16,


61
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:22,709 line:-1
the Pages app shows actions
for inserting content.


62
00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.377 line:-1 position:50%
You should consider


63
00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:25.412 line:-1 position:50%
what are the most common
workflows in your app


64
00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:27.848 line:-1 position:50%
where people could benefit
from one-tap access.


65
00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:30.117 line:-1 position:50%
But be careful not
to pack your app's toolbar


66
00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:31.918 line:-1 position:50%
with too many items.


67
00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.720 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at a couple more
tools to consider


68
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.223 line:-1 position:50%
if your app
has a lot of functionality.


69
00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:39.826 line:-1 position:50%
In iPadOS 16, you can
enable customizable toolbars


70
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,028 line:-1
so people can curate the items


71
00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:43.230 line:-1 position:50%
that are most important
for their workflow.


72
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.032 line:-1 position:50%
If your app has
a lot of toolbar items


73
00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:47.534 line:-1 position:50%
or advanced features
that not all people need,


74
00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:50.103 line:-1 position:50%
you should consider
enabling customization.


75
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,838 line:-1
Note how items
in the center section


76
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,342 line:-1
can be added, removed,
or rearranged.


77
00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.944 line:-1 position:50%
Items outside of this section
are not customizable


78
00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:00.147 line:-1 position:50%
because these may include
navigation buttons


79
00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:04.985 line:-1 position:50%
or important features that need
to be always accessible.


80
00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:08.188 line:-1 position:50%
Toolbar items can also be
grouped or collapsed.


81
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.223 line:-1 position:50%
Use groups
to keep related actions together


82
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,026 line:-1
in the toolbar
or the overflow menu.


83
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,728 line:-1
In the Pages app,
similar actions


84
00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:18.598 line:-1 position:50%
like inserting tables, charts,
shapes, and photos


85
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,734 line:-1
are grouped together.


86
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,869 line:-1
When there's not enough room
in the toolbar,


87
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.238 line:-1 position:50%
these actions collapse
into a plus button.


88
00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.706 line:-1 position:50%
You can also
make wide toolbar items


89
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,877 line:-1
collapse into a compact glyph
at smaller window sizes.


90
00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:35.816 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let's take a look at the
trailing section of the toolbar.


91
00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:38.385 line:-1 position:50%
This section may contain
a variety of items:


92
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,987 line:-1
any button that invokes
nearby inspectors,


93
00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:43.990 line:-1 position:50%
important items that should stay
visible at any window size,


94
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.792 line:-1 position:50%
and an optional overflow button


95
00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:47.527 line:-1 position:50%
for people to access
hidden items


96
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,497 line:-1
as well as toolbar
customization.


97
00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:52.532 line:-1 position:50%
When people resize your app,


98
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,068 line:-1
the toolbar items in the center
will automatically hide


99
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,737 line:-1
into an overflow menu
when there's not enough room.


100
00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.840 line:-1 position:50%
And when the window
is resized even smaller,


101
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.076 line:-1 position:50%
only the leading and trailing
sections remain.


102
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,945 line:-1
So make sure to arrange
important items


103
00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:07.314 line:-1 position:50%
in the trailing section
if you want them to be visible


104
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,916 line:-1
at most window sizes.


105
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,119 line:-1
So here's a quick recap
of toolbars.


106
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,587 line:-1
Consider if there are
common workflows


107
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,289 line:-1
that you can elevate
in the toolbar.


108
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,025 line:-1
Arrange important toolbar items
in the trailing section


109
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,295 line:-1
to avoid overflow
in smaller window sizes.


110
00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:25.265 line:-1 position:50%
Enable customization if your app
has many toolbar items


111
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,234 line:-1
and advanced use cases.


112
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,002 line:-1
And wherever possible,


113
00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:32.772 line:-1 position:50%
try to organize similar items
into groups.


114
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,641 line:-1
Now let's take a look
at the new document menu


115
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,376 line:-1
that we mentioned earlier.


116
00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:39.279 line:-1 position:50%
To make it easier for people
to find document-related actions


117
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,214 line:-1
in one place across apps,


118
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,451 line:-1
we're introducing a new title
and menu in the toolbar.


119
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,554 line:-1
This layout is intended for
document viewers like Quick Look


120
00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:50.323 line:-1 position:50%
or document-editing apps
like Keynote.


121
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,659 line:-1
Note, these apps may also
have a browser view,


122
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,060 line:-1
which can appear
as a back button


123
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.962 line:-1 position:50%
near the document title.


124
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,330 line:-1
If your app is primarily used


125
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.633 line:-1 position:50%
for editing or viewing
documents,


126
00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.801 line:-1 position:50%
you should consider
using this new menu.


127
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,637 line:-1
Let's open Keynote's
document menu


128
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,372 line:-1
by clicking the title.


129
00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:07.474 line:-1 position:50%
Here, you can see
there is a combined set


130
00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:11.845 line:-1 position:50%
of standard document actions
as well as app-specific ones.


131
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,947 line:-1
So, what should go inside here?


132
00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:15.749 line:-1 position:50%
The menu should contain actions


133
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:19,085 line:-1
that affect the document
as a whole.


134
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,254 line:-1
Here are some examples
of standard actions


135
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,490 line:-1
that should go inside
the document menu:


136
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,528 line:-1
Duplicate, Rename, Move,
Export, and Print.


137
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,565 line:-1
You can also add custom actions
for your app.


138
00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:34.701 line:-1 position:50%
But not everything should go
inside in the document menu.


139
00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:37.170 line:-1 position:50%
Actions that take content
outside of your app


140
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.972 line:-1 position:50%
should be placed under Share,


141
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:42,509 position:50%
and actions that directly affect
content inside a document


142
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,444 line:0
should support
toolbar customization


143
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:48,682 position:50%
and appear in edit menus
where appropriate.


144
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,084 line:-1
Next, I want to talk about
a couple of features


145
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,187 line:-1
that can help users work more
efficiently in your iPad app.


146
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,723 line:-1
Let's look at edit menus.


147
00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.858 line:-1 position:50%
These menus may appear
over selected text


148
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,861 line:-1
and contain edit options
such as Copy and Paste.


149
00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:05.131 line:-1 position:50%
In iPadOS 16,
edit menus have a new look


150
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,301 line:-1
and are optimized
for touch and pointer.


151
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:11.037 line:-1 position:50%
When using touch,
the menu appears horizontally


152
00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.006 line:-1 position:50%
and people can now scroll
back and forth


153
00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:16.276 line:-1 position:50%
between the list of options
like this.


154
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:18,178 line:-1
When using pointer,
the edit menu


155
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,146 line:-1
shows a more comprehensive
list of options


156
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,182 line:-1
in a vertical layout like this.


157
00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:23.683 line:-1 position:50%
Your app should support
both styles


158
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,053 line:-1
for touch and pointer
interactions.


159
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,156 line:-1
When you incorporate
these edit menus into your app,


160
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,326 line:-1
here are a couple of things
to remember.


161
00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.128 line:-1 position:50%
Don't remove
the standard actions


162
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,097 line:-1
like Cut, Copy, and Paste.


163
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,799 line:-1
These editing tools are
important to many workflows


164
00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:42.068 line:-1 position:50%
and should be always available.


165
00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.937 line:-1 position:50%
And you should organize
custom actions


166
00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:46.406 line:-1 position:50%
close to related system actions.


167
00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.509 line:-1 position:50%
In iPadOS 16, the Notes app
groups formatting options


168
00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:53.546 line:-1 position:50%
for checklists and text
in the same section.


169
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,383 line:-1
Edit menus are not just limited
to text fields.


170
00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:59.419 line:-1 position:50%
They can also apply to objects
on a document canvas.


171
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:04.491 line:-1 position:50%
Here's an example of selecting
layers in Keynote with touch.


172
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,627 line:-1
And that same menu
when using pointer.


173
00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:10.630 line:-1 position:50%
Try to integrate these menus
into any editable content


174
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,068 line:-1
so that people can be more
productive when using your app.


175
00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:16.603 line:-1 position:50%
So that's edit menus.


176
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,040 line:-1
Now, let's dive into
find and replace.


177
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,742 line:-1
In iPadOS 16, we're introducing
find and replace


178
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,211 line:-1
into the system keyboard
so people can quickly search


179
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:30,216 line:-1
for specific words, phrases,
and more within a document.


180
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,085 line:-1
This also supports
advanced use cases


181
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,587 line:-1
like matching specific parts
of a phrase


182
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:38,091 line:-1
or replacing all matches
with a different word.


183
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,827 line:-1
And when iPad is attached
to a hardware keyboard,


184
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,096 line:-1
the find and replace interface
sits above the app


185
00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:46.833 line:-1 position:50%
in this compact appearance.


186
00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.069 line:-1 position:50%
To make find and replace
easy to access,


187
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,771 line:-1
consider adding an item
inside the overflow menu


188
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:55.141 line:-1 position:50%
as well as the system keyboard
shortcuts.


189
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.543 line:-1 position:50%
So those are some
of the new features


190
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,878 line:-1
we're introducing
for document editing.


191
00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:00.513 line:-1 position:50%
Now I'm going to hand it off
to Grant Paul,


192
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,549 line:-1
who will talk about
some more improvements.


193
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,185 line:-1
Grant: Thanks, Bryant.
Next up, I'm going to talk about


194
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,554 line:-1
improvements
for content browsing,


195
00:08:07.554 --> 00:08:11.024 line:-1 position:50%
something that you do
in a lot of different iPad apps.


196
00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:14.427 line:-1 position:50%
Content browsing experiences
are everywhere on iPad,


197
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,230 line:-1
whether you're managing
in your photo library in Photos,


198
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.900 line:-1 position:50%
browsing Apple Music,
or choosing a document in Pages.


199
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.636 line:-1 position:50%
iPadOS 16 has
some great new features


200
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,606 line:-1
and patterns
for content browsing.


201
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,975 line:-1
I'm going to focus
on three areas


202
00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:31.778 line:-1 position:50%
that are important
to this part of an app.


203
00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:36.182 line:-1 position:50%
The first one is some updates
to app navigation.


204
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,819 line:-1
iPadOS 16 has
a new style of navigation


205
00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:43.256 line:-1 position:50%
that we call "browser-style"
navigation.


206
00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:47.527 line:-1 position:50%
For example, the Files app
uses back and forward buttons


207
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,729 line:-1
to let you easily
browse between folders


208
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,967 line:-1
that might have come from
different places in the sidebar.


209
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,169 line:-1
With browser-style navigation,


210
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,838 line:-1
it's up to your app
to choose the buttons


211
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,941 line:-1
that go to the left
of the title.


212
00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:05.545 line:-1 position:50%
You should make sure to keep to
just those navigational buttons


213
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,883 line:-1
like back and forward,
or maybe a sidebar button.


214
00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.419 line:-1 position:50%
Browser-style navigation
works well


215
00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:15.622 line:-1 position:50%
when your app
has a complex hierarchy


216
00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:19.025 line:-1 position:50%
where people are often jumping
between different levels;


217
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:23,096 line:-1
things like a file browser
or a web browser.


218
00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:27.534 line:-1 position:50%
If your app has a shallow
or flat hierarchy, like Photos,


219
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,370 line:-1
you might not need
browser-style navigation


220
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,340 line:-1
because all of the destinations
in the app are already available


221
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.011 line:-1 position:50%
with a single tap
in the sidebar.


222
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:41.181 line:-1 position:50%
If you do use browser-style
navigation,


223
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:45,285 line:-1
it goes great with another
new feature in iPadOS 16:


224
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:50,390 line:-1
putting search in the top right
of the navigation bar.


225
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,893 line:-1
Search in the top right
is great when your search bar


226
00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:57.363 line:-1 position:50%
is used to filter the content
that you're looking at below


227
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,599 line:-1
on the same screen.


228
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,235 line:-1
And even though
it's in the navigation bar,


229
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,571 line:-1
it supports suggestions.


230
00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:09.642 line:-1 position:50%
Suggestions show up right off
the field as you're typing.


231
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,512 line:-1
Your app can suggest
recent searches.


232
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,647 line:-1
It can also suggest
recommendations


233
00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:16.516 line:-1 position:50%
for what to search for.


234
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:21,354 line:-1
And it can suggest filters
to narrow down your search.


235
00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:24.324 line:-1 position:50%
Again, search in the top right
is meant for searching


236
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,393 line:-1
the content
that's showing below.


237
00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:30.096 line:-1 position:50%
If you want to search
your entire app at once,


238
00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:32.432 line:-1 position:50%
it's better to keep that
in a search tab


239
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,400 line:-1
so that people can get to search


240
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.671 line:-1 position:50%
from wherever they are
in your app.


241
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:41.007 line:-1 position:50%
That's what's new
for navigation.


242
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:45,078 line:-1
Next up, I want to talk about
selection and menus.


243
00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:48.681 line:-1 position:50%
iPadOS 15 introduced
band selection,


244
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:54,254 line:-1
using the pointer to quickly
select multiple notes at once.


245
00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:57.857 line:-1 position:50%
But you still have to use the
toolbar to act on the selection


246
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,728 line:-1
and to leave edit mode
when you're done.


247
00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:05.532 line:-1 position:50%
iPadOS 16 makes that
much easier.


248
00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.233 line:-1 position:50%
If you use band selection,


249
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:12,005 line:-1
iPadOS no longer enters
editing mode automatically.


250
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,173 position:50%
You can now use
keyboard modifiers


251
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:18,011 line:0
like Command and Shift
to select and deselect,


252
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,180 position:50%
also without going into
editing mode.


253
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.683 line:-1 position:50%
And once you have
the notes selected,


254
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:29,956 line:-1
it's just a secondary click
to act on all of them together.


255
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:33,893 line:-1
With touch, you can long press
to get a context menu


256
00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:36.663 line:-1 position:50%
for those same actions.


257
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:42,135 line:-1
And these interactions
work just as well with a list.


258
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,371 position:50%
You can hold Command
to select multiple notes,


259
00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:48.174 line:-1 position:50%
use drag-and-drop
to move them into a folder,


260
00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:49.842 line:-1 position:50%
and bring up a context menu


261
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,246 line:-1
to act on multiple notes
together.


262
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:56,149 line:-1
Along with these
multi-item context menus,


263
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:01,287 line:-1
iPadOS 16 also supports
context menus in empty areas,


264
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,257 line:-1
which you can use
to create something new.


265
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:08,428 line:-1
For example, you can make
a new folder in Files.


266
00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:15.001 line:-1 position:50%
Or, you can paste
a copied event in Calendar.


267
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:18,805 line:-1
OK. That's a lot of things
to keep in mind for selection.


268
00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:21.741 line:-1 position:50%
Let's go through the checklist.


269
00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.243 line:-1 position:50%
Your app should support
keyboard focus


270
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,948 line:-1
to navigate around using
the arrow keys and with tab.


271
00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:32.018 line:-1 position:50%
Support band selection
to quickly select


272
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:36,022 line:-1
multiple items in a grid
by using the pointer.


273
00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:40.026 line:-1 position:50%
Allow multiple selection
without entering editing mode


274
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:43,396 line:-1
when using the pointer
or the keyboard.


275
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,765 line:-1
Add context menus to act


276
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,435 line:-1
on multiple selected items
together.


277
00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.070 line:-1 position:50%
And in the empty area,


278
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,841 line:-1
use a context menu
to create new items.


279
00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:58.678 line:-1 position:50%
The next thing I want
to talk about is submenus.


280
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:02,215 line:-1
On iPhone,
submenus open vertically.


281
00:13:02.215 --> 00:13:05.485 line:-1 position:50%
Since space is limited
and they're an extra tap away,


282
00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:07.720 line:-1 position:50%
it's best to use submenus
on iPhone


283
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.024 line:-1 position:50%
only when you really need one.


284
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,860 line:-1
But on iPadOS 16,


285
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.764 line:-1 position:50%
submenus open horizontally
when they have space available.


286
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:22,402 line:-1
This makes them much faster,
especially with a pointer.


287
00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:25.571 line:-1 position:50%
For example,
Calendar uses a submenu


288
00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:30.209 line:-1 position:50%
to really quickly move an event
into a different calendar.


289
00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:34.213 line:-1 position:50%
And Reminders uses submenus
to quickly change the due date


290
00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:36.783 line:-1 position:50%
and the priority.


291
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,985 line:-1
So on iPad,
you should consider


292
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,555 line:-1
including submenus
in your app's context menus


293
00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:46.693 line:-1 position:50%
to make quick changes
just like these.


294
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:51,531 line:-1
Along with submenus, iPadOS 16
also adds a new control


295
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,434 line:-1
for pop-up buttons in lists.


296
00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:57.070 line:-1 position:50%
Just like any other
pop-up button,


297
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,039 line:-1
these show a menu
to let you choose an option.


298
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,775 line:-1
Let's look at these in practice.


299
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,545 line:-1
In the past,
editing a reminder's priority


300
00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:07.980 line:-1 position:50%
meant pushing
into the detail view,


301
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,016 line:-1
then popping back out.


302
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:15,088 line:-1
It's a bunch of taps, and it
also took you out of context.


303
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:19,892 line:-1
In iPadOS 16, you change
the priority right in place.


304
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,863 line:-1
It's much faster, and you stay
right where you are.


305
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,231 line:-1
So as you've seen here,


306
00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:28.101 line:-1 position:50%
the main use for these
pop-up buttons in lists


307
00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:34.207 line:-1 position:50%
is to replace navigation pushes
in popovers and in modals.


308
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,342 line:-1
When you're using
a pop-up button,


309
00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:37.477 line:-1 position:50%
choose places where you have


310
00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:40.880 line:-1 position:50%
a well-defined set of options
to pick from.


311
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,683 line:-1
Make sure to only
use a pop-up button


312
00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:47.887 line:-1 position:50%
if your options really do
fit nicely into a menu.


313
00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:51.390 line:-1 position:50%
If your option is better
as a switch, use a switch.


314
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,793 line:-1
And if the options
really need more controls,


315
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,162 line:-1
don't try and force it.


316
00:14:56.162 --> 00:14:58.898 line:-1 position:50%
But if you only sometimes
need more controls,


317
00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:03.402 line:-1 position:50%
a good choice can be to add
a Custom option into the menu.


318
00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:05.471 line:-1 position:50%
When someone chooses Custom,


319
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,940 line:-1
your app can reveal
the extra controls


320
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.345 line:-1 position:50%
without getting in the way
of the other choices.


321
00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:14.947 line:-1 position:50%
And if your options
need an explanation,


322
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:19,452 line:-1
you can put that underneath
the pop-up button in the list.


323
00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:22.688 line:-1 position:50%
All right. That's what's new
for selection and menus.


324
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,625 line:-1
Lastly, I want to talk about
tables.


325
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:29,295 line:-1
Tables are a great new component
in iPadOS 16


326
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,598 line:-1
to make your lists of content
more powerful.


327
00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:36.435 line:-1 position:50%
Now, in the past, you may have
used a control called a table.


328
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,070 line:-1
But that wasn't quite right;


329
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:42.074 line:-1 position:50%
it's not much of a table
if it only has a single column.


330
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,378 line:-1
iPadOS 16 has a real table.


331
00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:49.682 line:-1 position:50%
Tables in SwiftUI show
multiple columns of information.


332
00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:53.886 line:-1 position:50%
And they let you sort
just by tapping a header.


333
00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:57.156 line:-1 position:50%
Now, since iPad screens
are relatively small,


334
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:01,294 line:-1
you'll only be able to show
the most important columns.


335
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,162 line:-1
But you can swap
those columns out,


336
00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:05.331 line:-1 position:50%
like replacing Size with Kind,


337
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,135 line:-1
just by choosing
a different sort option.


338
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.204 line:-1 position:50%
And as makes sense
for something that's all about


339
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:14,273 line:-1
having powerful access
to your content,


340
00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:17.577 line:-1 position:50%
sortable tables also support
all of the selection features


341
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:21,347 line:-1
I talked about earlier.


342
00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:24.550 line:-1 position:50%
So tables are
a really powerful control,


343
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.386 line:-1 position:50%
but it's important
to use them correctly.


344
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,923 line:-1
These tables built into iOS 16
are built to show


345
00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:34.594 line:-1 position:50%
more information
about a list of content,


346
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,230 line:-1
not to show
a spreadsheet of data.


347
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.498 line:-1 position:50%
You can think of them
as an extended version


348
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,502 line:-1
of the list views that you
already have in your app.


349
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,640 line:-1
In fact, when you resize an app
to a compact width,


350
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,845 line:-1
tables will switch back
into being single-column lists.


351
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,114 line:-1
And when they do,
we recommend


352
00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:57.817 line:-1 position:50%
taking those details
from the secondary columns


353
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,752 line:-1
and moving that information


354
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,522 line:-1
into a secondary line of text
within each row


355
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,727 line:-1
so all of that information
is still available.


356
00:17:07.727 --> 00:17:10.663 line:-1 position:50%
And for sorting,
you can use a toolbar button


357
00:17:10.663 --> 00:17:13.699 line:-1 position:50%
to quickly reveal
the sort options.


358
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,870 line:-1
So those are the new components
and features in iPadOS 16.


359
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.171 line:-1 position:50%
Let's go back to Bryant


360
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,375 line:-1
to recap everything
we talked about today.


361
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,676 line:-1
Bryant: Thanks, Grant.


362
00:17:23.676 --> 00:17:25.111 line:-1 position:50%
A lot of the features
we covered today


363
00:17:25.111 --> 00:17:29.215 line:-1 position:50%
are aimed around helping users
be more productive with iPad.


364
00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.684 line:-1 position:50%
As you think about how
these relate to your iPad app,


365
00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:34.186 line:-1 position:50%
consider how you can
make your app more powerful


366
00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:37.023 line:-1 position:50%
by offering more functionality,
better organization,


367
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,060 line:-1
and make common editing and
browsing tasks more efficient.


368
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,529 line:-1
Evaluate your app design
in resizable windows


369
00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:45.431 line:-1 position:50%
and larger screens.


370
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,233 line:-1
And ensure your app
works seamlessly


371
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,468 line:-1
with touch and pointer.


372
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,270 line:0
Grant: And if you want
an overview


373
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,407 position:50%
of what goes into designing
a great iPad app,


374
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,109 line:0
you should make sure
to check out our previous talk,


375
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,145 line:0
"Designed for iPad."


376
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,847 line:-1
Bryant: Thanks for watching.
