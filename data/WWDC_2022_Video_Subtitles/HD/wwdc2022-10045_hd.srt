Nadia Hussein: Welcome to WWDC!


5
00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.849 line:-1 position:50%
I'm Nadia, and my colleague
Graham and I are so thrilled


6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,619 line:-1
to tell you about all the new
device management features


7
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:25,993 line:-1
we have for macOS Ventura
and iOS and iPadOS 16.


8
00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:27.794 line:-1 position:50%
In the world
of device management,


9
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,731 line:-1
it's our shared responsibility
to enable employees


10
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:32.532 line:-1 position:50%
to thrive in the workforce


11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,068 line:-1
and increase
student-teacher productivity.


12
00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.905 line:-1 position:50%
We're continuously developing
the tools and technology


13
00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.842 line:-1 position:50%
to help foster
this collaboration.


14
00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:45.746 line:-1 position:50%
And with macOS Ventura
and iOS and iPadOS 16,


15
00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:48.615 line:-1 position:50%
there are many great
enhancements and features,


16
00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:51.018 line:-1 position:50%
some of which
we'll cover in this session.


17
00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:53.687 line:-1 position:50%
But first, I'd like
to briefly highlight


18
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,456 line:-1
a few of the additional sessions
where you can discover


19
00:00:56.456 --> 00:01:01.628 line:-1 position:50%
even more about the enterprise
and education space.


20
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,064 line:-1
During WWDC 2021,


21
00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.767 line:-1 position:50%
we introduced declarative
device management,


22
00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.769 line:-1 position:50%
a new paradigm
for device management


23
00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:11.571 line:-1 position:50%
that makes devices
more autonomous and proactive,


24
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.775 line:-1 position:50%
while allowing servers
to be lightweight and reactive.


25
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:18,912 position:50%
This year we are expanding
declarative device management


26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,615 position:50%
with new platform support
and new features.


27

Managed device attestation
is a new security feature


38
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,484 line:-1
that uses the Secure Enclave


39
00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:00.620 line:-1 position:50%

In this session,
we're going to discuss


44
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:16,203 line:-1
new capabilities
with Apple Configurator;


45
00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:20.140 line:-1 position:50%
identity technologies
across platforms;


46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,977 line:-1
protocol modifications
to macOS Ventura,


47
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.446 line:-1 position:50%
iOS and iPadOS 16;


48
00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:31.451 line:-1 position:50%
and an exciting change
to how we provide documentation.


49
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:36,289 line:-1
Let's start with
Apple Configurator.


50
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:41,228 line:-1
At WWDC 2021, we announced
Apple Configurator for iPhone.


51
00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.430 line:-1 position:50%
Education and enterprise
customers


52
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,766 line:-1
love having this solution
to take advantage


53
00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:50.904 line:-1 position:50%
of automated device enrollment
for all of their Macs.


54
00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:54.141 line:-1 position:50%
Apple Configurator for iPhone
makes it easy to add a Mac


55
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.376 line:-1 position:50%
purchased outside
of the normal channel


56
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,712 line:-1
to their organization
in Apple School Manager


57
00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:02.049 line:-1 position:50%
or Apple Business Manager.


58
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,285 line:-1
In Setup Assistant on a Mac,


59
00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:07.487 line:-1 position:50%
simply hold your iPhone
running Configurator


60
00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:10.223 line:-1 position:50%
[CHIME]
over the animation.


61
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,259 line:-1
The Mac will then
connect to the internet


62
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:16,563 line:-1
and add itself
to your organization.


63
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:20,400 line:-1
Version 1.0.1 brought new,
explicit support


64
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.936 line:-1 position:50%
for taking advantage
of existing network connectivity


65
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,638 line:-1
if available on the Mac.


66
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:31,111 line:-1
And we are excited to announce
that with iOS and iPadOS 16,


67
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:34,247 line:-1
Apple Configurator for iPhone
can now also add


68
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:38,919 line:-1
iPhone and iPad devices
to your organization.


69
00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:43.290 line:-1 position:50%
This works just as you expect,
just like adding a Mac.


70
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,126 line:-1
It's a great new alternative
to the version of this feature


71
00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:47.694 line:-1 position:50%
in Configurator for Mac,


72
00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.363 line:-1 position:50%
which requires connecting
each device via USB


73
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,767 line:-1
to the Mac running Configurator.


74
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,536 line:-1
A key difference
for iOS and iPadOS


75
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,406 line:-1
is which pane in Setup Assistant
you scan.


76
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:02.342 line:-1 position:50%
On iOS and iPadOS,
that's Wi-Fi,


77
00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:05.078 line:-1 position:50%
but on macOS,
it's country or region.


78
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:09.449 line:-1 position:50%
And remember, any device that
requires interactive activation,


79
00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.686 line:-1 position:50%
such as activation lock
or cellular carrier activation,


80
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,154 line:-1
must be handled manually


81
00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:16.289 line:-1 position:50%
before adding it
to your organization,


82
00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.626 line:-1 position:50%
just like Configurator for Mac.


83
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,562 line:-1
Devices running iOS
or iPadOS 16


84
00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:25.832 line:-1 position:50%
can be added using the version
of Apple Configurator for iPhone


85
00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:29.102 line:-1 position:50%
currently in the App Store.


86
00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:32.072 line:-1 position:50%
Now, lets cover
identity management


87
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,841 line:-1
for business and education.


88
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.512 line:-1 position:50%
We know identity management
is important for the industry


89
00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:41.481 line:-1 position:50%
and it's a key priority
for Apple as well.


90
00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:44.951 line:-1 position:50%
It enables our users
to have a cohesive experience,


91
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.554 line:-1 position:50%
while ensuring
security of their data.


92
00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:54.227 line:-1 position:50%
Our goal for identity
is for users to sign in once,


93
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,428 line:-1
and from then on,


94
00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:59.299 line:-1 position:50%
use that identity consistently
across the operating system.


95
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,901 line:-1
We're working towards that goal,


96
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:03.336 line:-1 position:50%
and there's a lot of technology
that supports that,


97
00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:06.206 line:-1 position:50%
including the new features
in macOS Ventura


98
00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:10.744 line:-1 position:50%
and iOS and iPadOS 16.


99
00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:13.847 line:-1 position:50%
For Federated Authentication,
Apple Business Manager


100
00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:15.949 line:-1 position:50%
now integrates
with Google Workspace


101
00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.884 line:-1 position:50%
as an Identity Provider.


102
00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:20.220 line:-1 position:50%
This allows users to leverage
their work credentials


103
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,190 line:-1
as Managed Apple IDs
for authentication to services


104
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.594 line:-1 position:50%
on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.


105
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,863 line:-1
And remember,
use Directory Sync --


106
00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:31.798 line:-1 position:50%
which we've formerly
referred to as SCIM --


107
00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:37.437 line:-1 position:50%
to create the user accounts as
Managed Apple IDs automatically.


108
00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:40.840 line:-1 position:50%
Sign in with Apple can now
be used at work and school


109
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,676 line:-1
with Managed Apple IDs.


110
00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.744 line:-1 position:50%
In apps that support
Sign in with Apple,


111
00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:46.580 line:-1 position:50%
this will just work!


112
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.182 line:-1 position:50%
If you want to control
where users can sign in,


113
00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.717 line:-1 position:50%
you can choose to allow all apps


114
00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:53.153 line:-1 position:50%
or add apps
to an explicit allow list


115
00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:56.456 line:-1 position:50%
in Apple School Manager
or Apple Business Manager.


116
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,791 position:50%
Learn more in the session,


117

"Discover Sign in with Apple
at Work & School."


118
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,497 line:-1
Another notable
identity management update


119
00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:06.333 line:-1 position:50%
is OAuth support.


120
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,568 line:-1
In iOS and iPadOS 15,


121
00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:12.072 line:-1 position:50%
we used a simple access token
authorization mechanism


122
00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:15.909 line:-1 position:50%
to allow the MDM server
to verify the identity of users.


123
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.113 line:-1 position:50%
In iOS and iPadOS 16,
we are adding OAuth 2


124
00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:22.816 line:-1 position:50%
as another authorization
mechanism.


125
00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:25.452 line:-1 position:50%
OAuth opens the door
for MDM servers


126
00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:28.221 line:-1 position:50%
to support a wide variety
of identity providers


127
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,156 line:-1
already using OAuth today.


128
00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:34.094 line:-1 position:50%
It also improves security
via its refresh token mechanism,


129
00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:36.630 line:-1 position:50%
which allows a short-lived
access token to be used


130
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.832 line:-1 position:50%
in conjunction
with a silent refresh


131
00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:42.002 line:-1 position:50%
that won't prompt the user
for credentials.


132
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,670 line:-1
OAuth can be used
with the existing


133
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,139 line:-1
account-driven
user enrollment flow,


134
00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.909 line:-1 position:50%
but it provides an even better
user experience


135
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,345 line:-1
when combined
with a cool new feature.


136
00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:56.049 line:-1 position:50%
We call it
Enrollment Single Sign-on,


137
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,751 line:-1
or Enrollment SSO.


138
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,887 line:-1
It's a new, faster method
for personal devices


139
00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:02.722 line:-1 position:50%
to complete an MDM enrollment


140
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,725 line:-1
and access your organization's
apps and websites


141
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,362 line:-1
with a single authentication.


142
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,465 line:-1
This builds upon
a few existing technologies.


143
00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:17.570 line:-1 position:50%
iOS 13 introduced extensible SSO
as a new way to configure SSO


144
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.508 line:-1 position:50%
for an organization's
apps and websites.


145
00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:23.877 line:-1 position:50%
And iOS and iPadOS 15


146
00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:25.745 line:-1 position:50%
introduced Account-Driven
User Enrollment,


147
00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:27.714 line:-1 position:50%
which allows users
to enroll in MDM


148
00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:30.984 line:-1 position:50%
by just entering their email
address in Settings.


149
00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:33.086 line:-1 position:50%
To make enrollment even better,


150
00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:35.689 line:-1 position:50%
we combined these
two technologies together


151
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:37.757 line:-1 position:50%
because we know BYOD devices


152
00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:41.127 line:-1 position:50%
are an important part
of your deployment.


153
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,998 line:-1
Users start out by entering
their email address in Settings.


154
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,999 line:-1
They are then prompted
to download an app


155
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,668 line:-1
from the App Store.


156
00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:50.136 line:-1 position:50%
This app,
which contains


157
00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:52.605 line:-1 position:50%
an Enrollment Single Sign-on
extension,


158
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,643 line:-1
provides a native UI to perform
the authentication steps.


159
00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.712 line:-1 position:50%
Because this is
an app-based model,


160
00:07:58.712 --> 00:08:02.415 line:-1 position:50%
you can use any authentication
technology you choose.


161
00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:05.118 line:-1 position:50%
As a user, sign in once.


162
00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:08.221 line:-1 position:50%
The app will then sign in to get
you through the enrollment flow


163
00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:12.325 line:-1 position:50%
without having to sign in again.


164
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,327 line:-1
There are four main pieces
required to bring


165
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,529 line:-1
Enrollment Single Sign-on
to life.


166
00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:19.165 line:-1 position:50%
First, the app developer
updates their app


167
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.769 line:-1 position:50%
to support enrollment SSO.


168
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,005 line:-1
Next, MDM vendors
federate MDM protocol


169
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,643 line:-1
client authentication
with an identity provider.


170
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,613 line:-1
Then administrators set up
Managed Apple IDs


171
00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:37.217 line:-1 position:50%
using Apple School Manager
or Apple Business Manager


172
00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:40.954 line:-1 position:50%
and finally, configure
the MDM Server to return a URL


173
00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:42.522 line:-1 position:50%
to the JSON document


174
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:46.493 line:-1 position:50%
in the authentication response
headers.


175
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,828 line:-1
Now that we've talked
about what this feature does


176
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:54,567 line:-1
and who needs to do what,
let's dive into the details.


177
00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.669 line:-1 position:50%
When the initial authentication
challenge from the server


178
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,039 line:-1
is received, there will be
an HTTP header present


179
00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:02.609 line:-1 position:50%
indicating that Enrollment
Single Sign-on is available


180
00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:04.310 line:-1 position:50%
and should be used.


181
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.214 line:-1 position:50%
That header's value will be
a URL that the client will use


182
00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:11.451 line:-1 position:50%
to download a JSON document.


183
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,053 line:-1
The JSON document
contains all the details


184
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:18,091 line:-1
the client needs
to continue the enrollment.


185
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,894 line:-1
The value for
the iTunesStoreID key


186
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,996 line:-1
must refer to the
Enrollment Single Sign-on app


187
00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:26.466 line:-1 position:50%
to be used during enrollment.


188
00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:29.803 line:-1 position:50%
The AssociatedDomains keys
are the same keys available


189
00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:35.875 line:-1 position:50%
in ApplicationAttributes and can
be configured here as well.


190
00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:37.811 line:-1 position:50%
Finally,
the ConfigurationProfile


191
00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:40.280 line:-1 position:50%
should be a
Base64EncodedProfile


192
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,283 line:-1
that contains at least
one Extensible SSO payload


193
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:48,621 line:-1
and may contain certificate
payloads if needed.


194
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:51.591 line:-1 position:50%
And we'll be shipping
this feature for customers


195
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,328 line:-1
in a later release of iOS
and iPadOS 16.


196
00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:57.564 line:-1 position:50%
If you are interested
in developing an app


197
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,265 line:-1
that supports this feature,


198
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,134 line:-1
you'll need to apply
for a new entitlement


199
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:05,071 line:-1
though the Apple
Developer Program.


200
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,208 line:-1
However, you can start
developing for this now


201
00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:10.210 line:-1 position:50%
using test mode.


202
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.478 line:-1 position:50%
This is a special version


203
00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:13.546 line:-1 position:50%
of the Enrollment
Single Sign-on process


204
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,814 line:-1
that allows you to test your app


205
00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:19.285 line:-1 position:50%
before it's even offered
on the App Store.


206
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,753 line:-1
To get started with test mode,


207
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,822 line:-1
head to the Developer section
of Settings


208
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:26,226 line:-1
and enable Enrollment
Single Sign-on test mode.


209
00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:28.928 line:-1 position:50%
You'll then need to configure
your authentication response


210
00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:30.864 line:-1 position:50%
with the new HTTP header


211
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:34,000 line:-1
and the corresponding
JSON document.


212
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.202 line:-1 position:50%
Then, in VPN
and Device Management,


213
00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:38.338 line:-1 position:50%
start the enrollment process.


214
00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:39.305 line:-1 position:50%
During the enrollment,


215
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,475 line:-1
you'll be prompted to install
the Single Sign-on app.


216
00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:45.545 line:-1 position:50%
You can install the app
using any method available


217
00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:50.250 line:-1 position:50%
from Xcode to TestFlight or even
Enterprise app distribution.


218
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:55.555 line:-1 position:50%
After that, return to Settings
and complete the enrollment.


219
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,291 line:-1
To use test mode, there is
a different header required


220
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:02,729 line:-1
in the response
and a modified JSON document.


221
00:11:02.729 --> 00:11:06.933 line:-1 position:50%
Here's an example of the JSON
document for test mode.


222
00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:08.968 line:-1 position:50%
You'll notice
the iTunesStoreID key


223
00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:11.237 line:-1 position:50%
has been replaced
by the AppIDs key


224
00:11:11.237 --> 00:11:13.540 line:-1 position:50%
and the value of this key
is an array of strings


225
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.509 line:-1 position:50%
containing the App IDs
that can be used for enrollment.


226
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,080 line:-1
Everything else
remains the same.


227
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.951 line:-1 position:50%
Next, let's explore
Single Sign-on extensions.


228
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,787 line:-1
In 2019, we added
Single Sign-On extensions


229
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,557 line:-1
to iOS 13 and macOS Catalina


230
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,993 line:-1
to enable identity providers
to use SSO authentication


231
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,729 line:-1
for all the apps and websites
for their users.


232
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,165 position:50%
When using SSO extensions,


233
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,501 position:50%
the user is prompted
to sign in to the extension


234
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,636 position:50%
after they've unlocked
the device,


235
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,205 line:0
which means entering
credentials twice.


236
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,209 line:0
If an organization also uses
the built-in Kerberos extension,


237
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,378 position:50%
the user may have
to sign in again.


238
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,549 position:50%
In many cases, these are all
identical credentials.


239
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,587 line:-1
Well, in macOS Ventura,
we're introducing


240
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:04,290 line:-1
Platform Single Sign-On --
or Platform SSO --


241
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.727 line:-1 position:50%
to enable users to sign in once
at the login window


242
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:12,599 line:-1
and then automatically
sign in to apps and websites.


243
00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:15.101 line:-1 position:50%
Platform SSO makes
tokens from the login


244
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:17.837 line:-1 position:50%
available to third-party
SSO extensions


245
00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:23.309 line:-1 position:50%
and also works with the built-in
Kerberos extension.


246
00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:26.579 line:-1 position:50%
The first login authenticates
with a local account password,


247
00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.849 line:-1 position:50%
which also unlocks FileVault
encryption on the device.


248
00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:32.418 line:-1 position:50%
This enables the user
to login when offline


249
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,421 line:-1
or when connected
to captive networks.


250
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.924 line:-1 position:50%
From then on,
their identity provider password


251
00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.093 line:-1 position:50%
can be used for unlock.


252
00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:43.429 line:-1 position:50%
Additionally, Platform SSO
supports the use of a password


253
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,298 line:-1
or a Secure Enclave backed key


254
00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:47.834 line:-1 position:50%
to authenticate
with the identity provider.


255
00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:50.269 line:-1 position:50%
And regardless of
the authentication method,


256
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:53.373 line:-1 position:50%
the SSO tokens are retrieved
from the identity provider,


257
00:12:53.373 --> 00:12:54.540 line:-1 position:50%
stored in the keychain,


258
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,677 line:-1
and made available
to the SSO extension.


259
00:12:57.677 --> 00:13:00.446 line:-1 position:50%
Kerberos TGTs
can also be retrieved,


260
00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:02.015 line:-1 position:50%
imported to a credential cache,


261
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:05,318 line:-1
and optionally shared
with the Kerberos extension.


262
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,054 position:50%
If the identity provider
password changes,


263
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,289 position:50%
Platform SSO will validate
that new password


264
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,693 position:50%
with the identity provider
on unlock.


265
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,496 line:-1
Platform SSO is
a fully integrated protocol


266
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,998 line:-1
that is built using OAuth
and OpenID


267
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,135 line:-1
and does not use web views
for authentication.


268
00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:26.673 line:-1 position:50%
Platform SSO is the modern
replacement for AD binding


269
00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:28.408 line:-1 position:50%
and mobile accounts.


270
00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:31.411 line:-1 position:50%
Note, it does not directly use
directory services,


271
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,046 line:-1
or check with
the identity provider


272
00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:34.781 line:-1 position:50%
for each unlock attempt.


273
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:37.517 line:-1 position:50%
Instead, the identity provider
is only called


274
00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:40.820 line:-1 position:50%
when the user is attempting
to use a new password at unlock


275
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,890 line:-1
or to retrieve SSO tokens.


276
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,360 line:-1
Platform SSO also does not
prevent logging in to the Mac


277
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,063 line:-1
based on the response
from the identity provider.


278
00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:52.298 line:-1 position:50%
For that purpose,
leverage MDM


279
00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:57.236 line:-1 position:50%
or alternative strategies
to disable access.


280
00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:58.905 line:-1 position:50%
To take advantage
of this feature,


281
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:02,008 line:-1
the identity provider needs
to implement the SSO protocol


282
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,510 line:-1
and update their SSO extension,


283
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.447 line:-1 position:50%
then ensure the extensible SSO
profile is updated


284
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:11,951 line:-1
to support the new keys
on managed devices.


285
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,786 line:0
Find more implementation
details


286
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:17,724 line:0
in the Apple Platform
Deployment guide.


287
00:14:17.724 --> 00:14:20.393 line:-1 position:50%
To recap,
we've introduced integration


288
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,896 line:-1
with Google Workspace,
Enrollment SSO,


289
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,033 line:-1
OAuth support,
and Platform SSO,


290
00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:30.636 line:-1 position:50%
to contribute to
a simplified sign-in experience.


291
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,407 line:-1
Identity management is
an ever-evolving technology


292
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:39,112 line:-1
and we are just getting started.


293
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:43,349 line:-1
macOS Ventura brings many
enhancements across OS updates,


294
00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:45.418 line:-1 position:50%
enrollment, and security.


295
00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:49.722 line:-1 position:50%
Let's start
with software updates.


296
00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:52.391 line:-1 position:50%
macOS Monterey introduced
fundamental changes


297
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393 line:-1
to Managed Software Updates.


298
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,497 line:0
My colleague Lucy
covered this in the session,


299
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,299 position:50%
"Manage software updates
in your organization,"


300
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,338 line:0
where we break down
OS updates into three areas:


301
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:08,441 line:-1
test, deploy, and enforce.


302
00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:11.244 line:-1 position:50%
This year, we focus
on even more additions


303
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:15,148 line:-1
to deploy and enforce.


304
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,885 line:-1
Historically, all OS Update
commands would return a NotNow


305
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,087 line:-1
when sent while in
Power Nap mode.


306
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,389 line:-1
To ensure a more consistent
and robust


307
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:27.093 line:-1 position:50%
OS Update deployment process,
the device will now acknowledge


308
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:31,597 line:-1
and respond to ScheduleOSUpdate,
OSUpdateStatus,


309
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,999 line:-1
and AvailableOSUpdate
commands


310
00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:37.570 line:-1 position:50%
even when the device is asleep
or in Power Nap mode.


311
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.540 line:-1 position:50%
Since we also understand
that sometimes administrators


312
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.409 line:-1 position:50%
want an OS update
as soon as possible,


313
00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:46.479 line:-1 position:50%
we've introduced
a new key called "priority"


314
00:15:46.479 --> 00:15:49.248 line:-1 position:50%
sent via the ScheduleOSUpdate
command.


315
00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:51.851 line:-1 position:50%
Accepting a string value
of High or Low,


316
00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:53.419 line:-1 position:50%
it controls
the scheduling priority


317
00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:56.355 line:-1 position:50%
for downloading and preparing
the requested update.


318
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,457 line:0
Sending the command
with a High priority


319
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,427 position:50%
will mimic as if the user had
requested the update themselves


320
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,296 line:0
in system settings.


321
00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:08.534 line:-1 position:50%
Note that this key is only
supported for minor OS updates.


322
00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:13.139 line:-1 position:50%
In macOS 12.3, we added
even more admin visibility


323
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:19,345 line:-1
into the logs and reporting
with the OSUpdateStatus command.


324
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,648 line:-1
DeferralsRemaining indicates
how many notifications are left


325
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,285 line:-1
to prompt the user to update.


326
00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:28.788 line:-1 position:50%
MaxDeferrals reveals
the total number of times


327
00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:34.527 line:-1 position:50%
a user is allowed to defer
the OS update notifications.


328
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,863 line:-1
NextScheduledInstall
is the date that the OS


329
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,600 line:-1
will attempt to install
the update next.


330
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.537 line:-1 position:50%
And finally, PastNotifications
is the exact dates and times


331
00:16:44.537 --> 00:16:49.041 line:-1 position:50%
when the notification
was posted to the user.


332
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:52.111 line:-1 position:50%
All of these updates
to the OSUpdateStatus command


333
00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:53.646 line:-1 position:50%
will be useful
for administrators


334
00:16:53.646 --> 00:16:58.918 line:-1 position:50%
to have further clarity into
the compliance of their users.


335
00:16:58.918 --> 00:17:02.421 line:-1 position:50%
macOS Ventura
and iOS and iPadOS 16


336
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:03.923 line:-1 position:50%
are introducing a new mechanism


337
00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:07.894 line:-1 position:50%
to ship critical security fixes
to users more quickly.


338
00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:10.029 line:-1 position:50%
It does not modify the firmware,


339
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.932 line:-1 position:50%
and the user can also remove
the Rapid Security Response


340
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,734 line:-1
if necessary.


341
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:18,237 line:-1
We are introducing
two restriction keys for this.


342
00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:21.173 line:-1 position:50%
Use allowRapidSecurity
ResponseInstallation


343
00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:24.610 line:-1 position:50%
to disable this new
security response mechanism,


344
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,446 line:-1
and use allowRapidSecurity
ResponseRemoval


345
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,881 line:-1
to block the end user


346
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:34,353 line:-1
from being able to remove
a Rapid Security Response.


347
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:39,392 line:-1
Now, let's cover a couple
enrollment changes.


348
00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:42.895 line:-1 position:50%
Automated device enrollment
provides a streamlined process


349
00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.698 line:-1 position:50%
for the device to be
unboxed, activated,


350
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:50,236 line:-1
and enrolled in the
organization's MDM solution.


351
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,904 line:-1
In an upcoming release,


352
00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.006 line:-1 position:50%
after erasing
or restoring a Mac,


353
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,008 line:-1
an internet connection
will be required


354
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,643 line:-1
to go through Setup Assistant


355
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,146 line:-1
for devices registered
to your organization


356
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:03,749 line:-1
in Apple School Manager
or Apple Business Manager.


357
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,785 line:-1
Once the Mac is set up
for the first time


358
00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:07.620 line:-1 position:50%
and connected to a network,


359
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.424 line:-1 position:50%
the Mac is acknowledged
as owned by an organization.


360
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,093 line:-1
If later on, for example,
MDM initiates


361
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.195 line:-1 position:50%
an Erase All Content
and Settings


362
00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:18.864 line:-1 position:50%
or the device is restored
with Configurator,


363
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,533 line:-1
then the network --


364
00:18:20.533 --> 00:18:22.335 line:-1 position:50%
and therefore,
device enrollment --


365
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,137 line:-1
cannot be bypassed
in Setup Assistant.


366
00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:27.239 line:-1 position:50%
Stay tuned with
the AppleSeed for IT


367
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:31,644 line:-1
release notes for timing.


368
00:18:31.644 --> 00:18:34.380 line:-1 position:50%
The profiles command line tool
has been a staple


369
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.249 line:-1 position:50%
for MDM deployments,
migrations, and reporting


370
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,885 line:-1
in admins' tool kits
for many years now,


371
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:44,724 line:-1
and we have an update to how
it works as of macOS Ventura.


372
00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:46.125 line:-1 position:50%
Profiles tool will start


373
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,428 line:-1
enforcing rate limiting
on macOS.


374
00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:50.763 line:-1 position:50%
This will only be for


375
00:18:50.763 --> 00:18:52.932 line:-1 position:50%
organization-owned
enrollment types


376
00:18:52.932 --> 00:18:57.003 line:-1 position:50%
and to the show, renew,
and validate commands.


377
00:18:57.003 --> 00:19:00.539 line:-1 position:50%
Each command has a maximum
of 10 requests per day


378
00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:03.509 line:-1 position:50%
from the server,
and if that number is exceeded,


379
00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:06.579 line:-1 position:50%
the results will return
cached information.


380
00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:09.348 line:-1 position:50%
When you don't want to use
one of the 10 requests,


381
00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:11.384 line:-1 position:50%
the show command
has a new, optional flag


382
00:19:11.384 --> 00:19:14.053 line:-1 position:50%
to return cached information.


383
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,921 line:-1
Refer to the profiles
manual page


384
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:20,059 line:-1
for more detailed information.


385
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:23,262 line:-1
In each release of macOS,
we continue to improve


386
00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:26.599 line:-1 position:50%
protection capabilities
for our users.


387
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:32,505 line:-1
Here are a few upcoming
security changes to be aware of.


388
00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:35.274 line:-1 position:50%
In iOS 10.3,
we introduced a change


389
00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:38.778 line:-1 position:50%
in the default TLS trust policy
for certificate payloads


390
00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:41.914 line:-1 position:50%
to enhance overall protection
for our users.


391
00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:45.317 line:-1 position:50%
In a future release,
we'll be bringing it to macOS,


392
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,521 line:-1
meaning manually-installed
certificate payloads


393
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.924 line:-1 position:50%
will no longer be trusted
for TLS purposes,


394
00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:56.195 line:-1 position:50%
unless the user grants them that
trust using Keychain Access.


395
00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:59.665 line:-1 position:50%
Note, we will still continue
full certificate trust


396
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,269 line:-1
if it's a certificate embedded
in an MDM profile,


397
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,671 line:-1
but be sure to update
any workflows


398
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:11,043 line:-1
if it involves interactive
certificate installation.


399
00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:14.780 line:-1 position:50%
Next, "Allow accessories
to connect" on macOS


400
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.384 line:-1 position:50%
aims to protect our customers
from close-access attacks.


401
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,620 line:-1
Supported on portable Macs
with Apple silicon,


402
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.190 line:-1 position:50%
the initial configuration
is to ask the user


403
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,460 line:-1
to allow new Thunderbolt
or USB accessories,


404
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.896 line:-1 position:50%
even when unlocked.


405
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,132 line:-1
Approved accessories
can connect to a locked Mac


406
00:20:33.132 --> 00:20:34.800 line:-1 position:50%
for up to three days.


407
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.503 line:-1 position:50%
If you attach an unknown
accessory to a locked Mac,


408
00:20:37.503 --> 00:20:40.039 line:-1 position:50%
you will be prompted
to unlock the Mac.


409
00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:43.109 line:-1 position:50%
From an MDM perspective,
we understand this may


410
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,644 line:-1
impact enterprise
and education workflows


411
00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:48.147 line:-1 position:50%
such as bulk provisioning
or test taking.


412
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:51,083 line:-1
To address this, we are
leveraging the same restriction


413
00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:54.820 line:-1 position:50%
offered on iOS and iPadOS
for macOS.


414
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,224 line:-1
The existing allowUSBRestrictedMode restriction


415
00:20:58.224 --> 00:20:59.658 line:-1 position:50%
will allow wired accessories


416
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,962 line:-1
to always connect
without any limitation.


417
00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:04.463 line:-1 position:50%
It provides authorization


418
00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:07.566 line:-1 position:50%
to bypass the requirement
of user consent.


419
00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:08.834 line:-1 position:50%
Also remember,


420
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,872 line:-1
this inherently makes
your user's system less secure,


421
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,974 line:-1
so please only use
this restriction if you have


422
00:21:14.974 --> 00:21:19.612 line:-1 position:50%
a legitimate business need
to do so.


423
00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.281 line:-1 position:50%
For other restrictions
and payload modifications,


424
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.517 line:-1 position:50%
such as the new
allowUniversalControl


425
00:21:24.517 --> 00:21:27.219 line:-1 position:50%
and UIConfigurationProfileInstallation,


426
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,989 line:-1
be sure to check out
the documentation.


427
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,958 line:-1
Thanks for listening
to the exciting changes


428
00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.960 line:-1 position:50%
coming to macOS Ventura.


429
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.430 line:-1 position:50%
Now I'm going to hand it over
to Graham to talk about iOS.


430
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.398 line:-1 position:50%
Graham McLuhan: Thank you,
Nadia!


431
00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:41.133 line:-1 position:50%
I'm really excited to be here
today to tell you about


432
00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:43.402 line:-1 position:50%
a ton of great new
device management features


433
00:21:43.402 --> 00:21:47.406 line:-1 position:50%
in iOS and iPadOS 16.


434
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,675 line:-1
We know managing
network traffic on devices


435
00:21:49.675 --> 00:21:53.145 line:-1 position:50%
is an important way to improve
the security of your data.


436
00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.413 line:-1 position:50%
There are three main ways


437
00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:57.049 line:-1 position:50%
that you can manage traffic
on Apple devices:


438
00:21:57.049 --> 00:22:01.187 line:-1 position:50%
VPN, DNS Proxy,
and Web Content Filter.


439
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:04,456 line:-1
For many years now,
we've offered per-app VPN --


440
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,358 line:-1
and in fact,
for user-enrolled devices,


441
00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:10.596 line:-1 position:50%
this is the only type of VPN
available to MDM.


442
00:22:10.596 --> 00:22:12.698 line:-1 position:50%
In iOS and iPadOS 16,


443
00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:14.633 line:-1 position:50%
we're expanding
our per-app offerings


444
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,870 line:-1
to include DNS Proxy
and Web Content Filter.


445
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,673 line:-1
These features will be available
on all enrollment types


446
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.775 line:-1 position:50%
but we think they'll be
particularly useful


447
00:22:22.775 --> 00:22:23.909 line:-1 position:50%
for user enrollment


448
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,711 line:-1
since this is
the first time organizations


449
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:29,582 line:-1
can secure their app traffic
in this way for BYOD.


450
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,551 line:-1
Configuring these new features
is a two-step process


451
00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:35.354 line:-1 position:50%
that will feel very similar
to Per-App VPN.


452
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,991 line:-1
Let's take a quick look
at how it's done.


453
00:22:38.991 --> 00:22:41.594 line:-1 position:50%
First you'll need to add
a new key value pair


454
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,128 line:-1
to each payload.


455
00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:45.097 line:-1 position:50%
In the Web Content Filter
payload,


456
00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:47.700 line:-1 position:50%
ContentFilterUUID.


457
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,037 line:-1
And for DNS Proxy,
DNSProxyUUID.


458
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,007 line:-1
There are a few things
to be aware of with these keys.


459
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:59,745 line:-1
First, the values for these keys
can be any arbitrary string.


460
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,481 line:-1
And second, when this key
is added to the payload,


461
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,451 line:-1
it can only be installed
via MDM.


462
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:09,355 line:-1
Now, we need to configure the
apps to use these new features.


463
00:23:09.355 --> 00:23:11.590 line:-1 position:50%
Using either the
InstallApplication command


464
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,492 line:-1
or the Settings command,


465
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,528 line:-1
add the same UUID
to the attributes of the app


466
00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:18.697 line:-1 position:50%
that will use
the per-app feature.


467
00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:21.300 line:-1 position:50%
In this example,
we included both keys,


468
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,070 line:-1
but you can just include
one or the other.


469
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,773 line:-1
A few additional details
I'd like to point out.


470
00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:31.844 line:-1 position:50%
First, app developers
don't need to do anything new!


471
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:34,780 line:-1
All existing DNS Proxy
and Web Content Filter apps


472
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,649 line:-1
will just work.


473
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,585 line:-1
Second, you can have
multiple DNS Proxies


474
00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:43.489 line:-1 position:50%
but you cannot mix system-wide
and per-app proxies.


475
00:23:43.489 --> 00:23:46.258 line:-1 position:50%
And finally,
for Web Content Filters,


476
00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.227 line:-1 position:50%
you can have up to seven
per-app filters


477
00:23:48.227 --> 00:23:51.964 line:-1 position:50%
and one system-wide filter.


478
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,733 line:-1
Next, I'd like to talk about
managing eSIMs.


479
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,669 line:-1
eSIM has become
the new standard


480
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:59.705 line:-1 position:50%
for carriers around the world,
and over the last few years,


481
00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:01.740 line:-1 position:50%
we've added
a number of MDM features


482
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,877 line:-1
to make managing eSIM
easier than ever.


483
00:24:04.877 --> 00:24:07.179 line:-1 position:50%
We wanted to take a moment
to talk about how MDM vendors


484
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,081 line:-1
can bring all these features
together


485
00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:11.917 line:-1 position:50%
to make for a better experience.


486
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,420 line:-1
When we talk to organizations
using eSIM,


487
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.255 line:-1 position:50%
some of the primary tasks
they are doing


488
00:24:16.255 --> 00:24:18.757 line:-1 position:50%
are provisioning new devices,


489
00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:20.726 line:-1 position:50%
migrating devices
between carriers,


490
00:24:20.726 --> 00:24:22.594 line:-1 position:50%
and supporting users
with requirements


491
00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:27.066 line:-1 position:50%
such as multiple carriers
or traveling and roaming.


492
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,334 line:-1
To accomplish these goals,


493
00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:30.769 line:-1 position:50%
they need to query data
from enrolled devices


494
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,138 line:-1
and provide that data
to carriers.


495
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,807 line:-1
And second,
they need the ability


496
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:38,177 line:-1
to install an eSIM on a device.


497
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,112 line:-1
Let's begin by discussing
the device query


498
00:24:40.112 --> 00:24:42.448 line:-1 position:50%
and carrier data requirements.


499
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,983 line:-1
The DeviceInformation query
is the easiest way


500
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,952 line:-1
to collect data from a device.


501
00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:49.655 line:-1 position:50%
And in iOS 12,
the ServiceSubscriptions key


502
00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:52.725 line:-1 position:50%
became the one stop shop
for collecting all data


503
00:24:52.725 --> 00:24:57.396 line:-1 position:50%
relating to cellular
on iPhone and iPad.


504
00:24:57.396 --> 00:25:01.066 line:-1 position:50%
A few points you may find useful
when looking at these responses.


505
00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:04.336 line:-1 position:50%
Devices that return two items
in the ServiceSubscriptions


506
00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:07.539 line:-1 position:50%
support two active
cellular plans.


507
00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:11.677 line:-1 position:50%
If the response contains an EID,
it's an eSIM.


508
00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:15.914 line:-1 position:50%
Newer devices like iPhone 13
and iPhone SE (3rd generation)


509
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:19,118 line:-1
support dual active carrier
eSIM profiles


510
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,120 line:-1
so it's possible to have
more than one eSIM


511
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,022 line:-1
returned in the
ServiceSubscriptions response.


512
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:28,127 line:-1
Note that the EID
is unique per device.


513
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,896 line:-1
Starting with iOS
and iPadOS 16,


514
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,365 line:-1
otherDeviceInformation
queries that return data


515
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:36.034 line:-1 position:50%
which also appear in the
ServiceSubscriptions response


516
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,470 line:-1
are deprecated
and will no longer be returned


517
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.707 line:-1 position:50%
in a future version
of the operating system.


518
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,876 line:-1
Now that we know
how to get data from the device,


519
00:25:43.876 --> 00:25:47.012 line:-1 position:50%
let's take a look at what
we need to give to the carrier.


520
00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:49.481 line:-1 position:50%
In general, they require
four pieces of data


521
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,917 line:-1
to get an eSIM
set up for a device:


522
00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:56.789 line:-1 position:50%
IMEI, EID, serial number,
and phone number.


523
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:59.158 line:-1 position:50%
Giving your admins
the ability to generate reports


524
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:01,894 line:-1
containing all this data
will make it easier for them


525
00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:04.196 line:-1 position:50%
to get up and running
with eSIM.


526
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:06,398 line:-1
Let's pull this all together
and review


527
00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:08.634 line:-1 position:50%
how eSIMs get provisioned.


528
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:12,271 line:-1
First, the MDM server uses
the ServiceSubscriptions query


529
00:26:12.271 --> 00:26:15.541 line:-1 position:50%
to collect the required data
from the device.


530
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:19,311 line:-1
Then, the admin will send
that data to the carrier.


531
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,281 line:-1
And finally, the carrier will
provision eSIMs for the device


532
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,116 line:-1
on their eSIM server.


533
00:26:24.116 --> 00:26:25.617 line:-1 position:50%
We can now shift our focus


534
00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:28.754 line:-1 position:50%
to getting the eSIM
installed on the device.


535
00:26:28.754 --> 00:26:31.857 line:-1 position:50%
The carrier will provide
the customer with a server URL


536
00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:33.358 line:-1 position:50%
where devices
can fetch an eSIM


537
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:37,329 line:-1
using the RefreshCellularPlans
command.


538
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,964 line:0
The MDM server will send


539
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,600 position:50%
the RefreshCellularPlans
command to the device


540
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,503 line:0
which will initiate a request
to the carrier's eSIM server


541
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,805 position:50%
and check if an eSIM
is available.


542
00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:49.541 line:-1 position:50%
If it is, it will automatically
download and install it


543
00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:52.878 line:-1 position:50%
without requiring
any user interaction.


544
00:26:52.878 --> 00:26:56.048 line:-1 position:50%
The MDM server can then use
the ServiceSubscriptions query


545
00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:59.151 line:-1 position:50%
to confirm that the eSIM
has successfully been installed


546
00:26:59.151 --> 00:27:03.121 line:-1 position:50%
when the query returns
a nonempty phone number.


547
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,990 line:-1
Now let's talk about
a few key points


548
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,226 line:-1
that you should keep in mind.


549
00:27:07.226 --> 00:27:09.962 line:-1 position:50%
eSIM installation
is a one-time operation


550
00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:13.332 line:-1 position:50%
and future requests to install
an eSIM on the same device


551
00:27:13.332 --> 00:27:16.668 line:-1 position:50%
require the carrier
to provision a new eSIM.


552
00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:18.203 line:-1 position:50%
To prevent users
from accidentally


553
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,671 line:-1
removing their eSIM,


554
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:22,908 line:-1
use the allowESIMModification
restriction.


555
00:27:22.908 --> 00:27:25.410 line:-1 position:50%
Also note that the
RefreshCellularPlans command


556
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,881 line:-1
can install an eSIM when
the restriction is installed.


557
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,950 line:-1
And finally, MDM could also
remove the eSIM


558
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.552 line:-1 position:50%
when erasing a device.


559
00:27:33.552 --> 00:27:37.589 line:-1 position:50%
To avoid this, be sure to set
the PreserveDataPlan key to True


560
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,791 line:-1
when sending
an EraseDevice command.


561
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,494 line:-1
We hope this information
provides a more complete picture


562
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,664 line:-1
on how to manage
and deploy eSIM.


563
00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:49.568 line:-1 position:50%
Now let's talk about some
updates to Shared iPad.


564
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:53,105 line:-1
Shared iPad is a great way for
education and business customers


565
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,574 line:-1
to use iPad
in a one-to-many environment


566
00:27:55.574 --> 00:27:58.844 line:-1 position:50%
while still giving users
a personalized experience.


567
00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:00.279 line:-1 position:50%
This year we've made
a few changes


568
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:04,049 line:-1
that will make Shared iPad
even better.


569
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,653 line:-1
First, we added
ManagedAppleIDDefaultDomains


570
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:10,556 line:-1
to the SharedDeviceConfiguration
Settings command.


571
00:28:10.556 --> 00:28:12.991 line:-1 position:50%
With this command, you'll be
able to save users time


572
00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:18.063 line:-1 position:50%
entering their Managed Apple ID
using the QuickType keyboard.


573
00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:20.699 line:-1 position:50%
Once the user starts to enter
their Managed Apple ID,


574
00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:22.467 line:-1 position:50%
a typing suggestion
for your domain name


575
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,103 line:-1
will automatically appear
for the user to tap.


576
00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:27.973 line:-1 position:50%
The Settings command
will accept a list of any size


577
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:32,511 line:-1
but only three will be displayed
to the user.


578
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:33,745 line:-1
Next, we've made
some changes


579
00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:36.348 line:-1 position:50%
to the requirements
for remote authentication.


580
00:28:36.348 --> 00:28:39.384 line:-1 position:50%
Currently, Shared iPad
requires remote authentication


581
00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:41.720 line:-1 position:50%
approximately every seven days.


582
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.058 line:-1 position:50%
In iPadOS 16, Shared iPad
will only use local verification


583
00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:48.994 line:-1 position:50%
for existing users
on the device.


584
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:51,530 line:-1
If admins want to enforce
remote authentication,


585
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,531 line:-1
they can set the


586
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,933 line:-1
OnlineAuthenticationGracePeriod
key


587
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,769 line:-1
in the SharedDeviceConfiguration
Settings command.


588
00:28:57.769 --> 00:29:00.172 line:-1 position:50%
This key will be
an integer value that represents


589
00:29:00.172 --> 00:29:03.208 line:-1 position:50%
the number of days
between remote authentications;


590
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,278 line:-1
a value of zero
will require all logins


591
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,313 line:-1
to be remotely authenticated.


592
00:29:08.313 --> 00:29:11.116 line:-1 position:50%
Both the
ManagedAppleIDDefaultDomains


593
00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:13.819 line:-1 position:50%
and OnlineAuthentication
GracePeriod values


594
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:18,023 line:-1
can be retrieved via
the DeviceInformation query.


595
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,258 line:-1
Finally, I wanted to help
provide some clarity


596
00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:22.828 line:-1 position:50%
around Shared iPad quotas.


597
00:29:22.828 --> 00:29:24.329 line:-1 position:50%
The SharedDeviceConfiguration
command


598
00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:27.766 line:-1 position:50%
is the best way to manage quotas
on Shared iPad.


599
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,136 line:-1
There are two relevant keys
that you can use to set quotas:


600
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:34,106 line:-1
QuotaSize and ResidentUsers.


601
00:29:34.106 --> 00:29:36.541 line:-1 position:50%
Regardless of which key
you choose to set,


602
00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:40.178 line:-1 position:50%
ultimately the operating system
is computing a storage quota.


603
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:43,215 line:-1
Let's take a look at an example.


604
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:48,487 line:-1
This iPad has 35 gigabytes
of free space for user data.


605
00:29:48.487 --> 00:29:51.289 line:-1 position:50%
If I send the SharedDevice
ConfigurationSettings command


606
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:54.259 line:-1 position:50%
asking the device
to set ResidentUsers to three,


607
00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:59.164 line:-1 position:50%
it will compute each user's
quota to 11.67 gigabytes.


608
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,866 line:-1
Alternatively,
if I ask the device


609
00:30:00.866 --> 00:30:03.068 line:-1 position:50%
for a quota size
of 10 gigabytes,


610
00:30:03.068 --> 00:30:06.838 line:-1 position:50%
each user will have
a quota of 10 gigabytes.


611
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:09,574 line:-1
If we have three existing
users on the device


612
00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:11.710 line:-1 position:50%
and a fourth user
tries to log in,


613
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,746 line:-1
one of the existing user's data
will be removed from the device


614
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,349 line:-1
to create enough space
for the new user.


615
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,685 line:-1
In the QuotaSize example,
even though there was


616
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,820 line:-1
five gigabytes of free space
still available,


617
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.088 line:-1 position:50%
that would not meet
the requirement


618
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,157 line:-1
for the fourth user,
and therefore,


619
00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:28.593 line:-1 position:50%
one user still needs
to be removed.


620
00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:30.595 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at one more scenario
where we see


621
00:30:30.595 --> 00:30:33.432 line:-1 position:50%
how the number of users
can be adjusted on the device


622
00:30:33.432 --> 00:30:36.334 line:-1 position:50%
without changing the quota.


623
00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:37.636 line:-1 position:50%
When we started the scenario,


624
00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:40.338 line:-1 position:50%
we had 35 gigabytes
of free space.


625
00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:42.107 line:-1 position:50%
Well, it turns out that
25 gigabytes


626
00:30:42.107 --> 00:30:46.178 line:-1 position:50%
of the total space on the iPad
was taken up by apps and books.


627
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,746 line:-1
After doing a little research,


628
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,715 line:-1
I realized that there's
a few apps on this device


629
00:30:49.715 --> 00:30:52.384 line:-1 position:50%
that aren't being used
anymore.


630
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,286 line:-1
Now that I've trimmed down
my app library,


631
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:57,456 line:-1
my device has an additional
10 gigabytes of free space --


632
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:00,092 line:-1
meaning when our fourth user
comes to log in,


633
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,795 line:-1
it no longer requires
another user to be removed.


634
00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:07.165 line:-1 position:50%
Also, remember that
as of iOS 13.4,


635
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,701 line:-1
as long as there are no
cached users on the device,


636
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:13.171 line:-1 position:50%
quota sizes can be adjusted
at any time.


637
00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:15.107 line:-1 position:50%
Keeping these points in mind
should allow you to ensure


638
00:31:15.107 --> 00:31:19.778 line:-1 position:50%
the best possible experience for
your Shared iPad deployments.


639
00:31:19.778 --> 00:31:24.149 line:-1 position:50%
Let's wrap up our iOS and iPadOS
updates with some MDM protocol


640
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:28.019 line:-1 position:50%
and behavior changes
that you should be aware of.


641
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,389 line:-1
Apple devices come standard with
built-in accessibility features


642
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,325 line:-1
that let people
experience everything


643
00:31:33.325 --> 00:31:35.193 line:-1 position:50%
that their device has to offer.


644
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,596 line:-1
Traditionally, each user
needed to enable


645
00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:39.831 line:-1 position:50%
accessibility settings
themselves.


646
00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:44.102 line:-1 position:50%
But in iOS and iPadOS 16,
we're adding the ability for MDM


647
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:49,641 line:-1
to manage many of the most
popular accessibility settings.


648
00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:53.512 line:-1 position:50%
These features include
Text Size, VoiceOver, Zoom,


649
00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:56.181 line:-1 position:50%
Touch Accommodations,
Bold Text,


650
00:31:56.181 --> 00:31:58.683 line:-1 position:50%
Reduce Motion,
Increase Contrast,


651
00:31:58.683 --> 00:32:00.986 line:-1 position:50%
and Reduce Transparency.


652
00:32:00.986 --> 00:32:03.021 line:-1 position:50%
With all these options
available,


653
00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:05.357 line:-1 position:50%
we believe admins
can make devices in schools,


654
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:10,195 line:-1
restaurants, and hospitals
more accessible for all users.


655
00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:13.331 line:-1 position:50%
Be aware that these settings
are not locked after being set


656
00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:14.733 line:-1 position:50%
and a user is free
to modify them


657
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:17,569 line:-1
to match their own
unique preferences.


658
00:32:17.569 --> 00:32:19.671 line:-1 position:50%
The MDM server
can also query these settings


659
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,842 line:-1
with the DeviceInformation
query.


660
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:27,479 line:-1
Next, starting in
iOS and iPadOS 16,


661
00:32:27.479 --> 00:32:29.214 line:-1 position:50%
you'll now be able
to install applications


662
00:32:29.214 --> 00:32:31.183 line:-1 position:50%
during the
AwaitDeviceConfigured state


663
00:32:31.183 --> 00:32:33.585 line:-1 position:50%
during Automated
Device Enrollment.


664
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,554 line:-1
A few things to keep in mind.


665
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,355 line:-1
Is it is very likely
at this stage


666
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,891 line:-1
no user will be signed in
to the App Store,


667
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:43.328 line:-1 position:50%
so we recommend using
device-based app licenses.


668
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:46,731 line:-1
Unsupervised devices in Setup
will still return a NotNow


669
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,433 line:-1
until they reach
the Home screen.


670
00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:49.968 line:-1 position:50%
With this feature,
you can now ensure


671
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,804 line:-1
a device has everything a user
needs to get started


672
00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:56.608 line:-1 position:50%
before exiting Setup Assistant.


673
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,444 line:-1
As we continue to improve
the security of our devices,


674
00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:01.346 line:-1 position:50%
certain data types
become inaccessible


675
00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:03.048 line:-1 position:50%
before first unlock.


676
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:05,083 line:-1
Because of this,
the CertificateList query


677
00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:08.753 line:-1 position:50%
will start returning a NotNow
before first unlock.


678
00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:10.889 line:-1 position:50%
Once the user
unlocks the device,


679
00:33:10.889 --> 00:33:14.793 line:-1 position:50%
the query will respond as normal
until the device is rebooted.


680
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:17,195 line:-1
MDM developers,
please ensure that your servers


681
00:33:17.195 --> 00:33:22.234 line:-1 position:50%
are able to handle a NotNow
response for this query.


682
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:25,537 line:-1
And finally, we have an
exciting update for Apple TV.


683
00:33:25.537 --> 00:33:29.174 line:-1 position:50%
Starting in tvOS 16,
when you erase an Apple TV --


684
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,710 line:-1
either from Settings
or via MDM --


685
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.246 line:-1 position:50%
the remote will now
remained paired.


686
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:37,682 line:-1
Combined with Auto Advance,
this ensures that your Apple TVs


687
00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:41.853 line:-1 position:50%
are always refreshed
and ready to go.


688
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,155 line:-1
In addition to everything
that we've discussed today,


689
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,057 line:-1
there are even more changes
that you can check out


690
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:51,863 line:-1
in our documentation
at developer.apple.com.


691
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,200 line:-1
Speaking of documentation,
at a previous WWDC,


692
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.436 line:-1 position:50%
we brought the MDM documentation
to its new home.


693
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,038 line:-1
This change brought
more accurate


694
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,973 line:-1
and up-to-date documentation


695
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,209 line:-1
but also gave you the ability
to highlight changes


696
00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:06.444 line:-1 position:50%
in a particular OS release.


697
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:09,547 line:-1
The reception to this
documentation has been amazing


698
00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:11.883 line:-1 position:50%
and today I'm excited
to tell you that


699
00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:14.753 line:-1 position:50%
we are making the source code
that backs this documentation


700
00:34:14.753 --> 00:34:18.390 line:-1 position:50%
publicly available under
the MIT Open Source License


701
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,225 line:-1
in the new device
management project


702
00:34:20.225 --> 00:34:22.727 line:-1 position:50%
on Apple's GitHub page.


703
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,630 position:50%
Let's take a look at what
you'll find when you arrive.


704
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,065 position:50%
There will be two folders:


705
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,201 position:50%
one containing all
of the MDM documentation


706
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,569 position:50%
and one containing the new


707
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,905 line:0
declarative device
management documentation,


708
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:38,877 position:50%
as well as a README file
and our license information.


709
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:41,513 line:-1
Inside the MDM folder,
you'll find folders


710
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:44,382 line:-1
for checkin, commands,
and profiles.


711
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,850 line:-1
And for declarative management,


712
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:49.387 line:-1 position:50%
declarations, protocol,
and status.


713
00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:50.655 line:-1 position:50%
When you dive
into these folders,


714
00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:53.024 line:-1 position:50%
you'll find YAML files
for each command,


715
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,293 line:-1
profile,
or declaration.


716
00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:56.828 line:-1 position:50%
I'd like to highlight
a few items


717
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:00,031 line:-1
to get you familiar
with these files.


718
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,100 line:-1
First is the payload key.


719
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.170 line:-1 position:50%
This key shows the request type
for the MDM command.


720
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,605 line:-1
In this example,
that's ProfileList,


721
00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:09.507 line:-1 position:50%
which returns
a list of all profiles


722
00:35:09.507 --> 00:35:12.277 line:-1 position:50%
installed on the device.


723
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,079 line:-1
Next, supportedOS key


724
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,181 line:-1
gives you platform-specific
information


725
00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:18.583 line:-1 position:50%
like operating system
and version support,


726
00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:21.152 line:-1 position:50%
as well as things like
if it requires supervision


727
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,455 line:-1
or if it works
with user enrollment.


728
00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:30.128 line:-1 position:50%
Here we find the ProfileList key
was introduced in iOS 4.


729
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,730 position:50%
The payloadkeys
give you information


730
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,432 line:0
about additional features
the query offers.


731
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,902 position:50%
Each sub-key may include
an additional supportedOS key


732
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:41,039 position:50%
that will override the values
from the payload above.


733
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,175 line:0
The ProfileList query
was introduced in iOS 4,


734
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:48,213 position:50%
but the ManagedOnly feature
wasn't added until iOS 13.


735
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:51,316 line:0
The rest of the supportedOS
information remains the same,


736
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,151 position:50%
meaning supervision
is not required


737
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,821 position:50%
and the query works
for user enrollment.


738
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.623 line:-1 position:50%
In the case of
the ProfileList query,


739
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,226 line:-1
it returns a response
to the MDM server.


740
00:36:01.226 --> 00:36:04.429 line:-1 position:50%
The response keys
detail this information.


741
00:36:04.429 --> 00:36:07.298 line:-1 position:50%
In our example, we can expect
an array of dictionaries


742
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,568 line:-1
that describe
each profile installed.


743
00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:13.972 line:-1 position:50%
Inside that dictionary,
you will see key value pairs


744
00:36:13.972 --> 00:36:16.341 line:-1 position:50%
including things
like PayloadUUID


745
00:36:16.341 --> 00:36:18.376 line:-1 position:50%
and PayloadIdentifier.


746
00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:19.944 line:-1 position:50%
This is just a quick example


747
00:36:19.944 --> 00:36:21.913 line:-1 position:50%
and you will find
comprehensive details


748
00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:24.716 line:-1 position:50%
about the schema and the
structure of the repository


749
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,051 line:-1
in the README.


750
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:29,854 line:-1
Now let's talk about
some details.


751
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,989 line:-1
You will find data published


752
00:36:30.989 --> 00:36:35.360 line:-1 position:50%
back to the initial release
of iOS 15 and macOS Monterey.


753
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.496 line:-1 position:50%
From there, we publish
new branches for each release


754
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,866 line:-1
and seed as needed,
meaning that the iOS 16


755
00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:43.668 line:-1 position:50%
and macOS Ventura
documentation


756
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,271 line:-1
is up for you to check out
right now.


757
00:36:46.271 --> 00:36:48.706 line:-1 position:50%
We think that there are
a lot of exciting use cases


758
00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.809 line:-1 position:50%
for this new data
and we can't wait to see


759
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:54,546 line:-1
what new tools or integrations
you come up with!


760
00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:56.514 line:-1 position:50%
As you start to work
with this data,


761
00:36:56.514 --> 00:37:00.685 line:-1 position:50%
please use Feedback Assistant
to let us know how it's going.


762
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,887 line:-1
We've covered a ton
of information today,


763
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,323 line:-1
so let's take a moment to recap.


764
00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:07.292 line:-1 position:50%
Apple Configurator for iPhone


765
00:37:07.292 --> 00:37:10.261 line:-1 position:50%
now adds iPhone and iPad
to your organization,


766
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:14,032 line:-1
allowing you to more easily
manage and deploy devices.


767
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:16,701 line:-1
For identity,
Google Workspace integration,


768
00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:19.204 line:-1 position:50%
Enrollment SSO,
and Platform SSO


769
00:37:19.204 --> 00:37:22.373 line:-1 position:50%
bring a more cohesive
authentication experience.


770
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,510 line:-1
From there, Nadia told us about
how macOS Ventura


771
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,011 line:-1
gives you more information
to help you


772
00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:29.881 line:-1 position:50%
manage software updates
for your fleet.


773
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,150 line:-1
Automated Device Enrollment
