Hi, I'm Lynn,


5
00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.081 line:-1 position:50%
a design producer
for Siri and Shortcuts.


6
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.983 line:-1 position:50%
And today, I'm going
to tell you a bit more


7
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,317 line:-1
about the new App Intents
framework


8
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:21,154 line:-1
and how you can use it
to design great App Shortcuts.


9
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,757 line:-1
Here at Apple, we know
that people love using Siri


10
00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:27.160 line:-1 position:50%
and Spotlight to accelerate
common tasks across devices,


11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,595 line:-1
like this.


12
00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:31.832 line:-1 position:50%
Remind me to buy garlic.


13
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,737 line:-1
Set a timer for 20 minutes.


14
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.613 line:-1 position:50%
These habitual tasks
can be easily completed


15
00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:49.616 line:-1 position:50%
outside their respective apps,
and making them available


16
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,452 line:-1
via Siri and Spotlight
gives people flexibility


17
00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.221 line:-1 position:50%
in how they interact
with their device


18
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.857 line:-1 position:50%
and how they get things done.


19
00:00:56.857 --> 00:01:00.260 line:-1 position:50%
Shortcuts are how you can offer
people that same flexibility


20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,231 line:-1
to accomplish key tasks
from your app throughout the OS.


21
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.134 line:-1 position:50%
And all shortcuts begin
with a fundamental component


22
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:10,103 line:-1
called actions, which
represent an individual task


23
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,039 line:-1
that people can complete
with your app,


24
00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.109 line:-1 position:50%
such as creating a reminder
or sending a message.


25
00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.546 line:-1 position:50%
This foundation can be used
in a couple different ways.


26
00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.783 line:-1 position:50%
First, for custom shortcuts,
which people can create


27
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,818 line:-1
using one or more actions
from apps;


28
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,387 line:-1
that is, your app and others.


29
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,757 line:-1
Or an action can be used
to create an App Shortcut,


30
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,559 line:-1
created by
app developers like you,


31
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:35.128 line:-1 position:50%
containing one action
from your app.


32
00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:38.098 line:-1 position:50%
And while in the past,
people needed to find and tap


33
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,434 line:-1
the Add to Siri button
to enable each new app shortcut


34
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,304 line:-1
you created,
now, with iOS 16,


35
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,139 line:-1
the App Shortcuts
you create for your app


36
00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.776 line:-1 position:50%
will be automatically available
as soon as your app is installed.


37
00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.813 line:-1 position:50%
That means they'll be
available in Siri,


38
00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:54.548 line:-1 position:50%
visible in Spotlight,


39
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,216 line:-1
and featured
in the Shortcuts app,


40
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,185 line:-1
making it easier than ever
for people to access


41
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:02,389 line:-1
their favorite features
from your app throughout the OS.


42
00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.591 line:-1 position:50%
Today I'm going to walk through
a few different areas


43
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,394 line:-1
to help you create
unforgettable App Shortcuts.


44
00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:08.929 line:-1 position:50%
I'll start with how to select
the right features


45
00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.031 line:-1 position:50%
from your app
to turn into shortcuts,


46
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,699 line:-1
and how to name them.


47
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,801 line:-1
Then, I'll walk through
some best practices


48
00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.303 line:-1 position:50%
for presenting your visuals


49
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,638 line:-1
and for collecting
required information.


50
00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.108 line:-1 position:50%
And finally, I'll let you know
how you can tell people


51
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,943 line:-1
about your new shortcuts.


52
00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:25.545 line:-1 position:50%
So let's jump in.


53
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,848 line:-1
Now your app
has a wide range of features.


54
00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:29.449 line:-1 position:50%
But we know that some things
lend themselves


55
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,985 line:-1
better than others
to becoming great shortcuts.


56
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,887 line:-1
So what should you look for?


57
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,189 line:-1
Think about the features
people love in your app,


58
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,159 line:-1
and then focus on tasks
that are self-contained,


59
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.895 line:-1 position:50%
meaning they can be completed
outside your app;


60
00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.130 line:-1 position:50%
and straightforward,


61
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,432 line:-1
in that they're efficient
to get through.


62
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,401 line:-1
To give these principles
a bit more context,


63
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.603 line:-1 position:50%
let's take a look at
a sample meditation app.


64
00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:52.773 line:-1 position:50%
We'll just call it "Meditation."


65
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,641 line:-1
Now a great
App Shortcut is one


66
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.611 line:-1 position:50%
that actually doesn't require
your app in focus at all.


67
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,013 line:-1
You're looking for a lightweight
task that can be completed


68
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:04,217 line:-1
via Siri or via search
in its entirety.


69
00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:07.120 line:-1 position:50%
For our new Meditation app,
that'd be something like this.


70
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,025 line:-1
Start sleep meditation.


71
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.995 line:-1 position:50%
Voiceover: Take a deep breath,
close your eyes,


72
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,563 line:-1
and leave the day behind.


73
00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:22.035 line:-1 position:50%
It's easy to kick this off
without opening the app,


74
00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.271 line:-1 position:50%
and it just starts playing.


75
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,406 line:-1
You also want to make sure
the shortcuts you author


76
00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.774 line:-1 position:50%
are straightforward.


77
00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.810 line:-1 position:50%
They should feel effortless
to get through.


78
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.579 line:-1 position:50%
Tasks that require a lot
of input may be too tedious


79
00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.815 line:-1 position:50%
and time-consuming
for a shortcut.


80
00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:40.153 line:-1 position:50%
For example, a lengthy,
multistep survey like this one


81
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,490 line:-1
wouldn't be appropriate
for an App Shortcut.


82
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.326 line:-1 position:50%
Instead, focus on
uncomplicated tasks


83
00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.061 line:-1 position:50%
that people can succeed
at quickly,


84
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.864 line:-1 position:50%
and that they can remember even
when they're not using your app,


85
00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:52.799 line:-1 position:50%
like this.


86
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,778 line:-1
So the best features from
your app to turn into shortcuts


87
00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:07.481 line:-1 position:50%
are self-contained
and straightforward.


88
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.716 line:-1 position:50%
They can be completed
without the app in focus


89
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,018 line:-1
and are uncomplicated
to get through.


90
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,055 line:-1
And all in all, there may not
be so many of these.


91
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,291 line:-1
The maximum you can create
is 10, but in most cases,


92
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.093 line:-1 position:50%
the key features of your app
can be captured


93
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,963 line:-1
in two to five
high-quality app shortcuts,


94
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,631 line:-1
and we strongly recommend
keeping your set


95
00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:27.400 line:-1 position:50%
as focused as possible.


96
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,936 line:-1
Now, as important
as selecting the right features


97
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,439 line:-1
to become app shortcuts,
is authoring a great phrase


98
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,608 line:-1
to name them.


99
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,744 line:-1
This name is really the hero
phrase for your shortcut.


100
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,947 line:-1
It appears in the Shortcuts app
under your app's header,


101
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,683 line:-1
it's how your shortcut will be
referenced in Spotlight


102
00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:47.087 line:-1 position:50%
and it's what people will say
to Siri to invoke your shortcut.


103
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,055 line:-1
So where to start?


104
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,857 line:-1
The first important thing
to remember


105
00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:54.895 line:-1 position:50%
when you're crafting that hero
phrase is to keep it brief.


106
00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:56.029 line:-1 position:50%
You want your
app shortcut phrase


107
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,430 line:-1
to be easy to remember


108
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,667 line:-1
and to clearly communicate
its function.


109
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,537 line:-1
As a requirement, you'll need
to include your app name.


110
00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:05.505 line:-1 position:50%
But you can be
creative about it!


111
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,274 line:-1
See if you can incorporate
your app name


112
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,342 line:-1
directly into
the invocation phrase,


113
00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:12.112 line:-1 position:50%
like here with Voice Memo


114
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,614 line:-1
or here with Panera.


115
00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:17.717 line:-1 position:50%
And the app name in this phrase
can be your official app name


116
00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:21.221 line:-1 position:50%
or any of the alternative names
you submitted to the App Store.


117
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,990 line:-1
In this case, Panera Bread
is the official app name,


118
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.460 line:-1 position:50%
but the Panera synonym feels
more natural in the phrase.


119
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.665 line:-1 position:50%
And here's how that could look
with our app, Meditation.


120
00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:35.135 line:-1 position:50%
Let's dig a little deeper
with the Voice Memo example.


121
00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:38.905 line:-1 position:50%
I'll turn on my transcriptions
so we can see my speech.


122
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,241 line:-1
Remember that the name
you choose for your App Shortcut


123
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:44,244 line:-1
is also what people will say to
Siri to invoke it, and you need


124
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,546 line:-1
to provide thoughtful
natural language variations


125
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,715 line:-1
to ensure it works
for whatever similar phrases


126
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,250 line:-1
people might say.


127
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,454 line:-1
For example, for this shortcut,
named Record Voice Memo,


128
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,756 line:-1
I would need
to explicitly specify


129
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,227 line:-1
"Start Voice Memo"
and "New Voice Memo"


130
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,930 line:-1
as synonyms,
otherwise they won't work.


131
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,732 line:-1
Be sufficiently thorough here.


132
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,134 line:-1
You want to try to capture
all the alternative phrases


133
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,869 line:-1
people might say.


134
00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.539 line:-1 position:50%
But -- and this is
a bit of a judgment call --


135
00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.841 line:-1 position:50%
make sure you're not straying
too far from the core purpose


136
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:16.876 line:-1 position:50%
of your shortcut
and entering into a new meaning


137
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,178 line:-1
with these phrases.


138
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,948 line:0
In this case, the intent is
truly to create not to save.


139
00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:25.151 line:-1 position:50%
And remember, you will have
to go through this exercise


140
00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.621 line:-1 position:50%
of providing thorough synonyms
for every language


141
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,156 line:-1
that your app is published
to ensure a robust experience


142
00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:31.891 line:-1 position:50%
around the world.


143
00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:35.929 line:-1 position:50%
So I've talked about
the importance


144
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,765 line:-1
of keeping your app shortcut
name brief and memorable,


145
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,534 line:-1
creative strategies
for incorporating your app name,


146
00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:43.436 line:-1 position:50%
and the value of generating
thorough synonyms


147
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,640 line:-1
and translating those synonyms
to other languages.


148
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,941 line:-1
The last thing
I want to talk about


149
00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:49.643 line:-1 position:50%
when it comes
to naming your shortcut


150
00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:52.879 line:-1 position:50%
is how and when to use
a dynamic parameter.


151
00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.781 line:-1 position:50%
You can now use
a dynamic parameter


152
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,549 line:-1
directly in the name
of your shortcut


153
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,551 line:-1
to create multiple variations
on the phrase


154
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,688 line:-1
that people can say to Siri
or see in Spotlight.


155
00:07:01.688 --> 00:07:03.790 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a look at an example.


156
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,293 line:-1
So for our Meditation app,
the dynamic parameter


157
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,728 line:-1
could be different types
of meditation.


158
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,930 line:-1
And you can see how
this provides the flexibility


159
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.234 line:-1 position:50%
to directly ask
for those different types.


160
00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:16.970 line:-1 position:50%
But there are a couple things
to note about this parameter.


161
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.839 line:-1 position:50%
First, you can only have
one dynamic parameter


162
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,275 line:-1
in your phrase,
and it can only be used


163
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,978 line:-1
to select from a finite list.


164
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,946 line:-1
You want to make sure
that other values in the list


165
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,482 line:-1
are predictable since people
won't have this list of options


166
00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.618 line:-1 position:50%
in front of them for reference.


167
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,254 line:0
This is a good example because
people are likely familiar


168
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,956 line:0
with the different meditation
types from using the app,


169
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,992 line:0
and it's also a small list.


170
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,261 line:0
Other good examples
might be recent restaurants


171
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:45,332 position:50%
that are front of mind or
different rooms in the home.


172
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:48,068 line:-1
A bad example would be
something with infinite options,


173
00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:49.703 line:-1 position:50%
like a time value.


174
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,805 line:0
You don't want to use
a dynamic parameter here,


175
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,807 line:0
but instead, prompt
for additional information


176
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,041 line:0
as needed.


177
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,677 position:50%
I'll talk more
about that in a bit.


178
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,546 line:-1
Last thing to note
is that this list


179
00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:02.515 line:-1 position:50%
of possible parameter values
can be updated any time


180
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,651 line:-1
your app is open,
so you can ensure


181
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:08.988 line:-1 position:50%
it consistently contains
up-to-date and relevant values.


182
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,257 line:-1
Now, each parameter value,


183
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,360 line:-1
in combination
with the App Intent,


184
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.596 line:-1 position:50%
creates a unique variant
of your app shortcut.


185
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,298 position:50%
So for starting a meditation,


186
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,867 line:0
you'd have this
unparameterized version


187
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,138 position:50%
and each parameterized version,
like Start Sleep Meditation,


188
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,908 position:50%
Start Gratitude Meditation,
and all the others.


189
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,477 line:0
These are automatically
generated


190
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:34,114 line:0
and displayed in the Shortcuts
app, as you see here,


191
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,684 line:0
and shown as individual rows
in Spotlight.


192
00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.153 line:-1 position:50%
These parameters are also
visible in the Shortcuts editor


193
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,490 line:-1
when you provide a parameter
summary for your action.


194
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,058 line:-1
When someone taps
on the parameter,


195
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,228 line:-1
your options will appear
in a menu like this.


196
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,230 line:0
To learn more about actions
and how they appear


197
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,364 position:50%
in the Shortcuts editor,


198
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,000 line:0
check out this talk from last
year on designing great actions


199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,437 line:0
for Shortcuts, Siri,
and Suggestions.


200
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,339 line:-1
The last important consideration
when it comes


201
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,342 line:-1
to including a dynamic parameter
is making sure it's clear


202
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,044 line:-1
which part of the phrase
is a parameter.


203
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,914 line:-1
As I mentioned, you can only
have one dynamic parameter


204
00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:11.484 line:-1 position:50%
per app shortcut, but if you had
this as your app shortcut,


205
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,788 line:-1
the second part of
the phrase -- "nature sounds" --


206
00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:17.590 line:-1 position:50%
seems like a second parameter
that can be changed.


207
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,726 line:-1
This could make people
think they can say


208
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,429 line:-1
"gratitude meditation
with ocean sounds,"


209
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,063 line:-1
when in fact, only
the first part of the phrase


210
00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.632 line:-1 position:50%
can be changed.


211
00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:28.501 line:-1 position:50%
The solution here
is to keep it simple.


212
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:31.037 line:-1 position:50%
If it feels too complicated
when you say it aloud,


213
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,772 line:-1
it probably is.


214
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,007 line:-1
And if that additional
information


215
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,375 line:-1
is absolutely required,


216
00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:37.310 line:-1 position:50%
you can ask for it
in a subsequent step,


217
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.047 line:-1 position:50%
and I'll provide some tips
on how to do that later.


218
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,582 line:-1
Looking back at everything
I mentioned


219
00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.385 line:-1 position:50%
about selecting features,
naming your shortcut,


220
00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:48.555 line:-1 position:50%
and using dynamic parameters,
one theme stands out,


221
00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:50.623 line:-1 position:50%
and that's to make it memorable.


222
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,959 line:-1
Within your app,
people can explore,


223
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,929 line:-1
get drawn into features,
and learn new flows.


224
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,864 line:-1
But with shortcuts,
your main goal is to create


225
00:09:57.864 --> 00:10:01.334 line:-1 position:50%
a few focused experiences
that people can quickly learn,


226
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,404 line:-1
remember,
and grow to depend on.


227
00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:06.206 line:-1 position:50%
Now let's take a look at
some visual considerations


228
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,908 line:-1
for your app shortcuts.


229
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,944 line:-1
Custom Snippets
and Live Activities


230
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,646 line:-1
provide you with an opportunity
to present information,


231
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,749 line:-1
request clarifications,
and surface your app identity,


232
00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:18.985 line:-1 position:50%
and I want to share some tips
for making them as beautiful


233
00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.521 line:-1 position:50%
and effective as possible.


234
00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:24.991 line:-1 position:50%
Unlike most of your apps that
likely use opaque backgrounds,


235
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,827 line:-1
snippets use
a semitranslucent material.


236
00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:30.463 line:-1 position:50%
Place elements from your app
on top of this material


237
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,399 line:-1
instead of filling the visual
with an opaque background.


238
00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.168 line:-1 position:50%
You can see an example here,
with elements


239
00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:37.036 line:-1 position:50%
from the Weather app
integrating seamlessly


240
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,706 line:-1
into the Siri snippet.


241
00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:42.242 line:-1 position:50%
And when you draw your text,
use vibrant label colors


242
00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:45.678 line:-1 position:50%
to guarantee great contrast
over the translucent background.


243
00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:47.146 line:-1 position:50%
Doing this ensures
that your text


244
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,950 line:-1
will automatically look great
in Dark Mode too.


245
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.987 line:-1 position:50%
Now there are two ways
to show results in iOS 16:


246
00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.956 line:-1 position:50%
Live Activities
and Custom Snippets.


247
00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:58.691 line:-1 position:50%
If you're not sure
which one to use,


248
00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:00.093 line:-1 position:50%
think about whether
people would benefit


249
00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:02.562 line:-1 position:50%
from continuous access
to this information,


250
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,664 line:-1
such as transit progress
for a food order


251
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,533 line:-1
or a timer counting down.


252
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,202 line:-1
If so, use a Live Activity.


253
00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:11.437 line:-1 position:50%
This will make the content
continuously glanceable,


254
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,507 line:-1
even on the Lock Screen,
until the event has ended.


255
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,343 line:-1
If not, and the shortcut
is a self-contained action


256
00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:21.447 line:-1 position:50%
or piece of information,
use a Custom Snippet.


257
00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.449 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a closer look
at the iOS snippet


258
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,785 line:-1
and a couple
of the key elements it contains.


259
00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:28.488 line:-1 position:50%
Here, you see
the supporting dialog.


260
00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:29.856 line:-1 position:50%
This is what Siri speaks


261
00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:33.793 line:-1 position:50%
and is intended to accompany
your custom visual.


262
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,963 line:-1
Together, they communicate
all the necessary information


263
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,165 line:-1
for this step of the shortcut.


264
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,101 line:-1
Now by default, your custom
visual will consistently appear


265
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,903 line:-1
with supporting dialog.


266
00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:46.706 line:-1 position:50%
But in this example, you can
see that the supporting dialog


267
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,676 line:-1
is fully redundant
with your visual response.


268
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,945 line:-1
When that's the case,
you should suppress this dialog


269
00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:56.149 line:-1 position:50%
in your source code
so that it won't be shown.


270
00:11:56.149 --> 00:11:59.552 line:-1 position:50%
But the presentation of your
information goes beyond iOS,


271
00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.854 line:-1 position:50%
and you'll need to think about
other devices in the ecosystem


272
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,456 line:-1
as well.


273
00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:06.125 line:-1 position:50%
For voice-only products,
like AirPods,


274
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,362 line:-1
Siri will read out
the full dialog you provide.


275
00:12:09.362 --> 00:12:10.697 line:-1 position:50%
For these platforms,
it's important


276
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:14,200 line:-1
that your full dialog contain
all the critical information


277
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.870 line:-1 position:50%
from both your custom visual
and any supporting dialog.


278
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.772 line:-1 position:50%
Be sure to provide
both types of dialog,


279
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,308 line:-1
so that people have access
to all the information they need


280
00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:23.943 line:-1 position:50%
regardless of which device
they choose


281
00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:26.846 line:-1 position:50%
to interact with your shortcut.


282
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,081 line:-1
And for the first time,


283
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.084 line:-1 position:50%
Apple Watch now supports
Custom Snippets as well.


284
00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.952 line:-1 position:50%
This means you should take
a look at your shortcuts


285
00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:35.288 line:-1 position:50%
in watchOS 9
and make sure they look great


286
00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:37.390 line:-1 position:50%
on that platform as well.


287
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,325 line:-1
And know that this may
require you to make changes


288
00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:40.493 line:-1 position:50%
to your layout.


289
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,128 line:-1
Here you can see
how the Coffee app


290
00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:44.497 line:-1 position:50%
repositioned the address line
on watchOS


291
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,768 line:-1
to fall beneath the header
to help with readability.


292
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,571 line:-1
Just to recap
these first few visual tips.


293
00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:53.072 line:-1 position:50%
I walked through how
to integrate elements


294
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,942 line:-1
from your app into
the translucent background,


295
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,478 line:-1
the importance of using
vibrant label colors,


296
00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:01.447 line:-1 position:50%
the appropriate time to use
snippets versus live activities,


297
00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.316 line:-1 position:50%
and how to adapt
your dialog and visuals


298
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,319 line:-1
for different platforms
and contexts.


299
00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:08.421 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let's talk about Spotlight.


300
00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:12.992 line:-1 position:50%
In iOS 16, your app's shortcuts
will also appear in Spotlight.


301
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,462 line:-1
If someone searches for your
app name, one app shortcut --


302
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.831 line:-1 position:50%
the first one in
your App Shortcuts array --


303
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:23,436 line:-1
will appear as a Siri Suggestion
below your app as a top hit.


304
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,872 line:-1
They can also search directly
for the name of the shortcut,


305
00:13:25.872 --> 00:13:28.074 line:-1 position:50%
and any app shortcut
that matches the search term


306
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,109 line:-1
will appear.


307
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,478 line:-1
Finally, if your app
is a Siri Suggestion


308
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,347 line:-1
when someone
first launches Spotlight,


309
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,582 line:-1
your top shortcut
will also appear here,


310
00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:39.986 line:-1 position:50%
even before anything has been
typed into the search field.


311
00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.821 line:-1 position:50%
This is all really exciting,
because it provides


312
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.457 line:-1 position:50%
an opportunity for people
to learn about your shortcuts


313
00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:47.760 line:-1 position:50%
just by looking for your app
or by using their phone.


314
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,229 line:-1
You'll also notice
that each unique app shortcut


315
00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:53.332 line:-1 position:50%
is decorated with a symbol
on the right side.


316
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,468 line:-1
Be sure to review
the SF Symbols library


317
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,704 line:-1
and select one for each
of your app shortcuts


318
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,174 line:-1
that accurately reflects
its intent.


319
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:05,078 line:-1
Also, know that the order of
your actions and your parameters


320
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,146 line:-1
will influence the order
your app shortcuts appear


321
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,948 line:-1
in Spotlight.


322
00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:11.517 line:-1 position:50%
Actions can only be reordered
with app updates,


323
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,986 line:-1
but as I mentioned earlier,
the order of your parameters


324
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,055 line:-1
is truly dynamic
and can be updated


325
00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.291 line:-1 position:50%
any time your app is open.


326
00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:21.627 line:-1 position:50%
This in turn impacts
how your shortcuts are shown.


327
00:14:21.627 --> 00:14:24.697 line:-1 position:50%
Here, you see that
Reorder Coffee App Cappuccino


328
00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.900 line:-1 position:50%
is first in the Shortcuts app
and takes the single slot


329
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,869 line:-1
in Spotlight.


330
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,739 position:50%
But maybe this customer ordered
a chai latte more recently,


331
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,341 position:50%
and you want that to be
your suggestion in Spotlight.


332
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:38,277 line:0
You can make it the first item
returned by your entity query


333
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,047 position:50%
or dynamic options provider,
and it will become first


334
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,717 position:50%
in the Shortcuts app
and in Spotlight.


335
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,019 line:0
And as the number
of parameters increases,


336
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,323 line:0
this prioritization may become
even more important.


337
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,158 position:50%
But be sure to pick
a meaningful heuristic --


338
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,294 position:50%
such as recency or frequency --
to drive the order,


339
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,998 line:0
so that it doesn't feel
random or unpredictable.


340
00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:01.868 line:-1 position:50%
And one last thing --
pick a color for your shortcuts


341
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,603 line:-1
in the Shortcuts app.


342
00:15:03.603 --> 00:15:05.838 line:-1 position:50%
We have a bunch of great colors
for you to choose from,


343
00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.474 line:-1 position:50%
and all your shortcuts will use
this color in the app.


344
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,877 line:-1
So pick one that complements
your app icon nicely


345
00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:13.780 line:-1 position:50%
and don't just stick
with the default.


346
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,683 line:-1
Now, as quick and contained
as your shortcuts aspire to be,


347
00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:18.918 line:-1 position:50%
there may still be times
when you need


348
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:22.288 line:-1 position:50%
to collect some information
in order to see a task though.


349
00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:24.490 line:-1 position:50%
I'm going to walk through
a few different ways to do that


350
00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.959 line:-1 position:50%
and when to use each one.


351
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,396 line:-1
Take a phrase like this one that
doesn't contain a parameter.


352
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,465 line:-1
Sometimes, you can make
an informed decision


353
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,802 line:-1
and assume a value and
then proceed with the action.


354
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:36,702 position:50%
One example here


355
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,906 position:50%
might be starting a meditation
that was already in progress.


356
00:15:39.906 --> 00:15:42.675 line:-1 position:50%
But other times, in the face
of an ambiguous request,


357
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,611 line:-1
you'll need to ask
for more information.


358
00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:48.447 line:-1 position:50%
When possible, try to make
a meaningful assumption


359
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,651 line:-1
and present it as an option
for people to confirm.


360
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:54.487 line:-1 position:50%
This is called
a Parameter Confirmation.


361
00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:57.857 line:-1 position:50%
These assumptions could be based
on remembering a prior selection


362
00:15:57.857 --> 00:16:00.660 line:-1 position:50%
or based on something
like the most popular option.


363
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,262 line:-1
Parameter Confirmations
are a nice, efficient way


364
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:07,400 line:-1
to be sure you have the detail
you need and continue on.


365
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,435 line:-1
But let's say the person has
never gone through this shortcut


366
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:13,105 line:-1
before and you don't have
a single parameter to offer.


367
00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:16.042 line:-1 position:50%
Another option is
to provide a short list.


368
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,711 line:-1
This is called a disambiguation
and helps people


369
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.446 line:-1 position:50%
that are unfamiliar
with the shortcut


370
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,448 line:-1
learn the possible values.


371
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,550 line:-1
Just keep in mind
that this is best for lists


372
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.552 line:-1 position:50%
of five values or less,


373
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,722 line:-1
because in voice-only
modalities, such as AirPods,


374
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,892 line:-1
Siri will read
this entire list aloud.


375
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,360 line:-1
What kind of meditation?


376
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:40.199 line:-1 position:50%
Focus, Gratitude, Walking,
Compassion, or Sleep?


377
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,735 line:-1
Sometimes, you need
to collect an open-ended value


378
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,871 line:-1
that isn't compatible
with a short list,


379
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:48,074 line:-1
like a number, a location,
or a string.


380
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:51,844 line:0
In these situations, you can
use an open-ended request.


381
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,512 position:50%
This has the fewest
guardrails though,


382
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,248 line:0
since there are
no suggested values


383
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,550 line:0
and people can say
anything in response,


384
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,452 position:50%
so make sure it's clear
what type of information


385
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,020 line:0
your app is expecting.


386
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,021 line:0
In this case,


387
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,558 line:0
it's apparent that the response
should be a time value.


388
00:17:05.558 --> 00:17:08.261 line:-1 position:50%
The App Intent framework does
provide a set of common options


389
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:12,198 line:-1
for these open-ended requests,
such as numerical values,


390
00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:15.234 line:-1 position:50%
dates, or time values.


391
00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:17.670 line:-1 position:50%
If your required parameter
aligns with one of these,


392
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,472 line:-1
definitely select it.


393
00:17:19.472 --> 00:17:22.008 line:-1 position:50%
This will allow you to benefit
from certain built-in dialog


394
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,342 line:-1
and visual patterns,


395
00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:25.211 line:-1 position:50%
as well as Siri's natural
language understanding


396
00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.980 line:-1 position:50%
as it pertains to these types
of information.


397
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,083 line:0
If not, you can use
a custom entity.


398
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,819 line:0
For more information on how
to implement app entities,


399
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,690 position:50%
check out this year's talk
called "Dive into App Intents."


400
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.027 line:-1 position:50%
Lastly, even if you have all
the information you require,


401
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,496 line:-1
you may still want to do
one final confirmation --


402
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,564 line:-1
what we call
an "intent confirmation" --


403
00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:48.100 line:-1 position:50%
before proceeding
with your shortcut.


404
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.169 line:-1 position:50%
The guidance here is
to only use this step


405
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,906 line:-1
for consequential actions,
be it a financial transaction,


406
00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.275 line:-1 position:50%
a destructive action
like deleting content,


407
00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:58.277 line:-1 position:50%
or an action that may
just feel high risk,


408
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,180 line:-1
like sending a calendar invite
to a big group.


409
00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.783 line:-1 position:50%
Use these appropriately
but sparingly,


410
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,152 line:-1
as the goal of getting through a
shortcut as quickly as possible


411
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,654 line:-1
always applies.


412
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,756 line:-1
One last detail
on intent confirmations


413
00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:13.592 line:-1 position:50%
is that they will always have a
pair of buttons in the snippet,


414
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,128 line:-1
offering to either
proceed with -- or cancel --


415
00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:17.930 line:-1 position:50%
the proposed action.


416
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.333 line:-1 position:50%
When confirming an intent,
buttons should contain a verb


417
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,868 line:-1
reiterating the action
that is about to be taken


418
00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:26.672 line:-1 position:50%
and not ambiguous words
like "confirm."


419
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,175 line:-1
The App Intents framework
provides a really helpful set


420
00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:32.078 line:-1 position:50%
of default verbs
with corresponding synonyms.


421
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,447 line:-1
You can see
a few examples here.


422
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,950 line:-1
If your intent maps to one
of these, go ahead and use it.


423
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,020 line:0
If you have a specific intent
that falls outside this group,


424
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,189 line:0
you can provide
a custom string instead


425
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,890 line:0
but be sure to provide
synonyms as well


426
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,194 position:50%
so that Siri understands
all the similar phrases.


427
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,229 line:-1
Last but not least,
once you've created


428
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,698 line:-1
an awesome set of app shortcuts,
there are a few places


429
00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:56.035 line:-1 position:50%
to surface them
for people to discover.


430
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,537 position:50%
First, in place of the old
Add to Siri button


431
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,173 position:50%
is a new tip for you
to feature in your app.


432
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,142 line:0
It's important that
you carefully select moments


433
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,511 line:0
within your app to surface
these tips, at a time


434
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,080 line:0
when people are likely
to benefit from the education,


435
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,217 line:0
such as immediately before
or after completing an action


436
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,619 position:50%
that they may want to repeat
in the future.


437
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,989 line:0
And where appropriate,
make your tip dismissible.


438
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,325 line:0
Respect people's desire to
remove this helpful information


439
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,061 position:50%
from their workflow.


440
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,897 position:50%
We've also provided a button
that you can place in your app


441
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,800 position:50%
to link to the Shortcuts app
directly to the landing page


442
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,770 line:0
that lists all
your app shortcuts.


443
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,438 line:-1
It's an exciting year
for shortcuts,


444
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,573 line:-1
with the introduction
of App Shortcuts,


445
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,176 line:-1
created by you,
and seamlessly available


446
00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:41.647 line:-1 position:50%
in Siri, Shortcuts,
and Spotlight.


447
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,083 line:-1
With dynamic parameters
in the invocation phrase,


448
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,553 line:-1
Custom Snippets on watchOS,
new tips, and more,


449
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,889 line:-1
there's a lot to explore.


450
00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:51.624 line:-1 position:50%
And with all the info
I walked through today


451
00:19:51.624 --> 00:19:53.959 line:-1 position:50%
on selecting and naming
great app shortcuts,


452
00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:55.961 line:-1 position:50%
refining your presentation
and flow,


453
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,863 line:-1
and including tips
for discoverability,


454
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,864 line:-1
you're well on your way


455
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,100 line:-1
to an amazing
App Shortcuts experience.


456
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,601 line:-1
We can't wait to see
what you create,


457
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,703 line:-1
and have a great
rest of WWDC.
