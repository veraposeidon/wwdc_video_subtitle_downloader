Welcome to "Qualities of
great AR experiences."


5
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,282 line:-1
I'm Alli Dryer, and I'm part of
the Apple Design team


6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:18,485 line:-1
working on augmented reality.


7
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,688 line:-1
AR lets you deliver experiences
that blend virtual objects


8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,956 line:-1
with the real world,


9
00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:26.526 line:-1 position:50%
creating the illusion that
these objects actually exist.


10
00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.629 line:-1 position:50%
AR can be
surprisingly immersive,


11
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,097 line:-1
and yet at the same time,


12
00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:33.267 line:-1 position:50%
it's always grounded
in what's really happening.


13
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,735 line:-1
It allows you
to visualize things


14
00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:37.204 line:-1 position:50%
that would be impossible,
risky, or hard to do


15
00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:39.640 line:-1 position:50%
from a practical standpoint.


16
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.175 line:-1 position:50%
Blurring the line between
imagination and reality,


17
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,345 line:-1
an AR experience
really feels like magic.


18
00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.547 line:-1 position:50%
You can completely transform
people's surroundings


19
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,084 line:-1
through visuals and sound so
they experience something new.


20
00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:54.087 line:-1 position:50%
You can also add new layers of
information to the environment


21
00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:57.724 line:-1 position:50%
to enable quick and lightweight
interactions.


22
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,494 line:-1
Designing for augmented reality
can be very different


23
00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:02.596 line:-1 position:50%
from designing
for 2D applications,


24
00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.998 line:-1 position:50%
but don't worry,
we'll break it down here.


25
00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.035 line:-1 position:50%
Today I'm going to share
criteria you can use


26
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:11,238 line:-1
to decide if AR is right for
the experience you're building,


27
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,207 line:-1
along with tips for handling
some of the unique aspects


28
00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.209 line:-1 position:50%
of augmented reality
when you're designing


29
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,912 line:-1
your first AR experience.


30
00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.315 line:-1 position:50%
OK. So you're designing
an app or feature


31
00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:24.017 line:-1 position:50%
and wondering whether AR
makes sense for you.


32
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,219 line:-1
Here are a few things
to consider.


33
00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.856 line:-1 position:50%
AR can help you deliver
a true representation of things.


34
00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.091 line:-1 position:50%
To show what I mean,


35
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,361 line:-1
let's look at an example of
something AR does really well,


36
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:37.230 line:-1 position:50%
which is to present the
real-world size of an object.


37
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,865 line:-1
Say you're trying
to educate people


38
00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.168 line:-1 position:50%
about how big a dinosaur is.


39
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,171 line:-1
You could just write it out,


40
00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:47.574 line:-1 position:50%
or show a picture,


41
00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:51.411 line:-1 position:50%
or you could unleash
a virtual T. rex on the scene.


42
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,447 line:-1
In that case,
there's no need to imagine


43
00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:55.282 line:-1 position:50%
how big the dinosaur is.


44
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.050 line:-1 position:50%
The AR experience
gives the viewer


45
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.353 line:-1 position:50%
an instant,
visceral sense of scale


46
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,655 line:-1
in a way that's
truly immersive.


47
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,091 line:-1
This example comes
from the app Monster Park,


48
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:06.493 line:-1 position:50%
a game that lets people
explore and control


49
00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:09.896 line:-1 position:50%
the movement of animated
three-dimensional dinosaurs.


50
00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:11.398 line:-1 position:50%
It's fitting that the entire app


51
00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:14.501 line:-1 position:50%
revolves around this
large-as-life AR experience,


52
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:20,007 line:-1
also emphasizing the creation of
photos and videos for sharing.


53
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:23.176 line:-1 position:50%
AR is at its most delightful
when it affects and responds


54
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,312 line:-1
to what's immediately
around you,


55
00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:28.415 line:-1 position:50%
involving physical space
in a meaningful way.


56
00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:30.017 line:-1 position:50%
Say you're trying
to design an app


57
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,919 line:-1
that helps with interior design,
and you want to help people


58
00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.122 line:-1 position:50%
choose a paint color
for their walls.


59
00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:38.425 line:-1 position:50%
You could use swatches
or stock photography,


60
00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.327 line:-1 position:50%
but those aren't very accurate.


61
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,095 line:-1
Even better,
you could show someone


62
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,864 line:-1
how their very own
room would look


63
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,166 line:-1
with freshly painted walls.


64
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,435 line:-1
The Color Snap app
does just that.


65
00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:50.303 line:-1 position:50%
It allows people
to choose a paint color


66
00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:52.973 line:-1 position:50%
and then tap a wall
to preview the effect.


67
00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:55.308 line:-1 position:50%
Because it's AR,
people can move around


68
00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.444 line:-1 position:50%
to see how the new color
will affect their space


69
00:02:57.444 --> 00:02:59.312 line:-1 position:50%
from different vantage points.


70
00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:02.983 line:-1 position:50%
Next, augmented reality
allows you to create experiences


71
00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:05.919 line:-1 position:50%
that visualize
virtual objects in 3D,


72
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,256 line:-1
which makes it easier
to understand and evaluate them.


73
00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:12.793 line:-1 position:50%
With AR, you can build features
that help people try on things


74
00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:15.128 line:-1 position:50%
in a way that's virtual
yet realistic enough


75
00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:18.165 line:-1 position:50%
for someone to make
a confident purchasing decision.


76
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,067 line:-1
For example,
the Warby Parker app


77
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,235 line:-1
lets people try on
virtual glasses


78
00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.004 line:-1 position:50%
so they can place an order
knowing exactly


79
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,605 line:-1
how their frames will fit.


80
00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:28.175 line:-1 position:50%
It's faster to switch between
frame styles in AR


81
00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:31.144 line:-1 position:50%
than it would be
to swap glasses in real life.


82
00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.946 line:-1 position:50%
Grounding virtual objects
in the scene


83
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,948 line:-1
is also really important.


84
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,951 line:-1
The quality of lighting
and shadows in your experiences


85
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.454 line:-1 position:50%
can have a huge impact
on people's feeling


86
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,055 line:-1
that things are really there,


87
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.958 line:-1 position:50%
even when an object
isn't very realistic.


88
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,094 line:-1
The IKEA Place app
allows people to place


89
00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:49.429 line:-1 position:50%
a piece of virtual furniture
in their home


90
00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:50.530 line:-1 position:50%
and get a more accurate sense


91
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,599 line:-1
of what the updated room
would look like.


92
00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.535 line:-1 position:50%
IKEA Place takes advantage of
ARKit's built-in lighting


93
00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.904 line:-1 position:50%
for realistic shadows
that really settle


94
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,874 line:-1
the virtual furniture
into the room.


95
00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:03.143 line:-1 position:50%
Visualizing in 3D
can refer to objects,


96
00:04:03.143 --> 00:04:05.345 line:-1 position:50%
but don't forget about
using people's surroundings


97
00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:08.482 line:-1 position:50%
as a canvas
for your experiences.


98
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,418 line:-1
You can create new features
with advanced visual effects,


99
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,254 line:-1
provide maps and 3D models
that fit your brand,


100
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,157 line:-1
and even bring people's spaces
into the game you're building


101
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:20,393 line:-1
with iOS's new RoomPlan API.


102
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,696 position:50%
We've got a session
on creating 3D room scans


103
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,397 line:0
that goes into detail
about RoomPlan


104
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,399 line:0
if you want to learn more.


105
00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:28.535 line:-1 position:50%
AR lets you streamline actions


106
00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:31.638 line:-1 position:50%
by attaching digital
capabilities to physical things,


107
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,407 line:-1
making your apps and features
more efficient.


108
00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:35.775 line:-1 position:50%
You might have
already experienced


109
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,678 line:-1
how using the real world
as input can speed things up


110
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,482 line:-1
if you've ever scanned a code
to order at a restaurant.


111
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,919 line:-1
You can use AR to build compact
yet incredibly useful features


112
00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.721 line:-1 position:50%
that save people time.


113
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,024 line:-1
In iOS's Measure App,
centering the camera on a person


114
00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:54.594 line:-1 position:50%
automatically displays her
height in just the right spot.


115
00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:58.231 line:-1 position:50%
The experience feels lightweight
because there's very little UI,


116
00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:00.567 line:-1 position:50%
the interaction is based
on device movement,


117
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,671 line:-1
and the measurement information
disappears after you've seen it.


118
00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:07.507 line:-1 position:50%
This AR experience
would be too limited to offer


119
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,210 line:-1
as an app on its own,
but it really complements


120
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.280 line:-1 position:50%
the other capabilities
of the Measure app.


121
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.683 line:-1 position:50%
So, now you know you can use
AR for your apps and features


122
00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:19.519 line:-1 position:50%
when you want to deliver
a true representation,


123
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,322 line:-1
involve physical space
in a meaningful way,


124
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,925 line:-1
visualize in 3D,
and streamline actions


125
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,961 line:-1
by making use of what's in
the environment.


126
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:30.664 line:-1 position:50%
And as you can see, there are
a lot of different ways


127
00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.967 line:-1 position:50%
to incorporate AR into
the experiences you're creating,


128
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,036 line:-1
whether it's as
the main focus of the app


129
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,573 line:-1
or with a lighter hand as
a feature that reduces friction.


130
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,809 line:-1
So, you've decided AR
is right for your purposes


131
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,845 line:-1
and now it's time
to get started with design.


132
00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.414 line:-1 position:50%
When you're designing for AR,


133
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,482 line:-1
you'll need to consider
some of the aspects


134
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,286 line:-1
that make it different
than traditional 2D interfaces.


135
00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:57.023 line:-1 position:50%
AR is spatial.


136
00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:00.894 line:-1 position:50%
AR is movement-based.


137
00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:05.265 line:-1 position:50%
And AR is tied
to the physical environment.


138
00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:07.968 line:-1 position:50%
You'll need to think about
how to blend virtual elements


139
00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:10.470 line:-1 position:50%
into the scene,
about ergonomics,


140
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.473 line:-1 position:50%
and about working
with a limited field of view.


141
00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.475 line:-1 position:50%
Now I'll go through tips
you can keep in mind


142
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,712 line:-1
when designing AR experiences.


143
00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.814 line:-1 position:50%
People using your app
might be in places


144
00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:22.649 line:-1 position:50%
that are difficult for AR,


145
00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:24.651 line:-1 position:50%
so what you can do
to help is coach them


146
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.721 line:-1 position:50%
through different ways
to get to a better experience.


147
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,823 line:-1
The Mission to Mars app
does a great job


148
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,691 line:-1
of getting people
set up for success


149
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,727 line:-1
with a strong coaching sequence.


150
00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:37.664 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a closer look
at this example.


151
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,898 line:-1
As you're getting started,


152
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,234 line:-1
Mission to Mars highlights
three different requirements


153
00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:44.271 line:-1 position:50%
you need in your environment
to have a great session.


154
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.107 line:-1 position:50%
First, there's a reminder
that AR can be immersive,


155
00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:50.277 line:-1 position:50%
and it's wise to find
a safe place to engage with it.


156
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,811 line:-1
This can be a particular concern


157
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,180 line:-1
for experiences
that involve wayfinding,


158
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.749 line:-1 position:50%
where you'll need
to take extra care


159
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,917 line:-1
not to draw people's
attention to the screen


160
00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:01.021 line:-1 position:50%
for long periods of time.


161
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,456 line:-1
Next, the app suggests
that AR performs best


162
00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:05.225 line:-1 position:50%
on surfaces with texture,


163
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,362 line:-1
rather than on glass or
smooth white featureless planes.


164
00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:10.630 line:-1 position:50%
LiDAR can help overcome


165
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,999 line:-1
some of these challenging
environmental conditions,


166
00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:15.035 line:-1 position:50%
so you might be able
to omit this suggestion


167
00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:17.070 line:-1 position:50%
for some devices.


168
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,272 line:-1
And last, Mission to Mars
advises people


169
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,975 line:-1
to find a bright space
because AR works best


170
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,011 line:-1
in environments
that are properly lit.


171
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.747 line:-1 position:50%
What's great about this coaching
sequence is that it's quick,


172
00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:30.283 line:-1 position:50%
easy to navigate,
and helps people understand


173
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,920 line:-1
how to set up their environment
for the best AR experience.


174
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,923 line:-1
The next tip is to take
advantage of screen space.


175
00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:39.225 line:-1 position:50%
You'd be surprised
how large a role it can play


176
00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:41.394 line:-1 position:50%
in AR experience design.


177
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,596 line:-1
So, what is screen space?


178
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,498 line:-1
Think of screen space
as a 2D layer


179
00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:47.767 line:-1 position:50%
that sits on top of
the three-dimensional world


180
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,969 line:-1
that's captured by
your camera view.


181
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,472 line:-1
It's best to place text
and interactive elements


182
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.474 line:-1 position:50%
like buttons
here in screen space,


183
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,776 line:-1
rather than in the 3D world
of the camera


184
00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:58.812 line:-1 position:50%
to preserve legibility.


185
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,181 line:-1
Here's a great example
from the Mission to Mars app


186
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:04,818 line:-1
that illustrates how to handle
text in screen space.


187
00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:08.488 line:-1 position:50%
High-contrast text and buttons
sit in a 2D screen space layer


188
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.024 line:-1 position:50%
on top of the 3D scene below.


189
00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:14.260 line:-1 position:50%
The text updates as the camera
moves to help you understand


190
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,864 line:-1
how it relates to the 3D objects
in the scene.


191
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,667 line:-1
If you do need to lock your text
to something in the world,


192
00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:23.169 line:-1 position:50%
try to keep it billboarded
or parallel to the screen


193
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,838 line:-1
when possible.


194
00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.840 line:-1 position:50%
Focus on increasing contrast,


195
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.642 line:-1 position:50%
bumping up type sizes
and putting text on a background


196
00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:32.512 line:-1 position:50%
so you can maintain
accessibility.


197
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.647 line:-1 position:50%
Design for constant movement.


198
00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:36.249 line:-1 position:50%
It's important
that people understand


199
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,718 line:-1
how and when to move
their devices.


200
00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:40.754 line:-1 position:50%
Sometimes they'll need
to move their bodies as well


201
00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:43.523 line:-1 position:50%
in order to experience AR.


202
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,291 line:-1
Try to provide
real-time feedback


203
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,994 line:-1
with visual effects and sound
as people move,


204
00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:50.363 line:-1 position:50%
so that even if the action
is taking place out of view,


205
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,534 line:-1
people can still connect
with the experience.


206
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.203 line:-1 position:50%
Use simple, glanceable
instructions and animations


207
00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.272 line:-1 position:50%
to coach people how to move.


208
00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:01.775 line:-1 position:50%
It helps to place instructions
in screen space


209
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:05,812 line:-1
and to show them on an as-needed
basis, rather than all up front.


210
00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:08.815 line:-1 position:50%
It's great to leverage the
built-in coaching animations,


211
00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:11.551 line:-1 position:50%
but you can also create your own
onboarding instructions


212
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,886 line:-1
that relate to your app,


213
00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.088 line:-1 position:50%
like this example
from the app DoodleLens


214
00:09:15.088 --> 00:09:17.190 line:-1 position:50%
that shows an iPhone
panning back and forth


215
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,492 line:-1
in front of a doodle.


216
00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:23.997 line:-1 position:50%
Ergonomic considerations
are really important for AR.


217
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,899 line:-1
It can be exhausting
to hold your arm out


218
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.667 line:-1 position:50%
for long periods of time,


219
00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.269 line:-1 position:50%
and uncomfortable
to reach for buttons


220
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:33.306 line:-1 position:50%
that aren't positioned properly
for one-handed use.


221
00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:37.143 line:-1 position:50%
Emphasize legibility at arm's
length for the entire interface.


222
00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:39.779 line:-1 position:50%
Simplify interactions
so that they can be completed


223
00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:41.648 line:-1 position:50%
with minimal effort.


224
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,617 position:50%
Use oversized buttons
with high-contrast icons


225
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,387 position:50%
that are easy to tap
one-handed with a thumb.


226
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,389 line:0
Here's a nice example
at the bottom of the screen


227
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,091 line:0
in DoodleLens.


228
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,060 line:-1
People are viewing
AR experiences


229
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.595 line:-1 position:50%
with a limited field of view


230
00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:57.630 line:-1 position:50%
offered through
a handheld device,


231
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,766 line:-1
so there's a good chance
they might not be able to see


232
00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.168 line:-1 position:50%
the full extent
of something large.


233
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,871 line:-1
There's also a possibility
that a virtual object


234
00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:07.874 line:-1 position:50%
might be located out of view.


235
00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:10.443 line:-1 position:50%
Allow people to adjust
the scale of an object,


236
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,645 line:-1
in case they're not
able to back up far enough


237
00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:14.747 line:-1 position:50%
to see the whole thing.


238
00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:16.783 line:-1 position:50%
This example from AR Quick Look


239
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,086 line:-1
uses a pinch gesture
for direct manipulation.


240
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,489 line:-1
There's also a haptic
so that you can feel it


241
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:26,426 line:-1
when you scale something
past 100 percent.


242
00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:29.362 line:-1 position:50%
When something is out of view
to the right or to the left,


243
00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:32.298 line:-1 position:50%
use sounds and haptics
and provide simple indicators


244
00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:35.568 line:-1 position:50%
or text instructions
in screen space.


245
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,770 line:-1
It can also be helpful
to provide a map


246
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.607 line:-1 position:50%
or bird's-eye view
showing someone's orientation


247
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,742 line:-1
and illustrating
that the object is located


248
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,978 line:-1
in the opposite direction.


249
00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.347 line:-1 position:50%
In this example
from the RoomPlan experience,


250
00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:49.983 line:-1 position:50%
the small 3D model drawing
at the bottom of the view


251
00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.885 line:-1 position:50%
helps you preview your results


252
00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:55.288 line:-1 position:50%
and keep track of what has
been scanned so far.


253
00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:57.824 line:-1 position:50%
It can be difficult for people
peering through a screen


254
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,827 line:-1
to understand the location
of virtual objects in space


255
00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:03.196 line:-1 position:50%
unless they're behaving
realistically.


256
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,065 line:-1
Depth cues that help people see
how far away things are


257
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,967 line:-1
can help with this.


258
00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:10.537 line:-1 position:50%
The size of objects,
perspective effects


259
00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:12.639 line:-1 position:50%
like diminishing
towards the horizon,


260
00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:14.541 line:-1 position:50%
realistic shadows and lighting,


261
00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:16.776 line:-1 position:50%
the proper amount
of detail in your textures,


262
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,212 line:-1
and overlapping objects
create a feeling of depth


263
00:11:19.212 --> 00:11:22.749 line:-1 position:50%
and help people perceive
spatial relationships.


264
00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:25.485 line:-1 position:50%
I want to highlight one depth
cue that's tricky to work with


265
00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:27.320 line:-1 position:50%
but can really
help people understand


266
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.056 line:-1 position:50%
where things are located
relative to each other:


267
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,459 line:-1
overlapping,
also known as occlusion.


268
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,096 line:-1
Here's an example of overlapping
you can see in AR Quick Look.


269
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,265 line:-1
The virtual airplane
seems like it's positioned


270
00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:41.367 line:-1 position:50%
behind the wooden blocks
on the desk


271
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.003 line:-1 position:50%
because the lower part of it
is hidden.


272
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,539 line:0
Finally, craft experiences
that last


273
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,575 position:50%
no more than a minute or two.


274
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,110 line:0
This is for the ergonomic
reasons I mentioned earlier,


275
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,048 position:50%
but also because AR is
a resource-intensive superpower


276
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,352 position:50%
that has a big impact
on battery and thermals.


277
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,055 line:-1
If you do end up creating
a longer experience,


278
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.357 line:-1 position:50%
make sure that you
build in breaks.


279
00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:07.160 line:-1 position:50%
For All Mankind: Time Capsule
is an AR experience


280
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,697 line:-1
that allows you to explore
the For All Mankind universe.


281
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,498 line:-1
The app complements
the TV show,


282
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,935 line:-1
telling stories through
interactive objects.


283
00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:17.937 line:-1 position:50%
Time Capsule is
presented in chapters


284
00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:19.572 line:-1 position:50%
that provide moments of rest


285
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,376 line:-1
and a place to pause
then return to the experience.


286
00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:26.312 line:-1 position:50%
Today I shared tips to help
overcome some of the challenges


287
00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:28.848 line:-1 position:50%
with working on AR features.


288
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,250 line:-1
You've learned to guide people
to the right environment,


289
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.219 line:-1 position:50%
to take advantage
of screen space,


290
00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:35.021 line:-1 position:50%
to design for constant
movement,


291
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:38.157 line:-1 position:50%
to think about ergonomics
and a limited field of view,


292
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,327 line:-1
to use depth cues, and to limit
the duration of the experience


293
00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:43.830 line:-1 position:50%
to keep people
from getting fatigued.


294
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.699 line:-1 position:50%
Augmented Reality feels
like magic when it's useful,


295
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,636 line:-1
delightful, and relates
to the physical world.


296
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,771 line:-1
AR allows you
to see virtual objects


297
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.140 line:-1 position:50%
or even to transform
your environment.


298
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.176 line:-1 position:50%
You can attach digital
capabilities to physical things


299
00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:00.480 line:-1 position:50%
to create a layer of useful
information and actions.


300
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.582 line:-1 position:50%
The AR features and apps
that you create


301
00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:05.818 line:-1 position:50%
will transform how people work,
learn, play, shop,


302
00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:07.687 line:-1 position:50%
and connect with the world.


303
00:13:07.687 --> 00:13:09.222 line:-1 position:50%
I can't wait to see
what you'll build next


304
00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:10.690 line:-1 position:50%
in augmented reality.


305
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,158 line:-1
Thank you!
