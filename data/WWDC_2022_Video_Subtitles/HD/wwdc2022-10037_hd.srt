Kaely Coon: Hi, my name is Kaely Coon.

And I'm Jennifer Bush.

We're writers here at Apple,
working as part


6
00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.051 line:-1 align:center
of Human Interface design teams


7
00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:20.354 line:-1 align:center
across Apple products and services.


8
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:24,024 line:-2
Today, we're going to share some tips
and best practices we've learned


9
00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.426 line:-2 align:center
that we hope will help you,
as developers,


10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,263 line:-1
approach writing for your app or game.


11
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:33,100 line:-2
Kaely: Sometimes we're called
UX Writers or Content Designers,


12
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,337 line:-2
and what we write can be
referred to as strings, copy, or text,


13
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:41.742 line:-2 align:center
but essentially, it's our job
to design through the lens of language.


14
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:46,280 line:-2
From the earliest days at Apple,
we wanted to design devices for everyone.


15
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:49,416 line:-2
This meant they needed to be able
to communicate with anyone.


16
00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.852 line:-2 align:center
The first Macs were built
on the design principle


17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,422 line:-2
"what you see is what you get,"
which includes the language.


18
00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:59.993 line:-2 align:center
Mac was built using simple language
that was easy to understand.


19
00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:03.864 line:-2 align:center
It focused on the person using it,
welcoming you in,


20
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,000 line:-2
and now, across our products,
as soon as you turn them on,


21
00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:09.703 line:-1 align:center
we say "Hello."


22
00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:14.241 line:-2 align:center
Since those early days, we've continued
to be conversational in our interfaces.


23
00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.978 line:-2 align:center
When words work seamlessly with design,
you may not even notice them,


24
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,782 line:-2
but they're pivotal to every part
of a user experience.


25
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,651 line:-2
The words are there to help people
do what they want to do,


26
00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:29.423 line:-2 align:center
whether it's create a Memoji,
watch a movie, or find focus.


27
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,593 line:-2
Let's take a look at an app
with the words removed.


28
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:35,529 line:-1
Feels a bit empty, doesn't it?


29
00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:39.766 line:-2 align:center
In the Apple Music app, the visuals
give you a hint at what each section is,


30
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.037 line:-2 align:center
but would you know the difference
between an album and a playlist?


31
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,407 line:-2
How about how
to browse or listen to the radio?


32
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.676 line:-2 align:center
Even if there aren't
a lot of words on a screen,


33
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.047 line:-2 align:center
they help you understand what's expected,
and what to do next.


34
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:57,985 line:-2
And if you were to come across an error,
they'd help you find your way.


35
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:01,722 line:-2
Writing is about communicating,
which, of course, includes the words,


36
00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:05.225 line:-2 align:center
but it also includes the structure
of those words,


37
00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.997 line:-2 align:center
the timing in which they appear,
and the feeling people have reading them.


38
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,967 line:-2
I mentioned how UX writers
designed through the lens of language.


39
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,704 line:-2
Now, you may hear that and wonder,
"What does that even mean?"


40
00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:20.674 line:-2 align:center
It means the earlier you make writing
a part of the process


41
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,176 line:-1
of designing your app,


42
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,946 line:-2
the better the experience
will be for the people who use it.


43
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.415 line:-2 align:center
In this session,
we'll walk you through the types of things


44
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,552 line:-2
we consider as we develop
the words in our products.


45
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,354 line:-2
They're not the only things
we think about when we write,


46
00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:36.757 line:-1 align:center
as there are often many considerations,


47
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.825 line:-2 align:center
but we hope this provides
a useful framework


48
00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.361 line:-1 align:center
to keep in mind when writing for your app.


49
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:46,500 line:-1
These are: Purpose, Anticipation,


50
00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.936 line:-1 align:center
Context, and Empathy.


51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,639 line:-2
You'll notice we've given
you an acronym of "PACE,"


52
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,142 line:-2
which is an important thing
to consider while writing.


53
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,746 line:-2
Pace is about creating a natural flow
so you keep people engaged


54
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,583 line:-2
and interested
in what you're telling them.


55
00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:08.088 line:-2 align:center
This means knowing what to say,
how to say it, and when.


56
00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.891 line:-2 align:center
Now, I'll hand it to Jen
to talk about Purpose.


57
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,862 line:-2
Jen: As you develop the screens
in your app,


58
00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:18.799 line:-2 align:center
think about the most important thing
someone needs to know at that moment.


59
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,402 line:-2
That's the purpose of your screen.
So how do you convey that?


60
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,641 line:-1
First, consider information hierarchy,


61
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,210 line:-2
or how you order the elements
on the screen.


62
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,979 line:-1
Here's an example.


63
00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:34.982 line:-2 align:center
This is an intro screen
for a Messages flow.


64
00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:38.318 line:-2 align:center
You know the purpose because
it's right at the top:


65
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,954 line:-1
"Share Your Name and Photo with Friends."


66
00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:42.856 line:-1 align:center
You probably noticed that first.


67
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:48,695 line:0
Next, you might have read the button
that says "Choose Name and Photo."


68
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,332 line:0
We know people don't always read
the text on screen in order,


69
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,569 align:center
so make sure your headers
and buttons are clear.


70
00:03:56.837 --> 00:04:00.707 line:-2 align:center
The rest of the text on the screen
still has an important purpose.


71
00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:04.044 line:-2 align:center
It tells you what you can customize,
and that you can choose


72
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:08.582 line:-2 align:center
who you want to share this with,
but the text is a little smaller.


73
00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:13.387 line:-2 align:center
The information hierarchy helps
convey this screen's purpose.


74
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,689 line:-1
Know what to leave out.


75
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:20,027 line:-2
When you know the purpose of a screen,
you can make choices about which ideas


76
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,930 line:-2
you want to keep
in, which you can take out,


77
00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:25.599 line:-1 align:center
or which ones you can move someplace else.


78
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,635 line:0
Here's a wireframe of a made-up version


79
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,705 line:0
of a temperature warning screen
for iPhone.


80
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:36,577 line:0
The title says "iPhone Needs
to Cool Down." That sounds clear.


81
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,414 align:center
But there's a lot more text,
and this screen is trying to do too much.


82
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,951 align:center
Think about the purpose of the screen.


83
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:47,521 line:0
Is it to tell you
why iPhone needs to cool down?


84
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:52,793 line:0
If so, it tells you that you might
be in the sun or using too many apps.


85
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,396 line:0
Maybe it's to tell you that
you can still make an emergency call.


86
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,131 align:center
That button is pretty large.


87
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:02,503 align:center
It almost looks like the screen
is suggesting it's necessary.


88
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,606 line:0
Let's look at what we went with.


89
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,941 line:0
This screen is much simpler.


90
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,479 align:center
The headline is just "Temperature."


91
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,983 line:0
Because the thermometer image
conveys that the temperature is high,


92
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,485 line:0
we don't need to say that explicitly.


93
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,788 line:0
And the single sentence tells you
that iPhone needs to cool down


94
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,824 line:0
before you can use it.


95
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,293 align:center
The button just says "Emergency,"


96
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,562 line:0
so if you needed to make
an emergency call,


97
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,963 align:center
it would be clear what to do.


98
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:34,368 line:0
Rather than give too many details,
aim for simplicity.


99
00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:39.072 line:-2 align:center
You can tell people the purpose
of a screen; it's not a secret!


100
00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:42.743 line:-2 align:center
When introducing a new feature to someone,
for example,


101
00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:45.279 line:-2 align:center
tell them why it's there,
and why it's important.


102
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:50,617 align:center
In this intro screen with the header
"Wind Down Shortcuts," it tells you,


103
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,852 align:center
"Reducing screen time


104
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,254 line:0
is one of the best things you can do
before bed."


105
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,591 line:0
That's the purpose of this feature,
and now you know


106
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,660 align:center
why you might want to set it up.


107
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,329 line:-1
Have a purpose for every screen.


108
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:07.100 line:-2 align:center
When there are multiple steps in a flow,
define the purpose of the entire flow,


109
00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:09.570 line:-1 align:center
as well as each screen within it.


110
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:14,141 line:-2
This can help keep screens brief
and reduce unnecessary steps.


111
00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:17.344 line:-2 align:center
At the start,
think about how to welcome people in


112
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,146 line:-1
and teach them what they need to know.


113
00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:23.617 line:-4 align:center
Here are a few of the screens
in a flow designed to help you set up


114
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.485 line:-3 align:center
Apple Cash for family sharing.


115
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,656 line:-3
The text tells you who Apple Cash is for,


116
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,260 line:-4
"family members who are under 18,"
and what they can do with it,


117
00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:36.763 line:-4 align:center
"send and receive money and use
Apple Pay for purchases."


118
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,602 line:1
In this next step,
the purpose is to let you know


119
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:46,740 line:1
what you're going to do next,
verify your identity,


120
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,811 align:center
and give you some important information
about data and privacy.


121
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:54,982 line:1
This privacy information takes up
quite a bit of space on the screen,


122
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,750 line:1
but it's important.


123
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,520 align:center
Privacy is one of Apple's core values.


124
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,088 line:1
Think about your app's values


125
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,190 align:center
and make sure
they're represented throughout.


126
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,995 align:center
After you verify your identity,
and you're at the end of this flow,


127
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:11,331 line:0
you're still not quite ready
to start using the feature.


128
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,201 line:0
This "Almost Ready" screen tells you


129
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:18,405 line:0
that the "card activation may take a few
minutes," and to expect a notification.


130
00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:23.744 line:-2 align:center
And here it is!
Now you can send money with Apple Cash.


131
00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:27.581 line:-2 align:center
If you're having a hard time
deciding what to write on a screen,


132
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.383 line:-1 align:center
go back to its purpose.


133
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:34,488 line:-2
You can convey purpose
by considering information hierarchy,


134
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:40.160 line:-2 align:center
knowing what to leave out,
and having a purpose for every screen.


135
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,030 line:-2
Kaely:
Next, let's talk about Anticipation.


136
00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:48.869 line:-2 align:center
It helps to think of the words
in your app as part of a conversation.


137
00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:53.006 line:-2 align:center
A dialogue happens
between your app and whoever's using it.


138
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,310 line:-2
In any good conversation,
there's a back and forth.


139
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:00,981 line:-2
Sometimes you're listening, sometimes
you're talking, or asking questions.


140
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,183 line:-2
Similarly, in your app,
you're anticipating


141
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,419 line:-1
how to best communicate for each moment.


142
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.224 line:-2 align:center
Let's say it's a weekend
and you've decided to sleep in,


143
00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:13.026 line:-2 align:center
so you go to the Clock app
to change your alarm.


144
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.829 line:-2 align:center
You want to make sure you're changing
the alarm just for tomorrow,


145
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,097 line:-1
not your whole schedule.


146
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,934 align:center
The action sheet asks,
"Would you like to apply this change


147
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,669 line:0
to all weekends in this schedule?"


148
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:26,640 line:0
The first selection is
to "Change Next Alarm Only,"


149
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,475 align:center
anticipating that most of the time,


150
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,379 line:0
you're likely to just be thinking
about tomorrow's wake-up.


151
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,682 line:-2
When you head to bed,
the lock screen says "Sleep Well"


152
00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:38.418 line:-1 align:center
and tells you that Sleep Focus is on.


153
00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:42.489 line:-2 align:center
The small button shows you
that your alarm is set for 8:30 AM.


154
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,192 line:-2
"Sleep Well" has
a friendly and familiar tone,


155
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,428 line:-2
and acknowledges
that you're going to sleep.


156
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,731 line:-2
The next morning, if you get up
before the alarm


157
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,499 line:-1
and start using your iPhone,


158
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,903 line:-2
it anticipates that you might not want
that alarm to sound.


159
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,805 line:-1
So it asks, "It looks like you're awake.


160
00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.808 line:-2 align:center
Would you like to turn off
your alarm and sleep mode?"


161
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:06,180 line:-2
The conversation feels intuitive, like
your device is speaking to your needs.


162
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,415 line:-1
When it comes to being conversational,


163
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,985 line:-1
writers talk a lot about voice and tone.


164
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,323 line:-2
Develop your app's voice first,
and then you can vary its tone.


165
00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:20.661 line:-2 align:center
Start by asking yourself:
what would it say and not say?


166
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:24,031 line:-2
Are you developing a game
that's exciting and fun?


167
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,968 line:-2
Is it a banking app that needs
to be secure and trustworthy?


168
00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:30.237 line:-1 align:center
Is it an app that's kid-friendly?


169
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.073 line:-2 align:center
Think about who you're talking to
to help figure out the type


170
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,209 line:-1
of vocabulary you'll use.


171
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,945 line:-1
Make a list of commonly used terms.


172
00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:41.114 line:-2 align:center
This can help shape the voice
that you can also use for your website,


173
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,283 line:-1
emails, and other communication.


174
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:47,588 line:-2
Anticipating what people are going through
helps you consider your tone.


175
00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:51.491 line:-2 align:center
Here, Apple Watch says,
"It looks like you've taken a hard fall"


176
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,494 line:-2
and if you're okay,
you can answer, "I'm okay."


177
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:58,065 line:-2
The tone is calm and clear
in what could be a stressful moment.


178
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,502 line:-2
Apple has one consistent voice
that you'll recognize


179
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,737 line:-2
no matter which
of our devices you're using,


180
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,307 line:-2
but our tone changes
depending on the situation.


181
00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:10.177 line:-2 align:center
Think of how your tone of voice
changes when you pick up the phone


182
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.347 line:-2 align:center
and talk to your friend versus,
say, your bank.


183
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,684 line:-2
Here, in the Activity app on Watch,
when you've set a Move streak,


184
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,653 line:-1
it says, "You set a personal record


185
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,923 line:-2
for your longest daily Move streak:
35 days!"


186
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:27.060 line:-2 align:center
The tone is quite celebratory,
so it has an exclamation point.


187
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,029 line:-2
Be careful how often
you use those, though.


188
00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:30.731 line:-1 align:center
They can look silly when they're frequent.


189
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:35,969 line:-2
When writing for apps,
you always have to ask, "What comes next?"


190
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:39,473 line:-2
Anticipating the next action
or question someone's going to have


191
00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:41.208 line:-1 align:center
will help you know what to say.


192
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,578 line:-2
In the Breathe app on Apple Watch,
the instructions tell you


193
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,347 line:-2
to "Be still,
and bring your attention to your breath."


194
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:53,921 line:-2
You might not be sure how to start
doing that, so then it says, "Now inhale…"


195
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,389 line:-1
"And exhale."


196
00:10:55,422 --> 00:11:00,460 line:-2
It answers your question of how to use it,
as the visuals reinforce the message,


197
00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:03.830 line:-2 align:center
and the watch vibrates
to help with timing.


198
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:07,568 line:-2
And in this example from Maps,
when you're likely to be heading home,


199
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:11,672 line:-2
you see a notification that tells you
about your commute: "8 minutes to Home"


200
00:11:11.705 --> 00:11:15.108 line:-2 align:center
and to "Take Audubon Ave,
traffic is light."


201
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:19,446 line:-2
It helps you make a decision
by anticipating what you'll do next.


202
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,049 line:-2
When design
and text work closely together,


203
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,785 line:-1
an app feels seamless as you use it.


204
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,387 line:-1
Anticipation is about thinking of your app


205
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:29.523 line:-1 align:center
as being part of a conversation.


206
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:35,329 line:-2
Develop your voice and vary your tone
according to the situation.


207
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:40,133 line:-2
Then answer
the question of what comes next.


208
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,670 line:-2
Speaking directly to people
in the right way is one way to take


209
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:47,474 line:-2
your app experience from functional
to magical.


210
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:51,378 line:-1
Jen: Next, we'll cover context.


211
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,214 line:-1
Start by thinking outside the app.


212
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,417 line:-2
When someone uses your app,
are they likely to be at home


213
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:01,188 line:-2
in a quiet space,
or traveling at busy airport?


214
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,892 line:-2
Are they occupied with something else,
like driving or cooking,


215
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,561 line:-2
or can they give
your app their full attention?


216
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,297 line:-1
This reminder shows up on your Apple Watch


217
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,868 line:-2
if it notices that you're exercising,
but haven't started recording the workout.


218
00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:17.471 line:-1 align:center
The context is, you're on an outdoor walk,


219
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,274 line:-2
so you don't want
to have to stop to read a lot.


220
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:25,612 line:-2
There's one large button
clearly labeled "Record Outdoor Walk."


221
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:30,217 line:-2
On the other hand, once you stop
exercising, your context has changed.


222
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.519 line:-2 align:center
You can take in
a little bit more information,


223
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:36,156 line:-2
like your total distance,
average pace, and active calories.


224
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,861 line:0
Here, when taking a panorama photo,
your focus is split


225
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,298 align:center
between the camera app and whatever
you're trying to photograph.


226
00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:47.668 line:-2 align:center
An on-screen arrow guides you
with instructions,


227
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,771 line:0
to "Move continuously
when taking a Panorama."


228
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:55,242 align:center
The words appear right below the arrow
because that's where you're looking.


229
00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:59.479 line:-2 align:center
Now let's talk
about how to write helpful alerts.


230
00:12:59.513 --> 00:13:03.217 line:-2 align:center
Chances are, your app has some alerts,
which are best used


231
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,154 line:-2
when you want someone to confirm
an action or make a choice.


232
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:12,292 line:-2
They are, by their context, interruptions,
so you want your alerts to be helpful


233
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:13,560 line:-1
and clear.


234
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:16.530 line:-2 align:center
In this alert,
you've opened the Weather app,


235
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,867 line:-2
and it needs permission
to use your location.


236
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,505 line:-2
Because it appears at the time
you open the app, it feels contextual.


237
00:13:24.538 --> 00:13:28.775 line:-2 align:center
The alert also gives you the context
in which the permission will be used:


238
00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:32.012 line:-2 align:center
to show local weather
and send relevant notifications.


239
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:37,351 line:-2
Some alerts
might have a destructive action,


240
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:41,788 line:-2
or something that can't be undone,
like removing a device from your account.


241
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,024 line:-1
Let's take a closer look.


242
00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:46.960 line:-2 align:center
This alert asks the question
"Remove iPhone?"


243
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:51,298 line:-2
And the buttons answer
with Remove or Cancel.


244
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,135 line:-2
The context here is that someone
needs to make an important choice,


245
00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:58.005 line:-1 align:center
one in which they may lose information.


246
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:03,110 line:-2
"Remove" is the destructive action,
so its button is red and on the left.


247
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:06,246 line:-2
The "Cancel" button is on the right
and dismisses the alert


248
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.681 line:-1 align:center
without taking any action.


249
00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:12.085 line:-1 align:center
But be careful how you use Cancel.


250
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:15,756 line:-2
As you can see in this fake alert
for a made-up subscription,


251
00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:18.659 line:-1 align:center
the title of "Confirm Cancellation"


252
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,228 line:-2
makes it hard to know which button
to choose,


253
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,230 line:-1
the one on the left that says "Cancel"


254
00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:26.133 line:-2 align:center
or the one on the right
that says "Confirm."


255
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:30.571 line:-2 align:center
The rest of the text reads,
"If you confirm and end this plan now,


256
00:14:30.604 --> 00:14:34.842 line:-1 align:center
you'll lose access on June 21, 2022."


257
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,510 line:-1
This isn't giving much more help.


258
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,914 line:-2
It's unclear whether you're ending
this plan now


259
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,050 line:-1
or if you can still access it.


260
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,619 line:-1
The phrase "this plan" is also vague,


261
00:14:45.652 --> 00:14:48.088 line:-2 align:center
especially if you have
more than one subscription.


262
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,860 align:center
With a few small changes, we can fix it.


263
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:56,063 align:center
This new title
of "Cancel Platinum Subscription?"


264
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,466 align:center
tells you which subscription
you're canceling and matches well


265
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:03,570 align:center
with the buttons labeled
Cancel Subscription or Keep Subscription.


266
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:07,007 line:0
The message body is brief,
telling you


267
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,411 line:0
that "You'll continue
to have access until June 21, 2022."


268
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,414 align:center
You'll notice that the buttons


269
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,650 align:center
aren't labeled Yes and No.


270
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,953 line:0
When writing for alerts,
it's always best to be specific


271
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:22,689 line:0
about the action
the buttons are going to take.


272
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:25,859 align:center
On this alert, if you only read
the button labels,


273
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:28,061 align:center
you would still understand
what you were choosing.


274
00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:33.166 line:-2 align:center
Another context for seeing an alert
is when something goes wrong.


275
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.869 line:-2 align:center
Errors will often show up as alerts,
as shown


276
00:15:35.903 --> 00:15:38.138 line:-1 align:center
in this pretty unhelpful made-up example.


277
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:43,777 line:-2
The title of "Oops! you can't do that"
doesn't say what it is you can't do.


278
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:48.715 line:-2 align:center
You're unlikely to know
what the error code 1234567 means,


279
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:51.718 line:-2 align:center
and the rest of the message,
"Sorry, bad input.


280
00:15:51.752 --> 00:15:54.888 line:-2 align:center
Please try again,"
doesn't add any information.


281
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:58,859 line:-2
And it's unclear why there
are two buttons, Okay and Cancel.


282
00:15:58.892 --> 00:16:01.528 line:-2 align:center
It seems like they'd both do
the same thing.


283
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:05,899 line:-2
As for the tone of the message,
interjections like "oops!" or "uh-oh"


284
00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:07.534 line:-1 align:center
can sound patronizing,


285
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,804 line:-2
and "please" and "sorry"
can sound insincere.


286
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:12,606 line:-1
Use them sparingly.


287
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,610 line:0
Here's an example of a better message.


288
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,580 line:0
The title clearly tells you
there's a billing problem,


289
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:22,783 line:0
and the text explains
exactly what to do about it.


290
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:26,053 line:0
To continue
accessing your subscription,


291
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,955 align:center
add a new payment method.


292
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,592 line:0
The top button, Add Payment Method,
takes you right to where


293
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,060 line:0
you can fix the problem,


294
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:35,262 line:0
and the second button, Not Now,


295
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,699 align:center
lets you continue what you were doing
so you can come back later.


296
00:16:38.732 --> 00:16:42.703 line:-2 align:center
Now let's talk
about how to create useful empty states,


297
00:16:42.736 --> 00:16:46.073 line:-2 align:center
or places in your app
where there isn't any content.


298
00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:49.943 line:-2 align:center
Empty states can be times for education
or even celebration,


299
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:52,913 line:-2
like when you complete the last item
on your to-do list,


300
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,215 line:-1
but it depends on context.


301
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,117 line:-1
Here's another example.


302
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,952 line:-1
In this made up restaurant app,


303
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:01,855 line:-2
you haven't saved anything
to your favorites.


304
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,925 line:-2
It uses the title
"Nothing strike your fancy?"


305
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,027 line:-1
which has a whimsical feeling.


306
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.830 line:-2 align:center
That can work
if it matches the voice of your app,


307
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:14,134 line:-2
but the idiom might not be
universally understood or translate well,


308
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,603 line:-1
and the text,


309
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:19,306 line:-2
"Please come back if you do find
something you want to eat,"


310
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,409 line:-2
doesn't give any useful guidance
or indication of how content


311
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,510 line:-1
might show up here.


312
00:17:25.012 --> 00:17:28.081 line:-2 align:center
On the other hand,
the Apple Podcasts library


313
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:31,618 line:-2
clearly tells you that you have
"No Saved Episodes."


314
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,121 line:-1
It then explains that you can


315
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,723 line:-2
"Save episodes
you want to listen to later,


316
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:38,592 line:-1
and they'll show up here."


317
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,194 line:-1
Much better.


318
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,830 line:-1
So to recap, when thinking about context,


319
00:17:43.864 --> 00:17:45.566 line:-1 align:center
think outside of the app,


320
00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:48.268 line:-2 align:center
about what else people
might be doing while using it.


321
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,374 line:-2
Write helpful alerts that are contextual
and offer clear choices.


322
00:17:56,043 --> 00:18:00,047 line:-2
And create useful empty states
by using an appropriate tone


323
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,782 line:-1
and giving helpful guidance.


324
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,419 line:-1
Kealy: Finally, let's talk about empathy.


325
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,057 line:-1
In user experience writing, having empathy


326
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,893 line:-2
means you should aim
to write for everyone.


327
00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:16.463 line:-2 align:center
Your app might have a specific audience,
like musicians,


328
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:20,701 line:-2
gamers, or other developers,
and you should speak to them,


329
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:23,403 line:-1
but you don't want leave anyone out.


330
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:29,109 line:-2
It's best to use simple, plain language,
as idioms and humor can be misunderstood


331
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:33,347 line:-2
or not translate, and some phrases
have meanings that exclude people.


332
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:39,319 line:-2
A key aspect of empathy is
being responsive to localization needs.


333
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,855 line:-2
Your app could be used
by people all over the world.


334
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:44,057 line:-1
That's an exciting opportunity!


335
00:18:44.091 --> 00:18:48.362 line:-2 align:center
It also means your app needs to adapt
to a lot of languages and cultures.


336
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.366 line:-2 align:center
When you translate
from one language to another,


337
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:55,102 line:-1
words can get longer or shorter.


338
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,038 line:-2
Some languages
require more vertical space.


339
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,439 line:-1
Someone could be using your app


340
00:18:59.473 --> 00:19:01.742 line:-2 align:center
with a language that reads
from left to right,


341
00:19:01.775 --> 00:19:03.343 line:-1 align:center
or right to left.


342
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:04,778 line:-1
Here's an example.


343
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,815 line:-2
This is the confirmation you see
when changing languages on iPhone,


344
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:10,884 line:-1
in this case, from English to Thai.


345
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,121 line:0
In English, the notification reads,


346
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,224 line:0
"Applying this setting will restart
your iPhone,"


347
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,993 line:0
with the buttons
Change to Thai and Cancel.


348
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:23,997 line:0
In Thai, the text
at the top is a little longer,


349
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,367 line:0
and the space
accommodates the taller characters,


350
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:30,270 line:0
while in Dutch, the text is much longer.


351
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:35,242 line:0
The space at the top grows
so the text can continue to a second line.


352
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,846 line:0
And here's Hebrew,
a language that reads right to left.


353
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:43,483 line:-2
There are also considerations
beyond just word length.


354
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,718 line:-1
In U.S. English,


355
00:19:44.751 --> 00:19:47.054 line:-2 align:center
the calendar abbreviations
for the days of the week


356
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:52,893 line:-2
are a single letter, M for Monday,
T for Tuesday, and so on.


357
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,763 line:-2
But in Catalan,
the days of the week are abbreviated


358
00:19:56.797 --> 00:19:57.865 line:-1 align:center
to two letters--


359
00:19:57.898 --> 00:20:01.101 line:-1 align:center
there isn't a single-letter variation--


360
00:20:01.134 --> 00:20:04.605 line:-2 align:center
while in Arabic, the days of the week
are not abbreviated at all.


361
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,842 line:-2
Your UI needs to be able to adapt
to those language changes.


362
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,979 line:-1
Now let's talk about accessibility.


363
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:15,916 line:-2
It's important to welcome
everyone into your app.


364
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,685 line:-2
For your app to be used
by as many people as possible,


365
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:22,055 line:-2
it needs to speak
to as many people as possible.


366
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:25,759 line:-2
Someone who is blind or has low vision,
for example, may set their device


367
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:30,030 line:-2
to display bold or larger text,
or use VoiceOver to navigate.


368
00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:35.035 line:-2 align:center
Pay attention to the language you use
for labeling the elements in your app.


369
00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:38.605 line:-2 align:center
Those words will be some people's
entire experience using it,


370
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,974 line:-2
and you want
that experience to be well designed.


371
00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:45.679 line:-2 align:center
Every element needs to have thoughtful,
useful, descriptive text.


372
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,849 line:-2
This includes not just
the Voice Over text for navigation items,


373
00:20:48.882 --> 00:20:54.922 line:-2 align:center
like links and buttons, but any symbols,
graphs, or images as well.


374
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:58,559 line:-2
Let's look at how Voice Over
describes a few Memoji Stickers.


375
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:02,329 line:-2
This first one is described
as "Person tilting head to the side


376
00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:05.532 line:-2 align:center
with hand beside mouth
as if sharing a secret."


377
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:08,802 line:-2
Notice that it isn't just
the physical details that are described,


378
00:21:08.836 --> 00:21:11.338 line:-2 align:center
but the intention,
"as if sharing a secret."


379
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,475 line:-2
The second is described
as "person meditating


380
00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:18.312 line:-2 align:center
with relaxed arms
and forefingers touching."


381
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:23,350 line:-2
Again, both the physical details--
relaxed arms and forefingers touching--


382
00:21:23.383 --> 00:21:26.086 line:-2 align:center
and the context
of meditation are described.


383
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:30,490 line:0
And the third example
again describes both context


384
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:34,261 line:0
and position:
nervous person biting fingernails.


385
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:38,098 line:0
Notice also that each of these examples
is described as a "person,"


386
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,667 align:center
not, say, a "man" or a "woman."


387
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:43,270 line:0
You can also help everyone
feel welcome in your app


388
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:47,374 line:0
by avoiding unnecessary references
to specific genders.


389
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:50,844 line:0
Be equally thoughtful
about any descriptive language you use.


390
00:21:51.612 --> 00:21:55.415 line:-2 align:center
It's critical to use empathy
when writing for your app.


391
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:58,051 line:-1
Write for everyone, using simple language.


392
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:03,123 line:-2
Be responsive to localization needs,
including text size changes.


393
00:22:04.124 --> 00:22:07.194 line:-2 align:center
And design for accessibility,
using thoughtful text


394
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:10,130 line:-1
for people who use VoiceOver to navigate.


395
00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:12.900 line:-2 align:center
Don't be afraid to review
your app's language often,


396
00:22:12.933 --> 00:22:14.401 line:-1 align:center
and change things.


397
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:18,872 line:-2
Just as language evolves more broadly,
so should the words your app uses.


398
00:22:18.906 --> 00:22:21.775 line:-2 align:center
There is so much more
to know about these topics.


399

about designing inclusive apps.

00:22:26.813 --> 00:22:31.351 line:-2 align:center
Today, we talked about Purpose,
Anticipation,


402
00:22:31.385 --> 00:22:33.887 line:-1 align:center
Context, and Empathy,


403
00:22:33.921 --> 00:22:37.591 line:-2 align:center
four concepts you can use to make sure
the text in your app or game


404
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,760 line:-1
is well designed.


405
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:42,896 line:-2
We hope you saw the value
of considering writing early,


406
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:47.367 line:-2 align:center
as part of your design process,
not as something you fill in later.


407
00:22:47.401 --> 00:22:50.838 line:-2 align:center
Jen: And if you do find yourself
struggling to find the right words,


408
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:54,041 line:-2
we have one last tip for you,
and it's the simplest one:


409
00:22:54.074 --> 00:22:56.577 line:-1 align:center
read your writing out loud.


410
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,180 line:-2
It can really help make sure
your writing sounds conversational,


411
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:01,748 line:-1
like how you'd talk to a friend.


412
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:07,087 line:-2
Reading out loud can also help you
find unnecessary or repetitive words,


413
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.356 line:-1 align:center
grammatical mistakes, or typos.


414
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,924 line:-1
Those details matter.


415
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:14,127 line:-2
Kaely: Writing for interfaces
begins with curiosity


416
00:23:14.161 --> 00:23:16.597 line:-1 align:center
for who's on the other side of the screen.


417
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.499 line:-2 align:center
Speak to them
with respect and understanding,


418
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,768 line:-1
and we know you'll find the right words.
