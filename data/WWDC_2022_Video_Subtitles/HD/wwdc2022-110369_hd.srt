Hi! My name is Bea, and I'm
a human interface designer


5
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,648 line:-1
on the Documentation team.


6
00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:17.251 line:-1 position:50%
I'm going to share how to
improve the discoverability


7
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.920 line:-1 position:50%
of your Swift-DocC content.


8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,390 line:-1
In this session, I'll talk about
the new navigation experience


9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,294 line:-1
available for Swift-DocC
documentation on the web


10
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,730 line:-1
and share tips for how
to optimize your content


11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,499 line:-1
for discoverability.


12
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,836 position:50%
If you need some additional
context on what Swift-DocC is


13
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,305 line:0
and how you can make
great documentation


14
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:40,774 position:50%
for your frameworks
and apps with it,


15
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,910 position:50%
check out these other
WWDC sessions.


16
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:49,416 line:-1
Now, let's jump in and check out
the new navigation on the web.


17
00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.452 line:-1 position:50%
This year, when you publish
your documentation site,


18
00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.254 line:-1 position:50%
you get a new
navigation experience


19
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,658 line:-1
that brings out
the best in your content.


20
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,227 line:-1
The page contains
two main sections.


21
00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:03.764 line:-1 position:50%
To the left is a navigator
and filter bar that allow you


22
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,999 line:-1
to navigate through
your documentation


23
00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.502 line:-1 position:50%
and find APIs quickly.


24
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,004 line:-1
To the right
is the content view.


25
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.941 line:-1 position:50%
It's optimized to be flexible
in multiple screen


26
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:16.276 line:-1 position:50%
and navigator sizes.


27
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,912 line:-1
Since the navigator
is separate from the content,


28
00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:22.749 line:-1 position:50%
it's easy to quickly switch
between different pages.


29
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,885 line:-1
You can also use
the disclosure indicators


30
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,687 line:-1
to explore deeper
in the tree


31
00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:29.623 line:-1 position:50%
and understand
the API hierarchy.


32
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,725 line:-1
All of these features
make it way easier


33
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,361 line:-1
to explore documentation.


34
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,863 line:0
On the other hand, if you know
what you're looking for


35
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,466 position:50%
and you want to get there
as quickly as possible,


36
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,035 position:50%
you can use the Filter bar
to refine the results


37
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,204 line:0
in the navigator.


38
00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:46.773 line:-1 position:50%
Let's see the filter in action.


39
00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.910 line:-1 position:50%
Let's say that
you're looking for "Habitat."


40
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,145 line:0
When you click on
the Filter bar and type that in,


41
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,181 line:0
you'll get a filtered view
of the pages


42
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,651 line:0
you actually care about,
right now.


43
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:01,121 line:0
You can clear the filter
to reset the navigator.


44
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,191 position:50%
And you can also filter
to see articles, tutorials,


45
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:08,829 line:0
and even hide deprecated pages
by selecting tags.


46
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,898 line:0
For example, if you select
the Tutorials tag,


47
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,967 line:0
it's super convenient to find


48
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,671 line:0
the "Meet SlothCreator"
tutorial.


49
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,208 line:-1
Now that you're up to date
with what's new in navigation,


50
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,643 line:-1
I'm going to talk about
how to make the most


51
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,679 line:-1
out of this new experience.


52
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,281 line:-1
Here are some tips and tricks
for how you can optimize


53
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:31,118 line:-1
your content so developers
find the pages


54
00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:35.155 line:-1 position:50%
they're looking for
as smoothly as possible.


55
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,225 line:0
Let me show you how
I optimized the documentation


56
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,828 position:50%
for my framework,
SlothCreator, as an example.


57
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,197 line:0
You can use SlothCreator
to catalog sloths


58
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:49,136 position:50%
you find in nature and to create
new, adorable virtual sloths.


59
00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:52.139 line:-1 position:50%
I just finished working
on my framework documentation,


60
00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.141 line:-1 position:50%
so I haven't written
any markdown


61
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.543 line:-1 position:50%
to organize my pages yet.


62
00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.512 line:-1 position:50%
As a starting point,
I'm taking advantage


63
00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:02.682 line:-1 position:50%
of Swift-DocC's
automatic organization.


64
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,352 line:-1
This means my navigator
is organized by types,


65
00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:12.192 line:-1 position:50%
like tutorials, articles,
protocols, and structures.


66
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,363 line:-1
This is already a great start,
but I can do a better job


67
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,299 line:-1
guiding developers
through my documentation.


68
00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.003 line:-1 position:50%
To optimize my content,
I'm going to follow three steps.


69
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,341 line:-1
First, define the main
high-level themes


70
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,944 line:-1
of what I can do
with this framework.


71
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:36,049 line:-1
Then, I'll organize my pages
by importance and specificity.


72
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,753 line:-1
Last but not least,
I'll optimize my group titles


73
00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:44.091 line:-1 position:50%
to make sure they're as clear
and helpful as possible.


74
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:48,428 line:-1
I think of this process
as creating a map.


75
00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.997 line:-1 position:50%
It helps people
understand the boundaries


76
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,366 line:-1
and general characteristics
of a region


77
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:57,070 line:-1
and figure out how to get
from one place to another.


78
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,140 line:-1
Likewise, the documentation
navigator helps developers


79
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.843 line:-1 position:50%
understand what you can do
with a set of APIs


80
00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:06.746 line:-1 position:50%
and how to navigate to the pages
they're looking for.


81
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,583 line:-1
I'll start by helping developers
understand what they can do


82
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,986 line:-1
with my APIs by defining
the main high-level themes


83
00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:15.422 line:-1 position:50%
of SlothCreator.


84
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:18.058 line:-1 position:50%
These themes will show up
on the navigator


85
00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:19.693 line:-1 position:50%
on the SlothCreator page,


86
00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:22.395 line:-1 position:50%
the top-level page
of my documentation.


87
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,831 line:-1
It'll be one of the first things
developers see


88
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,901 line:-1
when they land
on my documentation website.


89
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:31,138 line:-1
This is my opportunity
to make a great first impression


90
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,740 line:-1
and help developers
have a good understanding


91
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.843 line:-1 position:50%
of what this framework does.


92
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,412 line:-1
Now, let me think
about my first theme.


93
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,948 line:-1
One of the main functionalities
of SlothCreator


94
00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.451 line:-1 position:50%
is creating sloths.


95
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:48.722 line:-1 position:50%
They have names, colors,
and even special powers.


96
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:53,660 line:-1
To summarize, I'll call this
topic group "Sloth Creation"


97
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,096 line:-1
Later, I'll decide what pages
to include in this group,


98
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,965 line:-1
so I'll just leave
a placeholder for now.


99
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,902 line:-1
After you create a sloth,
you can visualize it


100
00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:04.838 line:-1 position:50%
in many different ways,
like on an app screen,


101
00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:06.706 line:-1 position:50%
in a map view.


102
00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:10.577 line:-1 position:50%
I'll call this "Sloth Views"


103
00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:13.713 line:-1 position:50%
And of course,
sloths are a lot of work.


104
00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:17.751 line:-1 position:50%
They need to be fed,
entertained, taken care of.


105
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:21,188 line:-1
I'll call this "Management"


106
00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:23.056 line:-1 position:50%
There's already
a lot of functionalities


107
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,192 line:-1
you can achieve
in these three groups.


108
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,527 line:-1
And putting myself
in the shoes of a developer


109
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,996 line:-1
who's never used
SlothCreator before,


110
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,965 line:-1
I'd love to have
an easy way


111
00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:35.101 line:-1 position:50%
to see how to get started
with this framework.


112
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.804 line:-1 position:50%
With this in mind,
I'll create a topic group


113
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,274 line:-1
with high-level
introductory content.


114
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,744 position:50%
I'll call it "Essentials."


115
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,148 position:50%
Awesome! Even though
there are hundreds of things


116
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,117 line:0
you can do with SlothCreator,
I'm only highlighting


117
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,956 position:50%
the four most important,
overarching topic groups.


118
00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:58.458 line:-1 position:50%
By reducing the number
of options that are available,


119
00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:01.161 line:-1 position:50%
I'm increasing
developers' chances


120
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:04.297 line:-1 position:50%
of successfully taking
the next step.


121
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,234 line:-1
There's no magic number
for how many topic groups


122
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,202 line:-1
I should create,
but I generally try


123
00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.772 line:-1 position:50%
to stick to under
10 per page.


124
00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:14.774 line:-1 position:50%
Thinking back
to the idea of a map,


125
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,510 line:-1
I want to give developers
step-by-step guidance


126
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.479 line:-1 position:50%
on where they can go next.


127
00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.784 line:-1 position:50%
The order of my groups is vital
to create a great experience.


128
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,720 line:0
Taking another look
at my topic groups,


129
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,022 position:50%
they're mostly in a good order.


130
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,024 position:50%
First, you have
to create a sloth,


131
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:34,861 line:0
then you can visualize it,
then you can manage it.


132
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,030 line:0
The only thing
I'd change here for now


133
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,600 position:50%
is moving Essentials
up to the beginning of the list,


134
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,437 line:0
so developers see
that beginner content first.


135
00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:47.307 line:-1 position:50%
Now, it's time to decide
the pages and themes


136
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:51,578 line:-1
that should be organized under
each one of these categories.


137
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,780 line:-1
Let me start with Essentials.


138
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.815 line:-1 position:50%
This will be at the very top
of the navigator


139
00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:59.119 line:-1 position:50%
and probably one of the first
things developers will see.


140
00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.221 line:-1 position:50%
So I want to make sure
this features


141
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:05.325 line:-1 position:50%
the most important
introductory content.


142
00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.060 line:-1 position:50%
This is a great spot
to highlight


143
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,996 line:-1
introductory articles
and tutorials.


144
00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:11.064 line:-1 position:50%
This enables developers


145
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,000 line:-1
to find step-by-step
code examples quickly,


146
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.072 line:-1 position:50%
which is, personally,
my favorite way to learn.


147
00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:20.740 line:-1 position:50%
With these considerations
in mind,


148
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,144 line:-1
I decided to organize
three groups under Essentials:


149
00:07:24.144 --> 00:07:27.080 line:-1 position:50%
the "Meet SlothCreator"
tutorial,


150
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,816 line:-1
the "Getting Started
with Sloths" article,


151
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:34,854 line:-1
and the Sloth struct, one of
the core APIs in my framework.


152
00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:38.591 line:-1 position:50%
I'll repeat this same process
for the three other groups.


153
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.828 line:-1 position:50%
This feels approachable
because I see the most important


154
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,763 line:-1
and broad themes first.


155
00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:45.532 line:-1 position:50%
As I explore deeper in the tree,


156
00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:49.069 line:-1 position:50%
the groups get more specific
and advanced.


157
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,371 line:-1
For instance, inside Essentials,


158
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:53.673 line:-1 position:50%
I'll find
Getting Visual Attributes.


159
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,942 line:0
And inside
Getting Visual Attributes,


160
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,713 line:0
I'll find
Getting the Standard Colors.


161
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,382 line:-1
Great, my documentation
is organized in a way


162
00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:05.885 line:-1 position:50%
to guide developers through
the content successfully.


163
00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:09.089 line:-1 position:50%
Next, I want to make sure
the titles of my topic groups


164
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,324 line:-1
are also high quality.


165
00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.561 line:-1 position:50%
The first characteristic
to a great topic group title


166
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:18,398 line:-1
is that it should be
clear and descriptive.


167
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,101 line:-1
A good title makes sense
on its own


168
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:24,471 line:-1
and doesn't need much
additional context.


169
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,206 line:-1
Thinking back
to my topic titles,


170
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,775 line:-1
there's some room
for improvement.


171
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:32,345 line:-1
The last topic title I wrote
is "Management."


172
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,148 line:-1
This group of APIs is all
about what you can do


173
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,651 line:-1
to manage your sloth's
well-being: Activity,


174
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:42,989 line:-1
CareSchedule, FoodGenerator,
and Sloth.Food.


175
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,492 line:-1
At first glance,
this seems like a good title.


176
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:49,596 line:-1
However,
upon further consideration,


177
00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:51.631 line:-1 position:50%
"Management"
is such a broad term;


178
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,901 line:-1
it could mean a ton
of different things.


179
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,603 line:-1
So it's not ideal.


180
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:59,105 line:-1
To make this clearer
and more descriptive,


181
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,776 line:-1
I'm going to call it
"Care and Feeding."


182
00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:04.778 line:-1 position:50%
Now, I understand
this group is all about


183
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,248 line:-1
taking care of my sloths
and giving them food.


184
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,550 line:-1
For that reason,
it's also important


185
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,387 line:-1
that topic group titles
be mutually exclusive.


186
00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.256 line:-1 position:50%
If I have titles
that are interchangeable,


187
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:20,860 line:-1
it's hard to know which one
contains what I'm looking for.


188
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.363 line:-1 position:50%
For example,
Fueling Superpowers,


189
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,366 line:-1
Getting Magical Abilities,
and Casting Enchantments


190
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,134 line:-1
are very similar themes


191
00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:32.605 line:-1 position:50%
and could probably be organized
under a single title.


192
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:36,075 line:-1
By keeping the names as
mutually exclusive as possible,


193
00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.911 line:-1 position:50%
I'm making it simpler
for developers


194
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.280 line:-1 position:50%
to figure out
where to go next.


195
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.384 line:-1 position:50%
The more work I put into
organization and page titles,


196
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:48,021 line:-1
the more likely developers
will have a smooth path


197
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:50.123 line:-1 position:50%
to the page
they're looking for.


198
00:09:50.123 --> 00:09:53.092 line:-1 position:50%
Also, the more likely
I'll encourage serendipity;


199
00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:56.763 line:-1 position:50%
in other words,
happy accidents.


200
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,632 line:-1
By organizing well-thought-out
themes next to each other,


201
00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:05.004 line:-1 position:50%
I'm enabling developers to find
relevant, related pages.


202
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,641 line:-1
For example, as I'm learning
about SlothCreator Essentials,


203
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:14,147 line:-1
I'm delighted to find Getting
Magical Abilities in the list.


204
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,849 line:-1
All of these tips and tricks


205
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,651 line:-1
really brought my documentation
to the next level.


206
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,321 line:-1
It's so much better!


207
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,824 line:-1
Now, let's review how you can
improve the discoverability


208
00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:29.395 line:-1 position:50%
of your content and make it
approachable for developers.


209
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:34,000 line:-1
First, identify the main themes
of your documentation.


210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,138 line:-1
Then, organize your content
by importance and specificity.


211
00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:43.009 line:-1 position:50%
Next, encourage serendipity,
by organizing related themes


212
00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:44.878 line:-1 position:50%
next to each other.


213
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:48,915 line:-1
Last but not least, write clear,
mutually exclusive titles


214
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,951 line:-1
for your pages and groups.


215
00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:53.620 line:-1 position:50%
Thank you for taking the time


216
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,923 line:-1
to learn how to make
your documentation better.


217
00:10:56.923 --> 00:11:00.059 line:-1 position:50%
I'm sure developers
will deeply appreciate it.


218
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,761 line:-1
Have a great WWDC!
