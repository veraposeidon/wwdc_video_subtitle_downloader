It's time to review day four.


4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,777
Roll the tape!


5
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,446
We checked in with Raj
on how you can


6
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:15,182
organize your iPad interface
with SwiftUI.


7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:18,252
- Better support for
state restoration, deep linking,


8
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,487
and even richer
programmatic control.


9
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:21,822
- Cool.


10
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,625
- Then Sara showed us how
to bring the power of SwiftUI


11
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,493
to your UIKit apps.


12
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,061
- You can use
the hosting controller


13
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,430
anywhere you can use
a view controller in UIKit.


14
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,798
- Later on,
Brett took us through


15
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,166
the latest updates for Vision.


16
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,669
- Here we compute optical flow
for a short clip


17
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,538
of this dog fetching
a water bottle on a beach.


18
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,873
- And we discovered
how to create


19
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,576
compelling
SharePlay experiences.


20
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,578
- Think of SharePlay
like a portal,


21
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,580
transporting people
through their phones


22
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,181
and into the same space.


23
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,983
- We also got a lesson
in language


24
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,785
from Apple's interface writers.


25
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,354
- Writing for interfaces
begins with curiosity


26
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,790
for who's on the other side
of the screen.


27
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,760
- And now for the intel
on day five.
