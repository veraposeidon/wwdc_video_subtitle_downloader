75

More people than ever
are relying on FaceTime


76
00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.569 line:-1 position:50%
and iMessage in order
to stay connected.


77
00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.774 line:-1 position:50%
With iMessage, we connect by
sharing text or sharing images,


78
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,011 line:-1
and with FaceTime, we connect
by sharing audio and video.


79
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.882 line:-1 position:50%
However, some of the most
meaningful moments


80
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,951 line:-1
people have together
are about more


81
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.387 line:-1 position:50%
than just sharing
a conversation.


82
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:45.292 line:-1 position:50%
When we're together, we connect
most by sharing experiences.


83
00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:47.561 line:-1 position:50%
So to foster that sense
of closeness,


84
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,663 line:-1
we built SharePlay,


85
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,632 position:50%
and by adopting the
Group Activities framework,


86
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,602 position:50%
you can connect people
in this entirely new way


87
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,505 line:0
by allowing them to participate
in SharePlay activities


88
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,874 line:0
in your app.


89
00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:04.478 line:-1 position:50%
It all comes down
to this concept of activities.


90
00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:07.414 line:-1 position:50%
When someone in a FaceTime call
starts an activity,


91
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,484 line:-1
SharePlay brings the
group directly into your app,


92
00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:14.788 line:-1 position:50%
where you can create
almost any type of experience.


93
00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.491 line:-1 position:50%
And an activity can
really be anything;


94
00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:20.827 line:-1 position:50%
from cooking together,
to playing piano together.


95
00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:23.563 line:-1 position:50%
We've seen a lot of
creative examples of activities


96
00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:25.232 line:-1 position:50%
from you already.


97
00:04:25.232 --> 00:04:27.801 line:-1 position:50%
And this year,
we focused on elevating


98
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,738 line:-1
the core SharePlay experience,
making it even easier


99
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,275 line:-1
for people to share experiences
in your app.


100
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,346 line:-1
Now, people can start SharePlay
directly from your app.


101
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:42,115 line:-1
When someone finds that perfect
piece of content in your app


102
00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.284 line:-1 position:50%
that they want to share
with their friends,


103
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,487 line:-1
they can choose who they want
to experience that content with


104
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,291 line:-1
and invite them to SharePlay
directly from your app.


105
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,227 line:-1
This way, people can jump
into a shared experience


106
00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:57.731 line:-1 position:50%
with their friends whenever
it feels most natural for them,


107
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,301 line:-1
without having
to plan in advance.


108
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,038 position:50%
They'll even get the option to
start SharePlay from Messages,


109
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,374 line:0
letting them share an experience
with their friends


110
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,809 line:0
without needing to be
on a FaceTime call.


111
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,679 line:0
We think people are going
to love all the new ways


112
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,148 position:50%
they can start SharePlay
from your app.


113
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,517 position:50%
We'll go over how to adopt
all of these new features


114
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,487 position:50%
in the session
"What's new in SharePlay."


115
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,122 line:-1
And that just scratches
the surface


116
00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.090 line:-1 position:50%
of what SharePlay can do


117
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,060 line:-1
but we think the real potential
of SharePlay is unlocked


118
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,630 line:-1
when you unleash your creativity
to build experiences


119
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.533 line:-1 position:50%
that bring people
closer together.


120
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,370 line:-1
And a big part of that is
fostering a sense of presence.


121
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,540 line:-1
So before we go into how
to build these experiences,


122
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,676 line:-1
we first have to understand
what it means


123
00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.645 line:-1 position:50%
to be present with others
and how to take aspects


124
00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.514 line:-1 position:50%
of a great in-person
experience


125
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,283 line:-1
and bring them into your apps.


126
00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:53.887 line:-1 position:50%
Typically, digital communication
tools are designed to bridge


127
00:05:53.887 --> 00:05:57.157 line:-1 position:50%
the gaps in presence,
but in order for SharePlay


128
00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:59.893 line:-1 position:50%
to create meaningful moments
between people,


129
00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:02.796 line:-1 position:50%
we need to find ways to actually
make people feel present


130
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,800 line:-1
with each other, as if they were
in the same physical space.


131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,202 line:-1
Now, knowing how to foster
this sense of presence


132
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,105 line:-1
can be different
for every experience


133
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,507 line:-1
but one trick we can do
is to think about your app


134
00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:17.143 line:-1 position:50%
being used
in the physical world.


135
00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:20.180 line:-1 position:50%
So, here's an exercise
we recommend doing:


136
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,583 line:-1
think of SharePlay like
a portal transporting people


137
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,519 line:-1
through their phones
and into the same space.


138
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,821 line:-1
What would they do with your app


139
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:30,624 line:-1
if they were actually present
with each other?


140
00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:33.293 line:-1 position:50%
If that sounds impossible,
don't worry.


141
00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:35.362 line:-1 position:50%
We'll go over some ways
that you can foster


142
00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:38.298 line:-1 position:50%
this sense of presence
in your own apps.


143
00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:40.533 line:-1 position:50%
Let's do this exercise together.


144
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,702 line:-1
Imagine you're transported
to a room


145
00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:44.971 line:-1 position:50%
with a physical record player.


146
00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:48.174 line:-1 position:50%
Everyone can go up to it
and interact with it.


147
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:52,145 line:-1
They can put on
their favorite song


148
00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:54.914 line:-1 position:50%
and once it's playing,
anyone else in the room


149
00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.351 line:-1 position:50%
can also go up to the record
player and interact with it.


150
00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:00.253 line:-1 position:50%
They can skip forward
in the song


151
00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:03.590 line:-1 position:50%
or they can skip
the song entirely.


152
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.358 line:-1 position:50%
From this, we found
that we needed


153
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:09,562 line:-1
to offer shared playback
controls in our app.


154
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,133 line:-1
And in fact, it's critical that
we don't put any limitations


155
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,735 line:-1
on who can interact
with these controls.


156
00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:17.704 line:-1 position:50%
We want to create
an engaging experience


157
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,006 line:-1
where everyone feels like
they're able to walk up


158
00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.942 line:-1 position:50%
and control
that same music player.


159
00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:26.279 line:-1 position:50%
OK, now someone has started
playing some music.


160
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.615 line:-1 position:50%
The next thing they might
do is look around


161
00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.917 line:-1 position:50%
and see who's there
listening with them.


162
00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:34.688 line:-1 position:50%
Now this may seem obvious,
but that person may be playing


163
00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:37.357 line:-1 position:50%
their favorite song for someone
and probably wants


164
00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:40.994 line:-1 position:50%
to be reminded of their friend
there listening with them.


165
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,729 line:-1
When people are doing
these experiences


166
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,998 line:-1
through their phones,
we need to find ways


167
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,300 line:-1
to offer reminders
that there are others there


168
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,035 line:-1
doing that experience
with them.


169
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,140 line:-1
This exercise is a great way
to start thinking


170
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.676 line:-1 position:50%
about the design considerations
that will help


171
00:07:56.676 --> 00:08:00.447 line:-1 position:50%
to foster presence in almost
any kind of experience.


172
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,116 line:-1
Now, I'm going to hand it over
to Priya to talk through


173
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:07,287 line:-1
some things to keep in mind
when designing your experience.


174
00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:09.389 line:-1 position:50%
Priya: Thank you, Ryan.


175
00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.891 line:-1 position:50%
When designing
an experience for groups,


176
00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:14.828 line:-1 position:50%
the first thing to think about
is what shared activities


177
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,596 line:-1
your app will support.


178
00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:19.366 line:-1 position:50%
It might be challenging at first
since many apps


179
00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:22.902 line:-1 position:50%
have been designed
with a single person in mind.


180
00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:25.772 line:-1 position:50%
Apps have been personalized
to build engaging experiences


181
00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:27.407 line:-1 position:50%
for individual people


182
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,342 line:-1
but a great personalized
experience


183
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,446 line:-1
might not always translate
to a great group experience.


184
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,249 line:-1
Here is an opportunity for you
to think of your app


185
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,085 line:-1
from a different perspective --
to think of an experience


186
00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:41.454 line:-1 position:50%
designed specifically
for groups.


187
00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:43.022 line:-1 position:50%
When designing your activity,


188
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,959 line:-1
think about what people like
to do when they're together.


189
00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:47.927 line:-1 position:50%
From cooking together
with your friends,


190
00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:49.929 line:-1 position:50%
to breathing
through a yoga flow,


191
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,099 line:-1
watching your favorite team
win the finals


192
00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:56.469 line:-1 position:50%
or gasping at every
"Severance" cliffhanger.


193
00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:58.938 line:-1 position:50%
All of these are good candidates
for SharePlay


194
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,741 line:-1
because they're activities that
people love to do together --


195
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.209 line:-1 position:50%
in person!


196
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,311 line:-1
SharePlay provides
the ability to create


197
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.848 line:-1 position:50%
rich coordinated experiences
for groups where everyone


198
00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:12.318 line:-1 position:50%
has control and shares
the same experience in sync,


199
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,220 line:-1
to help foster
a sense of presence


200
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.922 line:-1 position:50%
when people are apart.


201
00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:19.559 line:-1 position:50%
For example, when using
SharePlay with Apple TV+,


202
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,961 line:-1
pressing play on a video
enables everyone


203
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,363 line:-1
to watch together.


204
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:27,233 position:50%
Everyone's playhead is in sync,
and pause, play, seek commands


205
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,868 position:50%
are all coordinated.


206
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,871 line:0
So when Ryan pauses
or Adam resumes,


207
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:36,075 line:0
the video pauses and plays
for everyone at the same time.


208
00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:38.511 line:-1 position:50%
Apple TV+ is a great example


209
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.214 line:-1 position:50%
of a single-view
coordinated experience,


210
00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:44.851 line:-1 position:50%
where everyone can watch
and listen to the same thing.


211
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:47.020 line:-1 position:50%
If you're building
a coordinated media experience


212
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,757 line:-1
like this for your app, you can
add shared playback controls


213
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.426 line:-1 position:50%
by adopting
AVPlaybackCoordinator


214
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,563 line:-1
and using the
coordinateWithSession method.


215
00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:59.098 line:-1 position:50%
The system will keep everyone
in perfect sync


216
00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:03.169 line:-1 position:50%
as if they were all in the same
room sharing one remote.


217
00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.138 line:-1 position:50%
But sometimes,
we share activities


218
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,640 line:-1
that participants
experience differently.


219
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,477 line:-1
Some participants
might have different views


220
00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:13.213 line:-1 position:50%
of the same coordinated
experience.


221
00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:15.982 line:-1 position:50%
For example, when playing
a game of Heads Up!,


222
00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:18.818 line:-1 position:50%
one person has to guess
the words on the screen


223
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,155 line:-1
while their friends shout out
or act out clues.


224
00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:23.823 line:-1 position:50%
Now, it wouldn't be
a very difficult game


225
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,226 line:-1
if the guessers could see
the answers…


226
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,528 line:-1
so there are two views
in this game,


227
00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:31.931 line:-1 position:50%
and not all participants
see the same view.


228
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,068 line:-1
If you're building a multiview
coordinated experience


229
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,971 line:-1
like this, you can use
the send method


230
00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:41.641 line:-1 position:50%
of the GroupSessionMessenger
class and specify the subsets


231
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,178 line:-1
of the participants that should
receive the message.


232
00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:47.780 line:-1 position:50%
So once you've decided on
the activity you are designing


233
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,883 line:-1
and the views needed
to support it,


234
00:10:49.883 --> 00:10:53.152 line:-1 position:50%
the next step is to build a
great experience for the people


235
00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:55.154 line:-1 position:50%
interacting with your app.


236
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,789 line:-1
Let's discuss some
of the factors


237
00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:58.791 line:-1 position:50%
that can make your app's
SharePlay experience


238
00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:02.128 line:-1 position:50%
intuitive and easy to use.


239
00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:04.898 line:-1 position:50%
In order to build a great
SharePlay experience,


240
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,534 line:-1
it is important to think
through the different stages


241
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:12,005 line:-1
of a shared activity --
starting, during, and ending.


242
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,874 line:-1
We've added the ability
to start a SharePlay session


243
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,510 line:-1
without the need
for an active FaceTime call.


244
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,713 line:-1
So people can start a SharePlay
session directly from your app


245
00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:23.583 line:-1 position:50%
when they come
across content or an activity


246
00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:25.919 line:-1 position:50%
that they want to share
with their friends.


247
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,421 line:-1
This helps bring everyone
directly to the experience


248
00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:31.691 line:-1 position:50%
you've created in your app.


249
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.960 line:-1 position:50%
When people browse your app
and come across something


250
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,695 line:-1
they want to share
with their friends,


251
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:38.798 line:-1 position:50%
they might tap the Share button
to present the Share Sheet.


252
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,701 line:-1
In order to surface the ability
to SharePlay here,


253
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.971 line:-1 position:50%
you can register your app's
group activity by using


254
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,440 line:-1
the registerGroupActivity(_:)
method.


255
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,742 line:-1
People will see the option
to SharePlay the activity


256
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,680 line:-1
from your app directly
from the Share Sheet.


257
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,049 line:-1
In order to make
group activities in your app


258
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.918 line:-1 position:50%
even more discoverable,
you can support the ability


259
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,521 line:-1
to SharePlay directly
in your app's UI


260
00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:03.289 line:-1 position:50%
with the SharePlay button.


261
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,727 line:-1
To do this, you can adopt the
GroupActivitySharingContoller.


262
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.730 line:-1 position:50%
This allows people to start
a SharePlay session,


263
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.032 line:-1 position:50%
select the friends they want
to SharePlay with,


264
00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:15.101 line:-1 position:50%
and whether they want
to SharePlay over messages


265
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.536 line:-1 position:50%
or FaceTime.


266
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,504 line:-1
I'm going to go ahead
and SharePlay some music


267
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,007 line:-1
with Adam and Ryan.


268
00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:22.709 line:-1 position:50%
The system will
display information


269
00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:25.979 line:-1 position:50%
about the group activity
to them, including the title,


270
00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:28.982 line:-1 position:50%
an optional subtitle and image.


271
00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:31.451 line:-1 position:50%
It's important that this
information is descriptive


272
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,053 line:-1
so that Ryan and Adam
know what to expect


273
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,756 line:-1
when they join
the SharePlay session.


274
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,025 line:-1
So be sure to implement
the metadata property


275
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,828 line:-1
for your group activity
with meaningful information


276
00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:45.798 line:-1 position:50%
and return a
GroupActivityMetadata instance.


277
00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:48.668 line:-1 position:50%
Also consider including
a web-based URL


278
00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:51.270 line:-1 position:50%
for participants who might not
have your app installed


279
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.206 line:-1 position:50%
on their device already.


280
00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:55.141 line:-1 position:50%
This will make it quick
and easy for them


281
00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:59.812 line:-1 position:50%
to download your app and join
their friends in the activity.


282
00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:01.314 line:-1 position:50%
It's important to remember


283
00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:03.349 line:-1 position:50%
that just because someone's
on a Messages group


284
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,550 line:-1
or FaceTime call


285
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,021 line:-1
doesn't mean that they have
joined the group activity.


286
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,756 line:-1
To find out who else
is participating


287
00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:11.090 line:-1 position:50%
in the SharePlay session,


288
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.726 line:-1 position:50%
people can navigate
to the details view.


289
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,395 position:50%
Looks like Ryan's
listening with me,


290
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,530 position:50%
but Adam, who's on
the FaceTime call,


291
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,733 line:0
hasn't joined
the SharePlay activity yet.


292
00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:23.503 line:-1 position:50%
When possible, you can also
show similar information


293
00:13:23.503 --> 00:13:25.238 line:-1 position:50%
in your app's UI.


294
00:13:25.238 --> 00:13:26.639 line:-1 position:50%
This is a great way to know


295
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.142 line:-1 position:50%
everyone is on
the same page as you.


296
00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:32.779 line:-1 position:50%
It also helps maintain a sense
of presence with the group.


297
00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:34.280 line:-1 position:50%
If you were all
in the same room,


298
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.515 line:-1 position:50%
you would know
how many people


299
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:39,819 line:-1
were enjoying the activity
with you just by looking around.


300
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,455 line:-1
Now we all have some friends
who are always fashionably late


301
00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:45.358 line:-1 position:50%
to a party; so, depending on
your app's experience,


302
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,493 line:-1
you might want to consider
supporting a lobby


303
00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.362 line:-1 position:50%
where people can wait
for people to join


304
00:13:49.362 --> 00:13:51.431 line:-1 position:50%
before beginning
the experience.


305
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,233 line:0
For example with Heads Up!,
once everyone has joined


306
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,103 position:50%
the SharePlay session,
you can tap Let's Play!


307
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,272 line:0
to start the game.


308
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,808 line:-1
OK, so we've covered
how to make starting


309
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,610 line:-1
and joining a SharePlay
activity seamless.


310
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,747 line:-1
Now let's consider how to create
an intuitive experience


311
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,749 line:-1
during an activity.


312
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,985 line:-1
As part of the ongoing activity,
everyone will be interacting


313
00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:15.488 line:-1 position:50%
with your app
at the same time.


314
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,091 line:-1
We have built a relationship
with our devices


315
00:14:18.091 --> 00:14:19.492 line:-1 position:50%
that changes occur
as a result


316
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,728 line:-1
of us directly
touching something.


317
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,663 line:-1
But when you build
a shared experience


318
00:14:23.663 --> 00:14:25.698 line:-1 position:50%
across different devices,


319
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,168 line:-1
it's possible that things would
change on someone's screen


320
00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:31.571 line:-1 position:50%
due to someone else's
interaction.


321
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:34.574 line:-1 position:50%
So when things change
during a SharePlay session,


322
00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:37.143 line:-1 position:50%
it is important to let
everyone know why.


323
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,612 position:50%
For example,
Ryan might pause the movie


324
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,014 line:0
the group is watching
on his device.


325
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,950 position:50%
When Ryan pauses the video,


326
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,985 line:0
it pauses
for everyone else as well,


327
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,988 position:50%
without any interaction
with their devices.


328
00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:51.891 line:-1 position:50%
The system already handles
communicating changes


329
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,461 line:-1
like these to the rest
of the group with notices


330
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,631 line:-1
but, for some activities,
people may benefit


331
00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:01.300 line:-1 position:50%
from in-app
contextual information


332
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,570 line:-1
about what's going on
during the activity as well.


333
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.738 line:-1 position:50%
For example,


334
00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:08.975 line:-1 position:50%
when using SharePlay
with the Flow app by Moleskin,


335
00:15:08.975 --> 00:15:12.345 line:-1 position:50%
multiple people might be
drawing on the same page.


336
00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:15.748 line:-1 position:50%
When someone draws something,
the app shows the initials


337
00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.617 line:-1 position:50%
of who drew it,
and this makes for


338
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:22,221 line:-1
a much more intuitive experience
for the entire group.


339
00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:24.724 line:-1 position:50%
It also helps reinforce
the feeling of presence


340
00:15:24.724 --> 00:15:26.359 line:-1 position:50%
with the rest of the group.


341
00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:28.628 line:-1 position:50%
This is even more important
now that you can SharePlay


342
00:15:28.628 --> 00:15:31.430 line:-1 position:50%
over Messages, where you may not
have continuous feedback


343
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.300 line:-1 position:50%
from your friends
over audio or video.


344
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.636 line:-1 position:50%
All right, so we've started
a SharePlay activity


345
00:15:36.636 --> 00:15:37.804 line:-1 position:50%
with our friends.


346
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,006 line:-1
We've made sure
everyone has joined.


347
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,309 line:-1
Now, the focus is on
the activity itself.


348
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:46.379 line:-1 position:50%
You might have a fully-immersive
experience that supports


349
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,449 line:-1
full-screen viewing and might be
hiding the status bar.


350
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,187 line:-1
For example, the Apple TV app
hides the status bar


351
00:15:54.187 --> 00:15:55.755 line:-1 position:50%
and other interface elements


352
00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:58.324 line:-1 position:50%
when people are
watching a video


353
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,528 line:-1
but…  it is important to remember
that the pill in the status bar


354
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,599 line:-1
gives people access
to important controls.


355
00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:08.768 line:-1 position:50%
So, let people redisplay
a hidden status bar


356
00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:12.038 line:-1 position:50%
using a simple, discoverable
gesture to give them access


357
00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:15.708 line:-1 position:50%
to these types of controls
during the ongoing activity.


358
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,846 line:-1
In the Apple TV app, a single
tap shows the status bar again


359
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:24,851 line:-1
and reveals important
experience controls in the UI.


360
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:26.519 line:-1 position:50%
It is also important to remember


361
00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:28.387 line:-1 position:50%
that the activity
in your app's interface


362
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,390 line:-1
is only one part
of the whole experience.


363
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.159 line:-1 position:50%
Think about how the people
using your app


364
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,927 line:-1
will engage with
the rest of the group


365
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,129 line:-1
during the SharePlay
experience you've built.


366
00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:40.666 line:-1 position:50%
Whether they are on a FaceTime
call or texting over Messages,


367
00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.535 line:-1 position:50%
people are multitasking


368
00:16:42.535 --> 00:16:45.338 line:-1 position:50%
so there may be instances
when someone navigates away


369
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,674 line:-1
from your app
while in a group activity.


370
00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.978 line:-1 position:50%
For cases like this, remember
to support Picture in Picture


371
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,347 line:-1
for coordinated
media experiences.


372
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,649 line:-1
This will allow everyone
to continue watching


373
00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:57.884 line:-1 position:50%
with their friends,


374
00:16:57.884 --> 00:17:01.954 line:-1 position:50%
maintaining a sense of presence
with the rest of the group.


375
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,123 position:50%
Whether someone is
responding to a message


376
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,392 line:0
or connecting with the group
over FaceTime,


377
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,428 line:0
the video doesn't have
to pause every single time.


378
00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:12.131 line:-1 position:50%
Considerations like these
when building group activities


379
00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:13.532 line:-1 position:50%
for your app
will help make


380
00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:16.402 line:-1 position:50%
the end-to-end SharePlay
experience seamless,


381
00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:18.104 line:-1 position:50%
breaking down
the digital barriers


382
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,940 line:-1
to create meaningful moments
where people feel present


383
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,875 line:-1
with each other.


384
00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:26.078 line:-1 position:50%
So make sure to register
your group activity


385
00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:29.782 line:-1 position:50%
so people can start to SharePlay
directly from your app;


386
00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:33.452 line:-1 position:50%
configure descriptive metadata
so people know what to expect


387
00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:35.288 line:-1 position:50%
when they join the activity;


388
00:17:35.288 --> 00:17:37.623 line:-1 position:50%
have an experience
for late joiners,


389
00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:39.558 line:-1 position:50%
and provide contextual
information


390
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,395 line:-1
about why the UI
might be changing;


391
00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:45.064 line:-1 position:50%
make sure controls
are easy to access;


392
00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:48.601 line:-1 position:50%
and support Picture in Picture
for media.


393
00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:52.638 line:-1 position:50%
We've talked about a lot today,
so let's do a quick recap.


394
00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:55.675 line:-1 position:50%
Now, you can start a SharePlay
session directly from your app


395
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,311 line:-1
without the need
for an ongoing FaceTime call.


396
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,812 line:-1
This expands the opportunities


397
00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.581 line:-1 position:50%
for building a variety
of group activities.


398
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.684 line:-1 position:50%
So we recommend
that you do the portal exercise


399
00:18:04.684 --> 00:18:07.253 line:-1 position:50%
to start thinking about
how to design an experience


400
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,221 line:-1
for your app
that helps people feel


401
00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:11.724 line:-1 position:50%
like they're in
the same space together;


402
00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:14.360 line:-1 position:50%
reimagine your app's
content and activities


403
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,430 line:-1
to create great experiences
for groups;


404
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,199 line:-1
and use best practices
when building your experience


405
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,369 line:-1
to prevent digital barriers
from getting in the way.


406
00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:25.604 line:-1 position:50%
We cannot wait to see
the creative uses of SharePlay


407
00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:26.939 line:-1 position:50%
that you all come up with.


408
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,641 line:-1
We hope you enjoyed the session.


409
00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:30.242 line:-1 position:50%
Adam and Priya:
