00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.315 line:-1 position:50%
Hi, there!


6
00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.551 line:-1 position:50%
I'm Paul, and I work
on the SF Symbols app.


7
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,752 line:-1
Today, we're going to talk about


8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,955 line:-1
a brand-new feature of SF
Symbols: Variable Color.


9
00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.524 line:-1 position:50%
We'll be going over how to bring
symbols with Variable Color


10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,094 line:-1
into your projects,
and how the SF Symbols app


11
00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:30.264 line:-1 position:50%
can help you with every step
along the way.


12
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,032 line:-1
First, we'll take a look
at Variable Color


13
00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.101 line:-1 position:50%
in system-provided SF Symbols.


14
00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:37.838 line:-1 position:50%
We'll go over how it works
and when to use it.


15
00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:40.007 line:-1 position:50%
Then, we'll go over
how to bring Variable Color


16
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.010 line:-1 position:50%
into your own custom symbols.


17
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,279 line:1
Before we get started,
if this is your first time


18
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,948 position:50%
using SF Symbols,
or if you just want a refresher,


19
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,883 position:50%
I recommend you watch
last year's session,


20
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,853 position:50%
"Explore the SF Symbols 3 app,"
to find out more about


21
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,822 line:1
how to find and organize
symbols for your projects.


22
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,425 position:50%
And if you haven't yet,
check out Thalia's talk,


23
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,028 position:50%
"What's new in SF Symbols 4,"
for an overview


24
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,063 position:50%
of the visual design
of SF Symbols


25
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,366 position:50%
and the different rendering
modes we'll be showing today.


26
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,836 line:-1
Now, let's talk
about Variable Color.


27
00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:13.140 line:-1 position:50%
Variable Color is a new feature
of SF Symbols that allows you


28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,311 line:-1
to affect the appearance of a
symbol using a percentage value.


29
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:19.279 line:-1 position:50%
By changing
this percentage value,


30
00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.748 line:-1 position:50%
you can easily create symbols
that reflect values


31
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:26.420 line:-1 position:50%
that can change over time, like
signal strength or progress.


32
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.189 line:-1 position:50%
I think the best way to see
how Variable Color works


33
00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.091 line:-1 position:50%
is to jump into
the SF Symbols app


34
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,260 line:-1
and let the system
speak for itself.


35
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,195 line:-1
This year
in the SF Symbols app,


36
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,298 line:-1
we added a new preview area
here in the rendering inspector


37
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,901 line:-1
that allows you to see a symbol
in every rendering mode


38
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.436 line:-1 position:50%
at a glance.


39
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,105 line:-1
You can also click on
the different representations


40
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.041 line:-1 position:50%
to switch between
rendering modes.


41
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,745 line:-1
There's also a new Automatic
option here in the picker.


42
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,647 line:-1
This option allows each symbol


43
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,249 line:-1
to choose its own
preferred rendering mode,


44
00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.453 line:-1 position:50%
which you can see selected
in the preview area here.


45
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,389 line:-1
For example, this
square.and.arrow.up symbol


46
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,192 line:-1
prefers Monochrome,
while these iPhone symbols


47
00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:08.028 line:-1 position:50%
prefer Hierarchical.


48
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,297 line:-1
Below the color controls,
you'll find a new set


49
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,766 line:-1
of controls for Variable Color.


50
00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.301 line:-1 position:50%
And there's a new category


51
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:16.503 line:-1 position:50%
for symbols that support
Variable Color,


52
00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:19.373 line:-1 position:50%
which is a great place
to start experimenting.


53
00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:23.010 line:-1 position:50%
Let's select this speaker
symbol, switch to Multicolor,


54
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,646 line:-1
and switch to the gallery view
to get a closer look.


55
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,382 line:-1
I'll start by clicking
this button


56
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,284 line:-1
to turn Variable Color on,
and pull the slider


57
00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:34.521 line:-1 position:50%
all the way down to decrease
the percentage we're using.


58
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.990 line:-1 position:50%
You can see pieces
of the symbol dimming


59
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.892 line:-1 position:50%
as the percentage value
decreases.


60
00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:41.161 line:-1 position:50%
And as I pull
the slider back up,


61
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.898 line:-1 position:50%
those pieces of the symbol
regain all of their color.


62
00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.933 line:-1 position:50%
If you keep an eye
on the preview area,


63
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,337 line:-1
you can see this happening
in all four rendering modes.


64
00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.639 line:-1 position:50%
And if I switch
back to grid view,


65
00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.475 line:-1 position:50%
you can see all of the symbols
in the Variable category


66
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,678 line:-1
are reacting to the changes.


67
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,249 line:-1
So what did we just learn
about Variable Color?


68
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,052 line:-1
First off,
Variable Color can be used


69
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:09,322 line:-1
with every single rendering mode
available for SF Symbols.


70
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,591 line:-1
Every system symbol
that supports Variable Color


71
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.795 line:-1 position:50%
supports it in Monochrome,
Hierarchical, Palette,


72
00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:17.230 line:-1 position:50%
and Multicolor modes.


73
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.801 line:-1 position:50%
Second, there are no rules
for how many parts of a symbol


74
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.403 line:-1 position:50%
can be affected
by Variable Color.


75
00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:26.306 line:-1 position:50%
Some symbols only have
one layer that's affected;


76
00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.874 line:-1 position:50%
some have dozens.


77
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,043 line:-1
Regardless,
because Variable Color


78
00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.112 line:-1 position:50%
is controlled using percentages,


79
00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:34.081 line:-1 position:50%
you don't need
to worry about this.


80
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:37,184 line:-1
Just pass in a percentage
and you're good to go.


81
00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:39.986 line:-1 position:50%
So how does the system
interpret those percentages?


82
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,255 line:-1
How do we know
when a particular layer


83
00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.925 line:-1 position:50%
is going to have
Variable Color applied?


84
00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:47.294 line:-1 position:50%
Well, like the rest
of SF Symbols,


85
00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:49.496 line:-1 position:50%
we designed Variable Color
to make your apps


86
00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:52.332 line:-1 position:50%
feel right at home
on Apple platforms.


87
00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:55.001 line:-1 position:50%
And that means that we took
inspiration from the behavior


88
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:58.805 line:-1 position:50%
of system-level indicators
that you might be familiar with.


89
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,875 line:-1
Let's look at this microphone
symbol as an example.


90
00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:04.811 line:-1 position:50%
The four dots on the left side
of the microphone are each


91
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,982 line:-1
in a separate layer that
participates in Variable Color.


92
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,586 line:-1
So, each dot will activate
when the percentage value


93
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.921 line:-1 position:50%
crosses a certain threshold.


94
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,424 position:50%
Those thresholds
are spaced out evenly


95
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,527 line:1
between zero and 100 percent.


96
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:25,365 line:1
Zero percent is a special case
where no layers will be active.


97
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,367 line:1
Any value
greater than zero percent


98
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,669 position:50%
will activate the first dot.


99
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,671 line:1
At 26 percent and greater,


100
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,941 line:1
the second dot
will also be activated.


101
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,911 line:1
Fifty-one percent and greater
will activate the third dot.


102
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:42,883 position:50%
And 76 up through 100 percent
will activate all four dots.


103
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:46,019 position:50%
So, Variable Color symbols
will only appear


104
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,956 position:50%
visually empty
at exactly zero percent.


105
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,726 position:50%
You can see this behavior
in system-level indicators


106
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,563 position:50%
like Wi-Fi strength
and battery level.


107
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,633 line:1
Variable Color symbols will
start appearing visually full


108
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,402 line:1
at a value
less than 100 percent.


109
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,272 position:50%
You can see this behavior
in system-level indicators


110
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,774 line:1
like brightness and volume.


111
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,945 line:-1
Now, this next symbol has three
layers that use Variable Color,


112
00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:14.414 line:-1 position:50%
which means that the thresholds
between layers might fall


113
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:20,620 line:-1
at awkward values like
33.3333 and 66.6667 percent.


114
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.256 line:-1 position:50%
We didn't want rounding errors
to make symbols appear in


115
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,993 line:-1
unexpected ways, and we didn't
want you to have to worry about


116
00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.896 line:-1 position:50%
how many significant digits
you typed into your code.


117
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,065 line:-1
So, thresholds between layers


118
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,001 line:-1
are rounded to the nearest
percentage point,


119
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.836 line:-1 position:50%
and we don't activate
the next layer


120
00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:41.708 line:-1 position:50%
until you're one full percentage
point above that rounded value.


121
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,645 line:1
So, for the first threshold,
33.3 percent rounds down


122
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,215 position:50%
to 33 percent,
so the second layer


123
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:52,519 position:50%
activates one percentage point
higher at 34 percent.


124
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:58,191 position:50%
The final threshold rounds from
66.7 percent up to 67 percent,


125
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,094 line:1
so the last layer activates
at one percentage point


126
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,431 position:50%
higher than that, at 68 percent.


127
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,266 line:-1
Of course,
system-provided symbols


128
00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:08.568 line:-1 position:50%
are only one half of the story.


129
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,104 line:-1
With the SF Symbols app,
you can make and annotate


130
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,940 line:-1
your own custom symbols,
and even better,


131
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.810 line:-1 position:50%
you can make your custom
symbols just as flexible


132
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,181 line:-1
and just as powerful as symbols
provided by the system.


133
00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:23.383 line:-1 position:50%
What do I mean
by flexible and powerful?


134
00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:26.519 line:-1 position:50%
Well, system-provided
SF Symbols are available


135
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,390 line:-1
in nine different weights, and
each one of those nine weights


136
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.260 line:-1 position:50%
is available at three
different scales.


137
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,763 line:-1
Each one of those
27 variants is available


138
00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:41.101 line:-1 position:50%
in four rendering modes
with and without Variable Color.


139
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:45,205 line:-1
That's 216 possible
configurations.


140
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,207 line:-1
Luckily, that doesn't mean
that you need to draw


141
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:51,077 line:-1
your custom symbols 216 times.


142
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,014 line:-1
Last year, to streamline
the process of drawing symbols,


143
00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:56.349 line:-1 position:50%
we introduced
variable templates.


144
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,984 line:-1
When using
this kind of template,


145
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,354 line:-1
instead of drawing 27 different
combinations of weights


146
00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:04.291 line:-1 position:50%
and scales,
you only need to draw three,


147
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:08,995 line:-1
and the system can generate the
other 24 for you automatically.


148
00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:11.131 line:-1 position:50%
After you've drawn
your custom symbol,


149
00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:12.999 line:-1 position:50%
you can adopt
different rendering modes


150
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,536 line:-1
through a process
we call "annotation."


151
00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:18.605 line:-1 position:50%
Last year, if you wanted
your symbol to adopt


152
00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.574 line:-1 position:50%
the Hierarchical
and Palette rendering modes,


153
00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:24.878 line:-1 position:50%
you broke your custom symbol
into different layers


154
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:28,281 line:-1
and assigned each layer
a hierarchy level.


155
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.916 line:-1 position:50%
If you wanted
your symbol to adopt


156
00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:34.054 line:-1 position:50%
the multicolor rendering mode,
you broke your custom symbol


157
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:38,892 line:-1
into different layers again and
assigned a color to each layer.


158
00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:42.028 line:-1 position:50%
This meant that, to support all
the available rendering modes,


159
00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:46.232 line:-1 position:50%
you had to manage
two separate layer structures.


160
00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.635 line:-1 position:50%
This year,
we're streamlining that workflow


161
00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.670 line:-1 position:50%
with unified annotation.


162
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,807 line:-1
Unified annotation uses
a single-layer structure


163
00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:55.709 line:-1 position:50%
for a symbol,
and shares that structure


164
00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:57.944 line:-1 position:50%
across all rendering modes.


165
00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:00.747 line:-1 position:50%
So, instead of having to break
your symbol into layers


166
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:05,151 line:-1
multiple times,
you only need to do it once.


167
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,121 line:-1
You now also have control
over how your symbol will look


168
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:09.989 line:-1 position:50%
in Monochrome rendering mode,


169
00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:12.292 line:-1 position:50%
in addition to the previous
control you had


170
00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:15.995 line:-1 position:50%
over Hierarchical, Palette,
and Multicolor.


171
00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.932 line:-1 position:50%
And of course,
unified annotation allows you


172
00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:22.135 line:-1 position:50%
to add Variable Color
to your symbols.


173
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,437 line:-1
So let's work on annotating
a custom symbol


174
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,207 line:-1
to get to know
unified annotation.


175
00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:28.975 line:-1 position:50%
Last year, I was working
on an app


176
00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:30.977 line:-1 position:50%
so my family could play
card games together,


177
00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:33.346 line:-1 position:50%
even when we couldn't be
in the same room.


178
00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.815 line:-1 position:50%
A few months after that,
I discovered a new obsession:


179
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,283 line:-1
puzzle cubes!


180
00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:39.052 line:-1 position:50%
So this year,
I want to make an app


181
00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:42.689 line:-1 position:50%
that's going to help me
practice solving mine.


182
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,491 line:-1
I've got a custom
puzzle cube symbol


183
00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:46.526 line:-1 position:50%
that I've made
here on my desktop.


184
00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.596 line:-1 position:50%
I'll drag it into the app
to make a new custom symbol.


185
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:52,999 line:1
I based this symbol off of the
system-provided cube symbol,


186
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,368 position:50%
and notice how I've left
some of the details


187
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,070 line:1
of the puzzle cube out.


188
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.172 line:-1 position:50%
This helps the symbol
come across clearly,


189
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:02,542 line:-1
even at small sizes
and different weights.


190
00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.911 line:-1 position:50%
Now, remember this preview area
from before?


191
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,515 line:-1
It's especially handy when
annotating custom symbols.


192
00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:10.650 line:-1 position:50%
As I make changes
to the annotation,


193
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.585 line:-1 position:50%
I can see how
my custom symbol looks


194
00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:15.655 line:-1 position:50%
in all the different
rendering modes at a glance.


195
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,625 line:-1
And when I switch
rendering modes by clicking here


196
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,960 line:-1
or picking a different
option in the picker,


197
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,532 line:-1
the annotation controls
in the list change accordingly.


198
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,200 line:-1
Monochrome looks pretty good,


199
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.336 line:-1 position:50%
but let's add some depth
in Hierarchical mode.


200
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,939 position:50%
I'll switch to that mode
and pull the top


201
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,642 line:1
and the side of the cube into new layers.


202
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,477 line:1
You can see
that these new layers


203
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,179 position:50%
automatically get switched


204
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,682 position:50%
to the less-prominent
secondary and tertiary levels.


205
00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:44.984 line:-1 position:50%
This gives my symbol
a little bit more depth


206
00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:46.786 line:-1 position:50%
and visual interest.


207
00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:49.422 line:-1 position:50%
And remember
that the Hierarchical annotation


208
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,593 line:-1
that we create is also used to
support Palette rendering mode.


209
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,129 line:-1
So I've just gotten
two new rendering modes


210
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,364 line:-1
for the price of one.


211
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,567 line:-1
Now, let's switch over
to Multicolor mode


212
00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:02.335 line:-1 position:50%
to give this symbol some color.


213
00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:05.438 line:-1 position:50%
Notice that when I switch
to Multicolor mode,


214
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,141 line:-1
I still see the same layers
that I separated out


215
00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:09.676 line:-1 position:50%
in Hierarchical mode.


216
00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:12.045 line:-1 position:50%
Remember,
in unified annotation,


217
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,148 line:-1
changes made to the layer
structure in one rendering mode


218
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,717 line:-1
will carry through
to all the others.


219
00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:22.255 line:-1 position:50%
Let's make the front face red,
the top face blue,


220
00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:25.091 line:-1 position:50%
and the side face yellow.


221
00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:27.126 line:-1 position:50%
All right,
this looks pretty great.


222
00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:30.697 line:-1 position:50%
But the most important part of
learning to solve a puzzle cube


223
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:34,334 line:-1
is practice, practice,
and more practice.


224
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:37,604 line:-1
So, I would love to use
my cube symbol as a timer,


225
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:41,441 line:-1
and have it fill up with color
as I spend more time practicing.


226
00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:45.612 line:-1 position:50%
The solution for that
is Variable Color.


227
00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:47.747 line:-1 position:50%
These separate pieces
in the front face


228
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,816 line:-1
look like a great place
to add some variable color


229
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,384 line:-1
for our timer.


230
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,186 line:1
Let's separate out
each of these pieces


231
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,889 position:50%
into a different layer.


232
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,790 line:1
Notice the order
that I'm arranging these


233
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,325 line:1
in the layer list.


234
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,662 position:50%
The layers that I want to
fill in first go on the bottom,


235
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:08,067 line:1
and the layers I want
to fill in last go on top.


236
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:12,272 position:50%
Then, we'll select all of these
layers and click on this button,


237
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,441 position:50%
which will enable Variable Color
on all of them.


238
00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:16.476 line:-1 position:50%
And that's it!


239
00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:18.478 line:-1 position:50%
Let's move the Variable Color
slider around


240
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,914 line:-1
to see what happens.


241
00:11:20.914 --> 00:11:22.916 line:-1 position:50%
Remember to keep an eye
on the preview area


242
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,152 line:-1
to see what's happening in all
the different rendering modes.


243
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,153 line:-1
You can see that,


244
00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:29.889 line:-1 position:50%
as we change the percentage
used in Variable Color,


245
00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:34.394 line:-1 position:50%
the front face adjusts its color
in every rendering mode.


246
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,996 line:-1
That's the power
of unified annotation.


247
00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:39.098 line:-1 position:50%
Because edits
in one rendering mode


248
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,401 line:-1
can carry through
to other rendering modes.


249
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,337 line:-1
In many cases, you only need
to do work once or twice


250
00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:47.974 line:-1 position:50%
to get great results
in all four rendering modes.


251
00:11:47.974 --> 00:11:50.476 line:-1 position:50%
And in situations where
things are a bit trickier,


252
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,979 line:-1
the SF Symbols app
still has you covered.


253
00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:56.749 line:-1 position:50%
Let's look at a more
complicated symbol.


254
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,519 line:-1
Here's my cube symbol again,
but this time,


255
00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.087 line:-1 position:50%
it's set inside of a circle,


256
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:05,758 line:-1
like many of the .circle.fill
symbols in the system library.


257
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,461 line:1
Now, I've already started
annotating this symbol.


258
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,697 line:1
You can see here
that I've separated the circle


259
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,099 position:50%
and the parts of the cube
into different layers.


260
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,234 line:-1
My symbol looks great
in Multicolor


261
00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:17.236 line:-1 position:50%
and Hierarchical modes,


262
00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.839 line:-1 position:50%
but in Monochrome,
there's not much contrast


263
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,910 line:-1
between the cube
and the circle behind it.


264
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,813 line:-1
When all the paths in
the symbol were in one layer,


265
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,682 line:-1
the cube paths created
holes in the circle path,


266
00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:33.553 line:-1 position:50%
which looked great
in Monochrome.


267
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:36,990 line:-1
But now that I've moved
the circle onto its own layer,


268
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.760 line:-1 position:50%
the cube paths
no longer create holes.


269
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.331 line:-1 position:50%
Instead, they create a solid
cube on top of a solid circle.


270
00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:48.701 line:-1 position:50%
So we can't see it very well.


271
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,638 line:-1
Luckily, there's a new feature
of unified annotation


272
00:12:51.638 --> 00:12:54.540 line:-1 position:50%
that can help us here.


273
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,942 line:1
We can choose Erase


274
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,779 position:50%
to make a layer create a hole
in the layers behind it.


275
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.147 line:-1 position:50%
That's looking much better.


276
00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:03.916 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let's add
Variable Color again.


277
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,919 line:-1
This time, I'll just select all
of the pieces of the front face


278
00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:11.624 line:-1 position:50%
and choose
Split into New Layers


279
00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.559 line:-1 position:50%
from the contextual menu.


280
00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:18.464 line:-1 position:50%
Then I'll use this button
to turn on Variable Color again.


281
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.199 line:-1 position:50%
And I'm done!


282
00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.035 line:-1 position:50%
And by the way,
the paths are split up


283
00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:25.071 line:-1 position:50%
using the order that they appear
in your symbol template,


284
00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:27.907 line:-1 position:50%
so if you pay attention to the
order of your symbol's paths


285
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,444 line:-1
as you're drawing,
you can save some time later.


286
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:35,081 line:-1
So that is unified annotation
in a nutshell.


287
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:39,419 line:-1
It's a fast and powerful way
to annotate your custom symbols.


288
00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:41.120 line:-1 position:50%
You create one layer structure


289
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,290 line:-1
that applies across
all rendering modes.


290
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,726 line:-1
You can now control
the appearance of your symbol


291
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,629 line:-1
in Monochrome rendering mode.


292
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:52.231 line:-1 position:50%
You can add Variable Color
to individual layers


293
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,966 line:-1
in your symbol.


294
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,536 line:-1
The z-order of the layers
determines the order


295
00:13:56,536 --> 00:14:00,306 line:-1
that they will fill in as the
passed-in percentage increases,


296
00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:03.376 line:-1 position:50%
and the thresholds used
for each layer are spaced evenly


297
00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:06.479 line:-1 position:50%
between zero and 100 percent.


298
00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:09.215 line:-1 position:50%
And because it's part
of the layer structure,


299
00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:12.018 line:-1 position:50%
when a layer opts in
to Variable Color,


300
00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:15.855 line:-1 position:50%
this setting is shared
across all rendering modes.


301
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:19.392 line:-1 position:50%
And there are two new layer
options in unified annotation


302
00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:23.329 line:-1 position:50%
that make it easier to work with
the new shared layer structure.


303
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,666 line:-1
Setting a layer to Erase
will use that layer's shape


304
00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:28.935 line:-1 position:50%
to erase layers behind it.


305
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:32,171 line:-1
This is really useful in
situations like Monochrome


306
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,541 line:-1
and Hierarchical symbols
that have badges with a plus,


307
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:38.578 line:-1 position:50%
a minus, or some other shape
inside of them.


308
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,281 line:-1
And finally, setting a layer
to Hidden will exclude it


309
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:44.250 line:-1 position:50%
from a particular
rendering mode.


310
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.420 line:-1 position:50%
If you're in a situation where
a layer truly can't be used


311
00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.456 line:-1 position:50%
across all the rendering modes,
you can use this option


312
00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:54.894 line:-1 position:50%
to only apply that layer
to certain modes.


313
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,028 line:-1
All of these new features


314
00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:59.699 line:-1 position:50%
are supported
by a new template format, 4.0.


315
00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:02.401 line:-1 position:50%
When you're exporting a symbol
from the SF Symbols app


316
00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:06.439 line:-1 position:50%
to import into Xcode, make sure
that you export a 4.0 template


317
00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:10.943 line:-1 position:50%
to control Monochrome rendering
and use Variable Color.


318
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,578 line:-1
If you already
have custom symbols


319
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,281 line:-1
that you annotated last year,
they will be automatically


320
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,850 line:-1
updated to use
unified annotation.


321
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.120 line:-1 position:50%
Your Hierarchical and Multicolor
annotations will be brought in


322
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,624 line:-1
with no extra work
required from you.


323
00:15:24.624 --> 00:15:27.193 line:-1 position:50%
And, if you need to support
earlier platforms,


324
00:15:27.193 --> 00:15:32.865 line:-1 position:50%
the previous 3.0 and 2.0 formats
are still available for use.


325
00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:35.768 line:-1 position:50%
Before we wrap up, there's
one more thing I want to do.


326
00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:38.738 line:-1 position:50%
I've had a lot of fun learning
about how to solve puzzle cubes,


327
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,908 line:-1
but the best part so far
is that my daughter


328
00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:44.443 line:-1 position:50%
saw me solving them
and wanted to learn too.


329
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:48,514 line:-1
So naturally, I also want her
to be able to use my app


330
00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:50.082 line:-1 position:50%
to help her practice.


331
00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.984 line:-1 position:50%
Now, she's starting
kindergarten this fall,


332
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,555 line:-1
so we're going to start
her off a little slower.


333
00:15:55,555 --> 00:16:00,059 line:-1
But this is where symbols
with Variable Color truly shine.


334
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,129 line:-1
We could design
our timer UI like this.


335
00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:06.265 line:-1 position:50%
Text and numbers are
descriptive and helpful,


336
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,135 line:-1
but they could be intimidating
for someone like her


337
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:13.239 line:-1 position:50%
who's still learning
or is unable to read the text.


338
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,875 line:-1
But seeing a puzzle cube
that looks just like the one


339
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,110 line:-1
she's holding,
and seeing it fill up


340
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:22.782 line:-1 position:50%
with color as time passes,
is friendly and intuitive.


341
00:16:22.782 --> 00:16:25.084 line:-1 position:50%
I don't even need
to change my timer code;


342
00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:28.354 line:-1 position:50%
all I need to do is change
the name of the symbol I'm using


343
00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:31.224 line:-1 position:50%
and keep passing in the same
percentage values I used


344
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,159 line:-1
for my bigger cube symbol,


345
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,828 line:-1
and SF Symbols
takes care of the rest.


346
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,930 line:-1
And that's the power of symbols.


347
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,999 line:-1
They allow us to convey
ideas in a way


348
00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.535 line:-1 position:50%
that transcends
language and text.


349
00:16:42.535 --> 00:16:45.671 line:-1 position:50%
They give us a way to make
our apps more inclusive.


350
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,541 line:-1
And Variable Color in both
system-provided symbols


351
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,278 line:-1
and your custom symbols gives us
even more expressive power


352
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,215 line:-1
for concepts like progress,
signal strength, and time.


353
00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:58.251 line:-1 position:50%
All of that
from three drawings


354
00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:00.186 line:-1 position:50%
and one unified annotation.


355
00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.854 line:-1 position:50%
That's pretty amazing.


356
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,056 line:-1
And, I might add,
it's way easier


357
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,058 line:-1
than solving a puzzle cube.
