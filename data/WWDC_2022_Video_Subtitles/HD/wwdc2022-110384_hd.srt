Hi, my name is Felipe.


4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:14,081 line:-1
I'm a software engineer on the tvOS team.


5
00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:18.652 line:-2 align:center
Today I'm excited to share with you
the improvements we've made in tvOS 16


6
00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:22.623 line:-2 align:center
to make it easier to support
multiple users in your apps.


7
00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:26.460 line:-2 align:center
Apple TV is designed to be used
by everyone.


8
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:31,899 line:-2
We've been improving multiple users
on Apple TV since tvOS 13.


9
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:35,802 line:-2
In tvOS 16 we have new features
that will make it easier


10
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,872 line:-1
to support multiple users in all apps.


11
00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:43.243 line:-2 align:center
I'll start with an overview of
the multiple users features on Apple TV.


12
00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:48.582 line:-2 align:center
Showing how easy it is personalize apps
on a device used by everyone.


13
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:53,187 line:-2
Then I'll demonstrate how simple it is
to store the profile selection


14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.490 line:-1 align:center
for each user of a streaming app.


15
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,827 line:-2
Finishing with recommendations
for the best approach for your own app.


16
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:05.799 line:-2 align:center
In tvOS 16 we are making it easier
to have the entire family on Apple TV.


17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.903 line:-2 align:center
When you press and hold the TV button
on your Siri Remote,


18
00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.339 line:-1 align:center
Control Center shows up.


19
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,844 line:-2
At the top is the list of users
that are on this Apple TV.


20
00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:18.812 line:-1 align:center
New in tvOS 16,


21
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:21,648 line:-2
the list of users includes
iCloud Family members


22
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,450 line:-1
that haven't been added yet,


23
00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:27.654 line:-2 align:center
making it easier than ever
to have the entire family on Apple TV.


24
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,526 line:-1
Here, Anne isn't on the Apple TV yet.


25
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,863 line:-1
The plus icon indicates a suggested user.


26
00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:40.033 line:-2 align:center
To have Anne join,
we can simply select the suggested user.


27
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:48,542 line:-2
All Anne needs to do is bring their iPhone
to the same room as the Apple TV,


28
00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:52.646 line:-2 align:center
and on the iPhone confirm
the connection.


29
00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.348 line:-1 align:center
And that is all.


30
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,485 line:-2
Anne has now access
to their data on Apple TV.


31
00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:02.756 line:-2 align:center
Now let's go back to Anne's iPhone
for a moment.


32
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,059 line:-2
Let's take a look at Anne's
favorite video streaming app.


33
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,695 line:-1
The app is used by the entire family


34
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,165 line:-1
and each person has their own profile.


35
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,802 line:-2
When the app first launches,
it presents a profile picker,


36
00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:18.539 line:-1 align:center
Anne picks her profile.


37
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,475 line:-1
The app, running on a personal device,


38
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:25,979 line:-2
can simply store the preferred profile
in NSUserDefaults,


39
00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:30.350 line:-2 align:center
or even put in CloudKit
to have it synced to all devices.


40
00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.888 line:-1 align:center
The iPhone of each member of the family


41
00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:38.058 line:-2 align:center
remembers
that person's preferred profile.


42
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:42.896 line:-2 align:center
There is no need to keep asking
which profile to use when the app opens.


43
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,999 line:-2
Apple TV is a device shared
by the entire family,


44
00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:50.404 line:-2 align:center
and we think it is really important
that everyone who uses Apple TV


45
00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:54.007 line:-2 align:center
is able to access
their own content and data.


46
00:02:54.575 --> 00:03:01.315 line:-2 align:center
In tvOS 14 we introduced the ability
for apps to run as the current user.


47
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:05,219 line:-2
With a single checkbox to add
the "Runs as Current User" entitlement,


48
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,454 line:-1
and no code changes at all,


49
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:12,292 line:-2
apps can access each user's own data,
just like on iPhone.


50
00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:22.102 line:-2 align:center
Your iOS code, calling those APIs,
can run as is on Apple TV,


51
00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:27.174 line:-2 align:center
behaving like each person
is using their own personal Apple TV.


52
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,844 line:-2
When the app launches,
tvOS takes care of everything.


53
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,982 line:-2
Privacy and security,
all handled by the system.


54
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,752 line:-2
The "runs as current user" entitlement
is perfect for games


55
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:43,557 line:-2
and any apps that are all
about individual progress.


56
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,794 line:-2
Media apps with profiles, though,
need a little bit more.


57
00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:52.232 line:-2 align:center
In my example so far,
I skipped an important part: the sign-in.


58
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:58,872 line:-2
We believe signing in needs to be
as easy and infrequent as possible.


59
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:03,944 line:-2
In tvOS 15 we introduced a feature
that allows people to use their iPhone


60
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:09,550 line:-2
or iPad to seamlessly sign in
on your tvOS apps.


61
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,019 line:-1
It is a first-class sign-in experience,


62
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,154 line:-1
where the devices work together


63
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:18,492 line:-2
to offer the most convenient way
to sign in on Apple TV.


64
00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:21.495 line:-2 align:center
Features not directly available
on Apple TV,


65
00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:25.933 line:-2 align:center
like your passwords in iCloud Keychain,
are just a tap away.


66
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,069 align:center
To learn how to build
great sign-in experiences,


67
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:34,741 line:0
watch "Simplify sign-in for
your tvOS apps" from WWDC 2021.


68
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,546 line:-2
And this year
we're introducing support for OAuth


69
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.049 line:-1 align:center
and passkeys on tvOS.


70
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,152 line:-2
Passkeys are an awesome
new authentication technology


71
00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:48.722 line:-2 align:center
for replacing passwords
in your apps and websites.


72
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:53,894 line:0
To learn more about passkeys,
watch the "Meet Passkeys" video.


73
00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:57.431 line:-1 align:center
But ease and convenience isn't all.


74
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,568 line:-2
It is still important
to have sign-in happen only once.


75
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:05,506 line:-2
To achieve this optimal user experience,
with "Runs as Current User,"


76
00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.910 line:-2 align:center
we're introducing
a simple new API in tvOS 16.


77
00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:12.913 line:-1 align:center
It is a new constant in Keychain Services


78
00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:17.484 line:-2 align:center
that allows apps to access
a user-independent Keychain.


79
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:23,423 line:-2
Items stored using this new key are always
accessible by all users on Apple TV.


80
00:05:23.457 --> 00:05:26.293 line:-1 align:center
Let's look at an example.


81
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:30.163 line:-2 align:center
Here is a method that saves
an item in the Keychain,


82
00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:33.367 line:-1 align:center
with username and password.


83
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,403 line:-2
To save the item
to the user-independent Keychain,


84
00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:40.440 line:-2 align:center
all you have to do is add a new key to the
attributes dictionary


85
00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:43.810 line:-1 align:center
that is passed to the function SecItemAdd.


86
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:49,850 line:-2
We simply pass true as the value for
the key kSecUseUserIndependentKeychain.


87
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,353 line:-1
With the user-independent Keychain set,


88
00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:58.458 line:-2 align:center
the items you read and write
will be visible to all users.


89
00:05:58.492 --> 00:06:01.528 line:-2 align:center
The combination of both
the new Keychain API


90
00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:03.664 line:-1 align:center
and "Runs as Current User" entitlement


91
00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:08.335 line:-2 align:center
allows your apps to have the best
of iPhone and the best of Apple TV:


92
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:12.272 line:-2 align:center
simple per-user data separation
on a shared device


93
00:06:12.306 --> 00:06:16.677 line:-2 align:center
while maintaining
the single sign-in experience on Apple TV.


94
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,615 line:-2
In tvOS 16 we've deprecated
the methods to manually map profiles


95
00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:24.618 line:-1 align:center
to system users in TVUserManager.


96
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:29.189 line:-2 align:center
There is no need for you to maintain
a map of users to profiles anymore.


97
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,325 line:-1
The system will handle it for you.


98
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:36,763 line:-2
The same APIs you use on iOS can be used,
as is, on Apple TV.


99
00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:39.800 line:-1 align:center
It is so much easier.


100
00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:42.436 line:-2 align:center
Let me show you it all
in action with a demo.


101
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:47,274 line:-2
I'll walk you through a sample app
that represents media apps with profiles.


102
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,978 line:-1
This is my streaming video app.


103
00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:55.315 line:-2 align:center
Currently it doesn't use any
of the features I talked about.


104
00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:00,821 line:-2
It doesn't run as the current user,
and it doesn't use the new Keychain API.


105
00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:04.124 line:-1 align:center
I'll go ahead and sign in to show you.


106
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,531 line:-2
After sign-in
I'm presented with a list of profiles.


107
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:14,001 line:-2
The current user is Mei,
so I'll pick her profile.


108
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,807 line:-2
Picking a profile shows the personalized
contents Mei wants to see.


109
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:26,680 line:-1
Later, Anne sits on the couch to watch TV.


110
00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:29.082 line:-1 align:center
They open Control Center


111
00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:32.486 line:-2 align:center
by long pressing the TV button
on the Siri Remote.


112
00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:37.457 line:-2 align:center
Here at the top in Control Center
is the list of users.


113
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:40,627 line:-2
The green checkmark indicates
the current user.


114
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:43.897 line:-2 align:center
I'm going to switch to Anne now
and open the app.


115
00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:49.269 line:-2 align:center
As expected,
the app presents the profile picker again.


116
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,905 line:-1
So Anne can select their profile.


117
00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:57.945 line:-2 align:center
But watch what happens
when switching back to Mei.


118
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,651 line:-1
The app stays in Anne's profile.


119
00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:08.856 line:-2 align:center
It doesn't remember that Mei
had picked her preferred profile before.


120
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,525 line:-1
With the new features in tvOS 16,


121
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,228 line:-1
the user experience can be much better.


122
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:19.166 line:-2 align:center
I want people using the app to not
have to select again who is watching.


123
00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:22.769 line:-2 align:center
Let's go to Xcode,
and I'll show you how easy it is.


124
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:27,074 line:-2
Making my app executes
as the current user is simple.


125
00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:31.612 line:-2 align:center
All I have to do is add one capability
to my app's target.


126
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,614 line:-1
Here in my app's target,


127
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:37,451 line:-2
I'll go over
to the Signing & Capabilities tab.


128
00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:40.254 line:-1 align:center
Just under the tab, on the top left here,


129
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,757 line:-1
I'll click the Add Capability button.


130
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,393 line:-1
It opens the list of capabilities.


131
00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:49.363 line:-2 align:center
The one I'm interested in
is called User Management.


132
00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:52.165 line:-1 align:center
So I'll type "user" to filter the list.


133
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.437 line:-2 align:center
Now I just double-click the capability
I want to add to my app.


134
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,509 line:-2
Down here
the "Runs as Current User" checkbox


135
00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:05.512 line:-1 align:center
is selected by default.


136
00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:07.981 line:-1 align:center
That is exactly what I need.


137
00:09:08.015 --> 00:09:11.251 line:-2 align:center
With this entitlement, my app's process
will always be launched


138
00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:13.620 line:-1 align:center
as the currently selected user.


139
00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:17.991 line:-2 align:center
The system will make sure
that the data for each user is distinct.


140
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,961 line:-1
All of it, including the Keychain.


141
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:24,298 line:-2
But for my app,
having a distinct Keychain per user,


142
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,900 line:-1
would have an unexpected side-effect.


143
00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:30.804 line:-2 align:center
It would require
each user to sign in separately.


144
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:36,610 line:-2
In tvOS 16 we can maintain the experience
of having a single account for all users


145
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,446 line:-1
while running as the current user.


146
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:44,885 line:-2
By using the new Keychain API
to access the user-independent Keychain.


147
00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.855 line:-2 align:center
I'll go now to
my KeychainController class,


148
00:09:47.888 --> 00:09:51.158 line:-2 align:center
I use it to read
and write to the Keychain.


149
00:09:52.993 --> 00:09:57.231 line:-2 align:center
Here I have the property baseQuery
which has the keys I need


150
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,701 line:-2
to access the credentials
for my app in the Keychain.


151
00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:04.004 line:-2 align:center
To update it to use the new
user-independent Keychain,


152
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,808 line:-2
all I have to do
is add a new element to the dictionary.


153
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:11,411 line:-2
I'll add the new
kSecUseUserIndependentKeychain,


154
00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:13.247 line:-1 align:center
and set it to true.


155
00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:19.553 line:-2 align:center
And that is all I need to change
to make the app share its credentials


156
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,621 line:-1
with all users.


157
00:10:20.654 --> 00:10:22.256 line:-1 align:center
Nothing else.


158
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:24.224 line:-1 align:center
It is important to note, though,


159
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:27,361 line:-1
all other data is still distinct per user.


160
00:10:27.394 --> 00:10:29.930 line:-2 align:center
Like UserDefaults,
which I'm going to use


161
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,966 line:-2
to remember the profile selection
for each user.


162
00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:37.237 line:-1 align:center
Now let's open my ProfileData class.


163
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:41,642 line:-2
This file is shared
between my iOS and tvOS projects.


164
00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:46.180 line:-2 align:center
In fact, the iOS version of my app
already stores the profile selection


165
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,282 line:-1
in UserDefaults,


166
00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:50.484 line:-1 align:center
but only when running on iOS.


167
00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:54.555 line:-2 align:center
And that is because
iPhones are personal devices.


168
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,524 line:-2
But now that my app runs
as the current user,


169
00:10:57.558 --> 00:11:00.260 line:-1 align:center
Apple TV can be as personal.


170
00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:05.799 line:-2 align:center
I can remove the iOS-check and have
the code work the same way on Apple TV.


171
00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:12.005 line:-2 align:center
The system will make sure to use
the correct UserDefaults for each user.


172
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,542 line:-2
When I run the new version of the app,
it is launched as the current user,


173
00:11:15.576 --> 00:11:16.710 line:-1 align:center
which is Mei.


174
00:11:16.743 --> 00:11:20.113 line:-1 align:center
Mei signs in and pick her profile.


175
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:24,251 line:-2
With the app running as the current user,
it behaves like Apple TV is,


176
00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:26.486 line:-1 align:center
at that moment, a personal device.


177
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,121 line:-1
Mei's device.


178
00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:32.526 line:-2 align:center
Mei's profile selection
gets stored in her UserDefaults.


179
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,561 line:-1
When it's time for Anne to watch,


180
00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:38.232 line:-2 align:center
they switch to their user
using Control Center.


181
00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:41.568 line:-2 align:center
The system will put up
a switching user UI,


182
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:43,904 line:-1
while it gives time to your process


183
00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:48.442 line:-2 align:center
to finish any last tasks
before it is relaunched.


184
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,979 line:-1
tvOS now relaunches the app as Anne.


185
00:11:52.012 --> 00:11:54.615 line:-1 align:center
Now Apple TV is Anne's device.


186
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:58,318 line:-2
The sign-in prompt is skipped,
because the credentials are stored


187
00:11:58.352 --> 00:12:02.523 line:-2 align:center
in the user-independent Keychain,
accessible by all users.


188
00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:06.994 line:-2 align:center
But Anne doesn't have a profile selection
stored in their UserDefaults yet,


189
00:12:07.027 --> 00:12:09.062 line:-1 align:center
and the profile picker is shown.


190
00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:14.968 line:-2 align:center
Picking Anne's profile,
saves the selection in their UserDefaults.


191
00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:19.706 line:-2 align:center
Okay now, at this point Mei and Anne
both have selected their profile.


192
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.141 line:-1 align:center
When switching users,


193
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:24,511 line:-2
the app won't show
any interstitial prompts anymore.


194
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:27,881 line:-1
It will always go straight to the content,


195
00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:31.451 line:-2 align:center
automatically selecting
the correct profile for each person.


196
00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:32.819 line:-1 align:center
Every time.


197
00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:36.790 line:-2 align:center
That is how, in tvOS 16,
we've made it much easier


198
00:12:36.823 --> 00:12:39.393 line:-1 align:center
to remember each user's profiles.


199
00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:43.664 line:-2 align:center
A simple new API to access
the user-independent Keychain,


200
00:12:43.697 --> 00:12:47.968 line:-2 align:center
with the system handling
separating each user's data.


201
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,605 line:-2
Now that you've seen how to remember
each user's profile selection


202
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:55,075 line:-2
without requiring everyone
to sign in separately,


203
00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:58.345 line:-1 align:center
let's review how apps work on Apple TV.


204
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,782 line:-2
Apps without the runs
as current user entitlement


205
00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:04.952 line:-1 align:center
use the resources of the Default User.


206
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:09,623 line:-2
You can think of it as being
the Apple TV's own resources.


207
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:14,061 line:-2
Switching users have no influence
on the app's process.


208
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:18,332 line:-2
Here are my recommendations
for when you do want to personalize.


209
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,201 line:-2
This table shows
the available capabilities


210
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:25,839 line:-2
depending on which features
you use on your tvOS apps.


211
00:13:25.873 --> 00:13:29.142 line:-2 align:center
If your app is a media app,
or like one,


212
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,212 line:-2
shows personalized content
through profiles;


213
00:13:32.246 --> 00:13:36.717 line:-2 align:center
while having a single account shared
between everyone using the Apple TV,


214
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.553 line:-2 align:center
you adopt
the Runs as Current User entitlement


215
00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:44.224 line:-2 align:center
and use the new user-independent
Keychain API.


216
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:48,395 line:-2
If, like a game,
your app is all about individual progress,


217
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,266 line:-2
all you have to do is adopt
the Runs as Current User entitlement,


218
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,169 line:-1
tvOS will handle the rest.


219
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,937 line:-1
And for all other apps,


220
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.973 line:-2 align:center
apps that present the same content
to all users–


221
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,242 line:-1
like for example, a recipe app–


222
00:14:02.276 --> 00:14:04.111 line:-1 align:center
you don't have to do anything.


223
00:14:04.144 --> 00:14:08.515 line:-2 align:center
Just create a new tvOS app project
in Xcode.


224
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:11,218 align:center
To learn more about
running as the current user,


225
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,922 line:0
watch our session from WWDC 2020.


226
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:21,161 line:0
We believe a streamlined direct-to-content
experience is the best one for a tvOS app.


227
00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.830 line:-2 align:center
I hope all these features help you
implement


228
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,600 line:-1
great big-screen experiences in your apps.


229
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,269 line:-2
Thanks for watching,
and enjoy the conference.
