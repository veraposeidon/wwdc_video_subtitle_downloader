00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.678 line:-2 align:center
Hi, I'm Ben,
from Privacy Engineering,


3
00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.815 line:-2 align:center
and welcome
to Create your Privacy Nutrition Label.


4
00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.818 line:-1 align:center
At WWDC 2020,


5
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.853 line:-2 align:center
we announced privacy nutrition labels
to provide people


6
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:23,891 line:-2
with an easily glanceable
and understandable summary


7
00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:27.828 line:-2 align:center
about how the apps they use
collect and use data.


8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:32,032 line:-2
In this talk, we'll discuss strategies
for creating an accurate label


9
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,667 line:-1
and highlight some definitions


10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,904 line:-2
and examples to keep in mind
as you build your label.


11
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,974 line:-2
Nutrition labels are one of many ways
you can communicate


12
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:42.776 line:-1 align:center
your app's privacy practices,


13
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.680 line:-2 align:center
in addition to a privacy policy
and App Privacy Report.


14
00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:51.552 line:-2 align:center
Labels can help you explain to people
how you use the data your app collects.


15
00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.188 line:-2 align:center
Additionally, sharing a label is
a requirement


16
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.523 line:-1 align:center
for all apps in the App Store.


17
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,793 line:-2
On an app's nutrition label,
you can see data the app collects


18
00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:03.297 line:-2 align:center
that is used for tracking,
data that is linked to identity,


19
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.033 line:-1 align:center
or associated with an account or profile,


20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,135 line:-1
and data that is not linked to identity.


21
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:12,439 line:-2
In each section, the categories
of data collected are shown.


22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,578 line:-2
Alternatively, if data is not collected,
an alternate label is shown.


23
00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:20.747 line:-2 align:center
From an app's product page
in the App Store,


24
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:24.184 line:-2 align:center
you can also view a more detailed version
of the nutrition label


25
00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:27.354 line:-2 align:center
that includes the specific types of data
the app collects


26
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,189 line:-1
and how that data is used.


27
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.328 line:-2 align:center
Today we'll be looking
at nutrition labels in more detail.


28
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:37.231 line:-2 align:center
We'll walk through the process
for how to create your label


29
00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:38.498 line:-1 align:center
in App Store Connect,


30
00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:41.168 line:-2 align:center
and I'll share some resources
along the way.


31
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.039 line:-2 align:center
Additionally, we'll provide
some more detailed definitions


32
00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:50.377 line:-2 align:center
and examples to help you
answer privacy questions for your app.


33
00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:54.715 line:-1 align:center
Let's begin with label creation process.


34
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:58,585 line:-2
To create your label, you'll be asked
about what data your app collects,


35
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,090 line:-2
use cases for each type of data,
and how that data is stored.


36
00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.026 line:-2 align:center
You might want to start
with creating an inventory


37
00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:08.729 line:-2 align:center
of your app's features
and data collection.


38
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,266 line:-2
An inventory can be a helpful resource
for the next step,


39
00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.469 line:-2 align:center
where you'll enter information
about your app's privacy practices


40
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,604 line:-1
into App Store Connect.


41
00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:21.742 line:-2 align:center
After you submit your label,
and as you update your data practices,


42
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,344 line:-2
you should keep your label updated
as appropriate.


43
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,016 line:-2
Lets dive right in and look
at how you can go about crafting


44
00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.851 line:-1 align:center
an inventory for your app.


45
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.254 line:-2 align:center
When you submit
your label to App Store Connect,


46
00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:37.691 line:-2 align:center
you'll answer some questions
about how your app uses data.


47
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:41,361 line:-2
You'll be asked about the categories
of data collected by your app,


48
00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:43.530 line:-1 align:center
the use cases for the data,


49
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,699 line:-1
whether the data is linked to identity,


50
00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.135 line:-1 align:center
and whether the data is used for tracking.


51
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,905 line:-2
However, as a developer,
you might not be thinking


52
00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.941 line:-1 align:center
about data categories in your app.


53
00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:56.143 line:-1 align:center
You're probably thinking about features,


54
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.046 line:-2 align:center
and if you're not sure where to start
on building the nutrition label,


55
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,981 line:-1
list out your app's features.


56
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,085 line:-2
Then consider what data powers
each feature,


57
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:09,323 line:-2
including what data is retained
and how that data is used.


58
00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:12.426 line:-2 align:center
You can then keep this list
as a reference for when you're asked


59
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,462 line:-2
to enter specific details
into App Store Connect.


60
00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:18.532 line:-2 align:center
We recommend finding a framework
to document this information


61
00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.702 line:-2 align:center
that works for your app,
and you may have many strategies


62
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,438 line:-2
to build an inventory
or other documentation.


63
00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:28.575 line:-2 align:center
When creating this inventory,
there are a number of resources


64
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,811 line:-1
that you can use along the way.


65
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:34,281 line:-2
Make sure to reach out to the stakeholders
working on your app.


66
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,884 line:-2
For example,
you can check with your marketing team


67
00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.852 line:-1 align:center
to understand what data they use


68
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,623 line:-2
and work with legal counsel to ensure
you document all data uses


69
00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.758 line:-1 align:center
described in your app's privacy policy.


70
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:49,863 line:-2
We also recommend consulting
internal documentation in this process.


71
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,267 line:-2
Consider looking
at your app's network traffic


72
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,304 line:-2
using App Privacy Report
or a network proxy tool.


73
00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:01.308 line:-2 align:center
You can use this information to learn
what domains your app is contacting


74
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,877 line:-2
and follow up with the owners
of those endpoints


75
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.146 line:-1 align:center
to understand how data is being used.


76
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.883 line:-2 align:center
Keep in mind that while a network audit
may be helpful in discovering


77
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,986 line:-2
where your app sends data,
it is not comprehensive,


78
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.789 line:-2 align:center
and you should use it
in combination with other strategies.


79
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,127 line:-2
You should also audit any data
you retain on a server,


80
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.129 line:-1 align:center
such as by reviewing database schemas


81
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,464 line:-2
and checking what systems
have access to data.


82
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,203 line:-2
Additionally, make sure to check
with any partners


83
00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:31.271 line:-1 align:center
that may be processing your app's data,


84
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:34,541 line:-2
as you are responsible
for declaring the collection practices


85
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,777 line:-1
of all data collected from your app,


86
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.847 line:-2 align:center
including data collected
by third-party SDKs,


87
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.984 line:-2 align:center
analytics tools, advertising networks,
or other external vendors.


88
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,522 align:center
Many SDKs provide documentation
of their privacy practices,


89
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,859 align:center
and some provide specific guidance
for nutrition labels


90
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:55,395 align:center
which you can use to ensure
your label is comprehensive.


91
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,366 line:-2
When building this inventory,
you might also discover


92
00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:02.202 line:-2 align:center
that there is data that you're collecting
that you don't need.


93
00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:06.473 line:-2 align:center
Inventorying your privacy practices
can be a way to identify opportunities


94
00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:10.477 line:-2 align:center
to make changes to your app's practices
by minimizing data collection,


95
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:14.581 line:-2 align:center
processing data on device,
and storing data not linked to identity.


96
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,853 line:-4
For some new technologies you can use,
see What's New In Privacy.


97
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:23,991 line:-2
Once you've built up an inventory
or documented your data practices


98
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,592 line:-1
through your preferred process,


99
00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:28.795 line:-2 align:center
you'll work though responding
to the questions in App Store Connect.


100
00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:34.101 line:-2 align:center
In App Store Connect,
account holders, admins, and app mangers


101
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,503 line:-1
can enter your app's privacy label.


102
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,773 line:-2
From your app's page,
open the App Privacy section.


103
00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:44.578 line:-2 align:center
First, you'll be asked
about whether your app collects data.


104
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:48.682 line:-2 align:center
Data is considered collected when it
is transmitted off device in a way


105
00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:52.386 line:-2 align:center
that is accessible for longer than
to service the request in real time.


106
00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.456 line:-2 align:center
So if you or any of your partners
retain data about interaction with the app


107
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.560 line:-2 align:center
on a server,
such as server logs, a user profile,


108
00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:02.629 line:-2 align:center
or analytics,
your app likely collects data.


109
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:08.101 line:-2 align:center
We designed labels
to describe all data apps collect.


110
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,704 line:-2
You should declare all data
collected by your app,


111
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,374 line:-2
even if people agree elsewhere
to the data collection or use.


112
00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:17.711 line:-2 align:center
Labels are a supplement
to a privacy policy


113
00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:18.779 line:-1 align:center
and any requirements


114
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,849 line:-2
for user transparency
or consent for data collection.


115
00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:26.653 line:-2 align:center
We recommend working with legal counsel
to evaluate those requirements.


116
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,823 line:-2
If you do collect data,
you'll be asked to declare


117
00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:32.125 line:-2 align:center
the categories of data
collected from your app,


118
00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:35.162 line:-2 align:center
such as email address,
phone number, or payment info.


119
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,832 line:-2
You'll then be able to preview
your label in progress


120
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,668 line:-2
and provide more detail
for each data category.


121
00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:44.505 line:-1 align:center
Let's work on phone number.


122
00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:48.342 line:-2 align:center
For each category of data,
you'll be asked to declare what use cases


123
00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:49.810 line:-1 align:center
the data collection supports,


124
00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:52.679 line:-2 align:center
such as analytics
or product personalization.


125
00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:55.649 line:-1 align:center
You'll then be asked to disclose


126
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,851 line:-2
whether data is linked
to a user's identity.


127
00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:03.824 line:-2 align:center
Data is considered linked to identity
if it is associated with an account,


128
00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:06.059 line:-1 align:center
device, or user profile.


129
00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:09.263 line:-2 align:center
This can be an opportunity
for you to evaluate whether you need


130
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:13,000 line:-2
to store data linked to identity,
and whether you can store data


131
00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:16.303 line:-2 align:center
in a way that isn't linkable
to any account or profile.


132
00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:20.741 line:-2 align:center
Finally, you'll be asked
whether each data type is used


133
00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.309 line:-1 align:center
for tracking purposes.


134
00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:26.680 line:-2 align:center
"Tracking" refers to linking data
collected from your app


135
00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:31.185 line:-2 align:center
about a particular end user or device,
such as a user identifier,


136
00:07:31.218 --> 00:07:35.222 line:-2 align:center
device identifier, or profile,
with third-party data


137
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,825 line:-2
for targeted advertising
or advertising measurement purposes,


138
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,161 line:-1
or sharing data collected from your app


139
00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:44.998 line:-2 align:center
about a particular end user
or device with a data broker.


140
00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.403 line:-2 align:center
As mentioned earlier,
nutrition labels are intended to reflect


141
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,672 line:-1
all data your app may collect,


142
00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:54.074 line:-2 align:center
even for features where people
using your app


143
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,344 line:-2
agree separately
to data collection or use.


144
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:02,416 line:-2
Ensure you disclose any data categories
used for tracking on your nutrition label.


145
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,485 line:-2
Additionally,
as all tracking must be with permission,


146
00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:09.389 line:-2 align:center
adopt App Tracking Transparency
if appropriate for your app.


147
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:15,128 align:center
For more information about tracking,
see Explore App Tracking Transparency.


148
00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:21.235 line:-2 align:center
Once you've submitted this information
for all data your app collects,


149
00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:24.238 line:-2 align:center
you'll be able
to preview and publish your label.


150
00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:29.142 line:-2 align:center
Your label will be published immediately,
independent from any updates to your app.


151
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,179 line:-1
Now that you've created your label,


152
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,982 line:-2
let's consider
when you'll need to update it.


153
00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.417 line:-1 align:center
You can update your label at any time,


154
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,621 line:-2
and aren't required to release
a new version of your app.


155
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,823 line:-2
We recommend re-evaluating
your app's label


156
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,826 line:-2
when releasing new features
and on an ongoing basis.


157
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,495 line:-1
As you change how your app uses data,


158
00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:51.064 line:-1 align:center
ensure your label remains up to date.


159
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,066 line:-1
If you're adding new features to your app,


160
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,871 line:-2
implementing new or updated integrations
with third-party partners or SDKs,


161
00:08:57.905 --> 00:09:00.541 line:-2 align:center
or using already-collected data
in new ways,


162
00:09:00.574 --> 00:09:04.077 line:-2 align:center
make sure to evaluate
whether any label changes are needed.


163
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:08.916 line:-2 align:center
Now that we've worked through the process
of building your privacy nutrition label,


164
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:14.087 line:-2 align:center
we'll discuss some additional guidance
around policy definitions and examples.


165
00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:18.392 line:-2 align:center
All of this information is available
in the Apple Developer documentation.


166
00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:23.430 line:-2 align:center
Today I'll be highlighting a few examples
based on our experience at Apple


167
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,333 line:-2
building nutrition labels
for our own apps,


168
00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:29.403 line:-2 align:center
and from some questions
we have heard from developers.


169
00:09:30.037 --> 00:09:33.907 line:-2 align:center
You might wonder
how to disclose use of IP address.


170
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,677 line:-2
IP addresses can be used
for multiple purposes,


171
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,181 line:-2
including as an identifier
or to infer approximate location.


172
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:44,051 line:-2
Our guidance is to declare
the collection categories


173
00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:47.554 line:-1 align:center
based on what the IP address is used for.


174
00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:51.024 line:-2 align:center
For example, if you use IP address
to show local content


175
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:54,728 line:-2
or for location analytics,
declare location.


176
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,266 line:-2
Another area to note is the categories
including product interaction.


177
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.004 line:-2 align:center
Product Interaction covers data
collected about the user's interactions


178
00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:07.941 line:-2 align:center
inside the app, such as information
about which screens people open.


179
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,979 line:-2
Browsing history refers
to collection of activity


180
00:10:12.012 --> 00:10:15.849 line:-2 align:center
that is not part of the app,
such as an in-app browser.


181
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:19,119 align:center
Search History is searches
performed within the app


182
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:23,190 line:0
for any content,
both in the app or in in-app browsers.


183
00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:27.127 line:-2 align:center
Labels are intended
to comprehensively describe


184
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,862 line:-1
the app's primary functionality


185
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,765 line:-2
and features encountered
by all of your app's users.


186
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,035 line:-2
However, there are certain types
of collection


187
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,271 line:-1
that are optional to disclose.


188
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,541 line:-2
Collection that is infrequent, optional,
and independent


189
00:10:40.574 --> 00:10:43.043 line:-1 align:center
from the app's primary functionality,


190
00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:46.413 line:-2 align:center
clearly discloses all collection
at submission time,


191
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:52,085 line:-2
and has limited use purposes, for example,
not used for tracking or advertising,


192
00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.021 line:-1 align:center
may be optional to disclose.


193
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,158 line:-2
Feedback forms and report-a-problem flows
are some features


194
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,927 line:-1
that may meet these requirements.


195
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:04,264 line:-2
Full details and requirements
for the optional disclosure policy


196
00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:08.202 line:-2 align:center
are available on the "App privacy details
on the App Store" page


197
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,637 line:-1
in Apple Developer documentation.


198
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,439 line:-1
And that's a wrap!


199
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:16,410 line:-2
Here are four things to keep
in mind while building your label.


200
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:20,180 line:-2
Make sure to reach out to all stakeholders
working on your app


201
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:24,051 line:-2
to inventory your collection
and ensure your label is accurate.


202
00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:28.255 line:-2 align:center
Remember to include
all collection from your app,


203
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,791 line:-1
including from SDKs and other partners.


204
00:11:31.892 --> 00:11:36.763 line:-2 align:center
If applicable to your app, ensure
you request permission for tracking,


205
00:11:36.797 --> 00:11:39.967 line:-2 align:center
in addition to disclosing
any use on your nutrition label.


206
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:45,305 line:-2
Finally, when you update your app
or change how you use data,


207
00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:47.040 line:-1 align:center
ensure your label is updated.


208
00:11:48.175 --> 00:11:50.077 line:-1 align:center
Thanks for joining me today.


209
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,746 line:-2
Privacy Nutrition Labels
are a way to build trust


210
00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:54.548 line:-1 align:center
with people who use your app


211
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:57.518 line:-2 align:center
and help people
understand how you use data.


212
00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:00.921 line:-2 align:center
The Apple Developer Documentation
and App Store Connect


213
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,824 line:-2
have even more information
to reference throughout the process


214
00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:06.059 line:-1 align:center
of building and updating your label.
