00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,012 line:-2
Hi.
I'm Stephanie Angulo.


4
00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.814 line:-1 align:center
and I'm Marcus Jackson.


5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,550 line:-2
We're software engineers
on the Swift Playgrounds Content team.


6
00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.885 line:-2 align:center
Today, we will give you
the tools to create


7
00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:20.187 line:-1 align:center
engaging content for Swift Playgrounds.


8
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:24,291 line:-2
Swift Playgrounds 4 introduced
app development on iPad and Mac.


9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,594 line:-2
It's the best way to learn
about building apps for the App Store.


10
00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:30.631 line:-2 align:center
Our team has released a number
of tutorial and sample code products


11
00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.267 line:-2 align:center
that help you learn the fundamentals
of app development.


12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,935 line:-1
We cover topics like


13
00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:38.705 line:-2 align:center
building dynamic SwiftUI apps
using observable data models,


14
00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.442 line:-2 align:center
customizing views with fun
SwiftUI animations and shapes,


15
00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:45.679 line:-2 align:center
and more advanced topics,
like asynchronous data fetching.


16
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,115 line:-2
In today's session,
we'll provide an overview


17
00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.083 line:-1 align:center
of our new instructional system,


18
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,819 line:-2
write content
using the project's guide module,


19
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:57,791 line:-2
and build an immersive learning experience
with walkthrough and experiment tasks.


20
00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.159 line:-1 align:center
Let's get started.


21
00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:02.729 line:-2 align:center
Imagine a learner completing our tutorial,
"Keep Going with Apps."


22
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,831 line:-2
They'll end up with an app called,
"Emoji App."


23
00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:09.703 line:-2 align:center
In this app, they can keep track
of all their favorite animals in a list,


24
00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:13.574 line:-1 align:center
change their color and size,


25
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,742 line:-2
and tap on the animals
to watch them get their groove on


26
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,411 line:-1
in "Creature Dance" view.


27
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,348 line:-2
This dance view is fun,
but I want the vibe to be


28
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,850 line:-1
more of an actual dance party.


29
00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:25.719 line:-2 align:center
So let's go ahead and add some extra
features we can show our learners.


30
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:30.290 line:-2 align:center
Here, I added a bit more code
to "Creature Dance" view.


31
00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:32.593 line:-1 align:center
Every party needs a dance floor.


32
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:35,863 line:-2
So I made a 10x10 grid
that I set as my view's background.


33
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,566 line:-2
And each tile in the grid
updates its color randomly


34
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.735 line:-1 align:center
using a custom view modifier.


35
00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:44.304 line:-1 align:center
Looks groovy huh?


36
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.976 line:-2 align:center
I also wanted to make sure
our favorite animals can dance


37
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,478 line:-2
without our help,
so I made a few more custom modifiers


38
00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:57.251 line:-2 align:center
that help animate the animals' scale,
position offset, and rotation.


39
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:02,489 line:-2
In all of these custom modifiers,
these animations are set to repeatForever,


40
00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:06.193 line:-2 align:center
which means our animals can dance
all night on their brand-new dance floor.


41
00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.630 line:-2 align:center
And finally,
to really light up the dance floor,


42
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,432 line:-2
I added an animated disco ball
at the top of our view.


43
00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:16.036 line:-2 align:center
Adding this final touch
really pulls it all together


44
00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.038 line:-1 align:center
for the ultimate dance party.


45
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.873 line:-2 align:center
I've made quite a few changes
to this project,


46
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,776 line:-2
and I didn't even to dive into the details
of custom view modifiers.


47
00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.379 line:-2 align:center
So how should we explain this
to our learners?


48
00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:27.748 line:-2 align:center
You could direct a learner
to Apple's documentation,


49
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,284 line:-2
but now you also have
the option to teach these concepts


50
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,220 line:-2
alongside your project's code
in Swift Playgrounds.


51
00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:35.189 line:-2 align:center
Our team has built
this new instructional system


52
00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:37.157 line:-1 align:center
that's designed to help authors like you


53
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.794 line:-2 align:center
create engaging in-app experiences
for your learners.


54
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,330 line:-2
Today, we'll walk you through
how to build the learning content


55
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,332 line:-1
for this app in Swift Playgrounds 4.


56
00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.368 line:-2 align:center
Let me give you a sneak peek
of what you'll be walking away with.


57
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,904 line:-2
When a learner first opens
your content on Swift Playgrounds,


58
00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:53.974 line:-2 align:center
you can introduce them to the project
with an optional welcome message,


59
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.010 line:-1 align:center
as shown here from our friend Byte.


60
00:02:57.044 --> 00:02:59.680 line:-2 align:center
The welcome message sits at the top
of the project's source editor


61
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,082 line:-1
on the left hand side of the screen,


62
00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.818 line:-2 align:center
while on the right hand side
of the screen is the learning center.


63
00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:09.389 line:-2 align:center
The learning center is a designated area
where you can add images


64
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,492 line:-2
and instructional text that describes
your content to your learners.


65
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,929 line:-2
In our welcome message
and our learning center,


66
00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:18.799 line:-2 align:center
we're letting our learners know that this
project will be pumping up the jams


67
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,269 line:-2
with the help of SwiftUI colors,
shapes, and animations.


68
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:26.907 line:-2 align:center
The learning center also contains
a section for tasks.


69
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.144 line:-2 align:center
Tasks are coding objectives you the author
can write to help guide your learners.


70
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,547 line:-2
They're a fundamental
building block for content.


71
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,850 line:-2
By tapping a task button
in the learning center,


72
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,052 line:-2
our instructional system will open up
a Swift file


73
00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:42.723 line:-2 align:center
and render a card with learning material
at the top of that file.


74
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:48,829 line:-2
This card can contain a series of pages
with text, images, and code snippets.


75
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,832 line:-2
Later, Marcus will go over
two tasks types:


76
00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:54.368 line:-1 align:center
walkthroughs and experiments.


77
00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:58.739 line:-2 align:center
At a high level, that's what
our instructional system has to offer.


78
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,941 line:-1
With the right prose and the right tasks,


79
00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:05.012 line:-2 align:center
you can build a compelling
educational experience for your learners.


80
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,214 line:-2
Now, in order to start
creating your own content,


81
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,483 line:-2
we first need to talk
about the guide module.


82
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:12,586 line:-2
By default,
the file structure of a swiftpm project


83
00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.488 line:-1 align:center
keeps all its source code at its root.


84
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,989 line:-1
In order to upgrade your project


85
00:04:16.023 --> 00:04:17.891 line:-2 align:center
to take advantage
of the instructional system,


86
00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:20.194 line:-1 align:center
you'll need to change its file structure.


87
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,563 line:-1
We first need to create an App module.


88
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:25.265 line:-2 align:center
Once it's created, we need to move
all our project's source code


89
00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:26.934 line:-1 align:center
and assets into it.


90
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,937 line:-2
The Package.swift file should be
left at the root of our project.


91
00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:34.341 line:-1 align:center
Then we need to create a guide module.


92
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:39,079 line:-2
This module should be at the same level
as the App module and Package.swift file.


93
00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.982 line:-2 align:center
Inside the guide module,
you'll need a guide file.


94
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,285 line:-2
This file will include all the prose
of your learning content.


95
00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.887 line:-1 align:center
I've already started on my guide file,


96
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.256 line:-2 align:center
so let's check out the content
I've written so far.


97
00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:54.795 line:-2 align:center
The guide file contains a combination
of directives and markdown.


98
00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:57.698 line:-2 align:center
Directives are an extension of markdown
that can take in primitive types


99
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,401 line:-2
as attributes, such as strings,
as well as more complex types,


100
00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:03.604 line:-2 align:center
like markdown elements
and other directives.


101
00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:07.007 line:-2 align:center
Directives can act as containers
for other directives,


102
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,111 line:-2
but they can also represent UI elements
in our instructional system.


103
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,248 line:-2
First in the guide file, I've added
the necessary guidebook directive


104
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,550 line:-2
that's wrapped
around the entirety of the file.


105
00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:19.753 line:-2 align:center
It acts as the main container
for all our directives.


106
00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:23.223 line:-2 align:center
Its parameters include a title,
icon and background image,


107
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:26,727 line:-2
and the file you first want opened
when you open the project.


108
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,163 line:-2
Under the guidebook directive,
I've added a welcome message directive.


109
00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:32.666 line:-2 align:center
Welcome messages are optional
and as mentioned earlier,


110
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,603 line:-2
they are presented to the learner
when they first open up the project.


111
00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:39.873 line:-2 align:center
Below the welcome message directive,
I've added a guide directive


112
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,909 line:-1
that's wrapped around a step directive.


113
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,378 line:-2
The guide directive acts as a container
for your steps


114
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,812 line:-1
and steps map out to your content


115
00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:48.615 line:-2 align:center
displayed in the learning center
and tasks.


116
00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:51.685 line:-2 align:center
To start adding images and instructional
text in your learning center,


117
00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:54.888 line:-2 align:center
you'll need to include a ContentAndMedia
directive inside your step.


118
00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:58.725 line:-2 align:center
So I got this party started
by adding a dance floor,


119
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,795 line:-2
a nice welcome message,
and the prose for the learning center.


120
00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.797 line:-2 align:center
Marcus,
do you wanna keep this party going?


121
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.532 line:-1 align:center
Marcus: Definitely.


122
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,202 line:-2
What a dope dance floor
for our creatures to party on.


123
00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:11.405 line:-2 align:center
While this effect is really cool,
I think it might be too much


124
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,307 line:-1
for someone who is still learning.


125
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,077 line:-2
To help explain this code,
we can use walkthrough tasks.


126
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,479 line:-1
Let's start with a one-page walkthrough.


127
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:22,583 line:-2
Later, I'll show you
how to fill out the rest.


128
00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:25.519 line:-2 align:center
Stephanie already showed you
the beginnings of our guidebook,


129
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,721 line:-1
as well as a helpful welcome message.


130
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,591 line:-2
We already have the first directive
you need to create tasks,


131
00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:32.226 line:-1 align:center
the step directive.


132
00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.562 line:-2 align:center
The step directive is where
our walkthrough content will live.


133
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,166 line:-2
To make a step, you need to fill it
with two other directives.


134
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,703 line:-2
Here, we've already added
a content and media directive.


135
00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.973 line:-2 align:center
This directive contains markdown
that goes into the learning center


136
00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:47.574 line:-1 align:center
on the right hand side.


137
00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:51.578 line:-2 align:center
The body of this directive can contain
any form of markdown text.


138
00:06:51.612 --> 00:06:54.481 line:-2 align:center
This is the place to put longer prose
and larger images


139
00:06:54.515 --> 00:06:56.617 line:-1 align:center
that might help cover your topic.


140
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,654 line:-2
Here is the content and media directive
being displayed in Playgrounds.


141
00:07:00.687 --> 00:07:02.856 line:-2 align:center
While the area seems small
in this example,


142
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.060 line:-2 align:center
this view can extend further down
and is contained in a scroll view.


143
00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:09.963 line:-2 align:center
This makes it a great place
to write longer bits of prose


144
00:07:09.997 --> 00:07:13.400 line:-1 align:center
and show complex content such as diagrams.


145
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.836 line:-2 align:center
Once you have
your content and media written,


146
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:19.273 line:-2 align:center
we can add in the second
required directive, tasks.


147
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:23,277 line:-2
We add our tasks into another directive
called a task group.


148
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.047 line:-2 align:center
Task groups are an optional directive
you can put inside of steps,


149
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.850 line:-2 align:center
if you want to collect
a group of tasks together.


150
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,086 line:-2
You might consider this if you have
content which covers the same topic


151
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,957 line:-2
across multiple files
or different types of tasks.


152
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,194 line:-2
Within the task group,
we can add a short bit of text.


153
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,263 line:-2
This will be displayed
in the learning center as a subtitle.


154
00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:47.234 line:-2 align:center
Here is how a task group
displays in Playgrounds.


155
00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:51.338 line:-2 align:center
Now that I have
my task group and my subtitle,


156
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,575 line:-1
I can start adding task directives.


157
00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:56.810 line:-1 align:center
Tasks have a few parameters


158
00:07:56.844 --> 00:07:58.579 line:-1 align:center
The first parameter is type.


159
00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:00.214 line:-1 align:center
This lets the instructional system know


160
00:08:00.247 --> 00:08:03.684 line:-2 align:center
what UI to generate
when displaying this task.


161
00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:06.453 line:-1 align:center
Next, every task needs an ID.


162
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,956 line:-2
IDs are strings
that can be anything you want.


163
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,593 line:-2
However, every ID in the guide
must be unique.


164
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,329 line:-1
The title parameter is also a string.


165
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,866 line:-2
This can also be whatever you want
and does not have to be unique.


166
00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.935 line:-2 align:center
This title will be rendered
by the task card UI.


167
00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:24.671 line:-2 align:center
Finally, the file parameter tells
the learning center


168
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:29,142 line:-2
which file in the project to open
when the learner starts this task.


169
00:08:29.176 --> 00:08:32.145 line:-2 align:center
Here is how
a task displays on Playgrounds.


170
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.314 line:-1 align:center
The title sits inside of a button,


171
00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.950 line:-2 align:center
and the file of the walkthrough
is listed above it.


172
00:08:36.984 --> 00:08:39.520 line:-1 align:center
Now we have our walkthrough task written.


173
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,655 line:-1
Let's add our first page.


174
00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.124 line:-2 align:center
Page directives go
inside the body of a task


175
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,994 line:-2
and have the following
mandatory parameters:


176
00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:50.330 line:-2 align:center
The ID parameter behaves
just like the ID for a task,


177
00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:53.667 line:-2 align:center
so they must be unique
for the entire guide file.


178
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,637 line:-2
The title parameter behaves
a lot like the one for tasks.


179
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.107 line:-2 align:center
However, when you leave
the title string empty on a page,


180
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,075 line:-1
this lets the instructional system know


181
00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:05.479 line:-2 align:center
to use the task's title
when displaying this page.


182
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,649 line:-2
Inside of a page,
you can add any markdown text,


183
00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:11.118 line:-2 align:center
similar to the content
and media directive.


184
00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:14.855 line:-2 align:center
However, the task view is
much smaller than the learning center.


185
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,492 line:-2
Keep your text short and avoid
using complex images like diagrams


186
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,328 line:-2
because they may be hard
for the learner to read.


187
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:25,065 line:-2
This is the first page of our walkthrough
as rendered by Swift Playgrounds.


188
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,434 line:-2
We're almost done
with our first walkthrough,


189
00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:29.970 line:-2 align:center
but first I need to show you
how to highlight the code


190
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:33,040 line:-1
as shown in the last screenshot.


191
00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:36.743 line:-2 align:center
For that, we need to add some markers
to CreatureDance.swift.


192
00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:38.545 line:-1 align:center
When my walkthrough is shown,


193
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,848 line:-2
I'd like to highlight
the first custom modifier,


194
00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:43.317 line:-1 align:center
the animatedScalingEffect.


195
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,954 line:-2
To add highlights to a line,
I'll add a pair of comments on the lines


196
00:09:46.987 --> 00:09:49.389 line:-1 align:center
before and after the code.


197
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,427 line:-2
We start with the multiline
comment syntax, /*


198
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.231 line:-2 align:center
Inside the comment,
we write #-code


199
00:09:57.264 --> 00:10:01.635 line:-2 align:center
-walkthrough,
followed by a pair of parentheses.


200
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,704 line:-1
Inside the parentheses, we write the ID


201
00:10:03.737 --> 00:10:05.906 line:-2 align:center
of the page directive
we want to highlight.


202
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,575 line:-1
In this case, 1.modifier.


203
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.679 line:-1 align:center
Now, let's test this out in Playgrounds.


204
00:10:12.713 --> 00:10:15.215 line:-1 align:center
Let's open the Emoji App project.


205
00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:21.221 line:-2 align:center
When you open the project,
you're greeted with the source editor


206
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:23,957 line:-1
on the left and the preview on the right.


207
00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:26.560 line:-2 align:center
Above the source editor
is our welcome message,


208
00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:30.831 line:-2 align:center
where our buddy Byte gives you an overview
of what learning content there is to do.


209
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,066 line:-1
I'll tap on the Learn More button.


210
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.940 line:-2 align:center
The preview on the right
is swapped out for the learning center.


211
00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:43.744 line:-2 align:center
At the top is the prose we wrote
in the ContentAndMedia directive.


212
00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:45.946 line:-1 align:center
Below that is the task group,


213
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,183 line:-2
as well as the button
with the title of our walkthrough.


214
00:10:49.216 --> 00:10:51.818 line:-2 align:center
Walkthroughs are denoted
in the learning center as buttons


215
00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:55.589 line:-2 align:center
with pictures of another one
of Byte's friends, Expert.


216
00:10:58.058 --> 00:11:00.460 line:-1 align:center
Tapping on this button does a few things:


217
00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:04.298 line:-2 align:center
First, the learning center is once again
swapped out for the preview.


218
00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:07.734 line:-2 align:center
Second, if it isn't already open,
the file specified


219
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:11,104 line:-2
in the task's file parameter
is opened in the source editor.


220
00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:14.975 line:-2 align:center
Third, the task view drops down
above the source editor.


221
00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:17.878 line:-2 align:center
Finally, the source editor highlights
the code marked


222
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,880 line:-1
in the code walkthrough comments.


223
00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:23.584 line:-2 align:center
If the content is not on screen,
the source editor will scroll


224
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:27,020 line:-2
until the lines of code that need
to be highlighted appear.


225
00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:30.257 line:-2 align:center
And that is how you write
a walkthrough in Swift Playgrounds,


226
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,359 line:-2
but I think it's fair to say
you're probably curious


227
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,162 line:-2
what a walkthrough
with multiple pages looks like.


228
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:39.833 line:-2 align:center
To do that, I'll open the project in Xcode
to fill out the rest of my walkthrough.


229
00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:44.638 line:-2 align:center
Now with the guide file open in Xcode,
I'd like to add a couple more pages


230
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:46.139 line:-1 align:center
to my walkthrough.


231
00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:49.276 line:-2 align:center
I've explained a little bit
about what a view modifier is,


232
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,146 line:-2
but I'd like to explain more
about how to build a custom view modifier.


233
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,182 line:-1
I'll go ahead and add those pages.


234
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,888 line:-1
Great.


235
00:12:00.921 --> 00:12:04.091 line:-2 align:center
Now we have our walkthrough
for custom view modifiers.


236
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:08,762 line:-2
I think now is also a good time
to explain the ViewModifier protocol.


237
00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:13.433 line:-2 align:center
This way, learners can try to make
their own ViewModifiers if they want to.


238
00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:16.436 line:-2 align:center
To do this, I'll add another walkthrough
to our task group.


239
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.210 line:-2 align:center
We now have
a fully fleshed out pair of walkthroughs.


240
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,213 line:-2
I'll switch back over to my iPad
to see how it looks.


241
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.583 line:-1 align:center
When we open our project,


242
00:12:29.616 --> 00:12:32.019 line:-2 align:center
there are now two walkthroughs
in the learning center.


243
00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:34.788 line:-2 align:center
I'll start by tapping
on the first walkthrough.


244
00:12:37.324 --> 00:12:40.694 line:-2 align:center
Just like before,
the line with the view modifier highlights


245
00:12:40.727 --> 00:12:44.498 line:-2 align:center
and our task view drops down
to explain what this code is.


246
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,700 line:-1
Now I can tap the next button.


247
00:12:49.703 --> 00:12:52.506 line:-2 align:center
The source editor now scrolls down
to the modifier struct


248
00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:55.209 line:-1 align:center
and explains what this struct is for.


249
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:02,416 line:-2
Tapping on the next button again moves
to the final page of this walkthrough,


250
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,687 line:-2
which explains more about the body method
inside the modifier struct.


251
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.158 line:-2 align:center
In the bottom corner of the task view,
there is a button marked Next Walkthrough.


252
00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:17.898 line:-2 align:center
Tapping on this automatically begins
the next walkthrough task.


253
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:21,602 line:-2
This functionality is given to you
for free by the instructional system


254
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,438 line:-2
as long as there is another task
to progress to.


255
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,908 line:-2
Now that I am here, I will tap
through the rest of this walkthrough.


256
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,884 line:-2
And that is how you build walkthroughs
in Swift Playgrounds.


257
00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:40.354 line:-2 align:center
Next, I'd like to show you how to create
a different kind of task


258
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:44,424 line:-2
that will allow learners to try adding
code themselves and seeing what happens.


259
00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:47.561 line:-2 align:center
So at this point,
we have a good party going.


260
00:13:47.594 --> 00:13:51.098 line:-2 align:center
Our creatures are dancing, and they have
some lights in the background.


261
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,200 line:-2
While it basically looks
like a nightclub in there,


262
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,636 line:-1
I think we can do a little bit better.


263
00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:58.372 line:-2 align:center
I think it would be great
to add some colors to our creatures


264
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,909 line:-2
so it looks like they're dancing under
the strobe lights of their little club.


265
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,878 line:-1
But that's just me. What would you do?


266
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:08,115 line:-1
This is where experiment tasks come in.


267
00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:12.152 line:-2 align:center
Experiments are optional bits of code
learners can add


268
00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:14.021 line:-1 align:center
if they are feeling extra curious


269
00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:17.558 line:-2 align:center
or if they want a way
of making the app unique to them.


270
00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:20.961 line:-2 align:center
Back in the guide file,
we can add our experiment task


271
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,630 line:-2
to the same step
we were already working on.


272
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,600 line:-2
I've created a new task group
to hold our experiments


273
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,969 line:-1
which I've named "Experiments."


274
00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:31.839 line:-2 align:center
I've populated it with a subtitle
as well as the beginnings


275
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,674 line:-1
of our first experiment task.


276
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:38,545 line:-2
The first difference between
an experiment task and a walkthrough


277
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,914 line:-1
is what goes into the type parameter.


278
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:45,252 line:-2
The other parameters follow
a similar convention to walkthrough tasks.


279
00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:48.522 line:-2 align:center
Page directives work the same way
they do in walkthroughs.


280
00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:53.861 line:-2 align:center
However, for experiments, we add
one optional parameter, isAddable.


281
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:57,297 line:-2
The isAddable parameter allows
experiment tasks to add code


282
00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:59.633 line:-1 align:center
directly into the source editor.


283
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,536 line:-2
When isAddable is set to true,
an add button appears


284
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:05.506 line:-2 align:center
in the learning task card
next to the code snippet.


285
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:08,442 line:-2
The code in a page directive
must be wrapped in a code block


286
00:15:08.475 --> 00:15:11.111 line:-2 align:center
using the triple back tick
markdown syntax.


287
00:15:11.144 --> 00:15:15.148 line:-2 align:center
It's best practice to keep
your code blocks to ten lines or less.


288
00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:18.452 line:-2 align:center
While the task view can show
longer code snippets if need be,


289
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:21,221 line:-2
it's better
if learners don't have to scroll.


290
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,191 line:-2
Here is how the code view
displays in Playgrounds.


291
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,560 line:-2
To the right of the code snippet,
is an add button,


292
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,030 line:-2
since the isAddable parameter
was set to true.


293
00:15:30.063 --> 00:15:33.600 line:-2 align:center
That is almost everything we need
to write an experiment task.


294
00:15:33.634 --> 00:15:35.769 line:-1 align:center
But remember that isAddable parameter?


295
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,806 line:-2
This allows the experiment task
to add code to the source editor,


296
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.310 line:-2 align:center
but we need to tell Playgrounds
where in the code to add the snippet.


297
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:47,114 line:-1
Here we are again in CreatureDance.swift.


298
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:51,785 line:-2
I want learners to add the color modifier
right below the opacity modifier.


299
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:55,455 line:-2
So that's where I'll add
my experiment task comment.


300
00:15:55.489 --> 00:16:00.561 line:-2 align:center
Experiment task comments are single line,
meaning they start with a double slash.


301
00:16:00.594 --> 00:16:06.033 line:-2 align:center
Then, we write #-
learning-task.


302
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,468 line:-1
After, comes a pair of parentheses,


303
00:16:08.502 --> 00:16:12.239 line:-2 align:center
and inside we write the ID
of the experiment task.


304
00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:16.510 line:-2 align:center
Now we have everything we need
to test out our experiment task.


305
00:16:16.543 --> 00:16:20.547 line:-2 align:center
Once again, I have all this
already written in the swiftpm project


306
00:16:20.581 --> 00:16:22.382 line:-1 align:center
Stephanie and I are working on.


307
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,084 line:-1
Let's check it out.


308
00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:26.787 line:-2 align:center
We're back once again
to the learning center.


309
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.957 line:-2 align:center
This time I want to focus
on the bottom task group,


310
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,992 line:-1
where our first experiment is.


311
00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:34.761 line:-2 align:center
Experiments are noted
in the instructional system


312
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,397 line:-1
by another one of Byte's friends, Blu.


313
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:39.433 line:-1 align:center
Let's tap on the experiment task.


314
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,971 line:-1
What happens next should seem familiar.


315
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,739 line:-1
The task view drops down.


316
00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:49.276 line:-2 align:center
However, this time,
the task view contains a code view.


317
00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:52.012 line:-2 align:center
On the right of the code view
is an add button.


318
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:55,215 line:-2
Tapping on this adds the code
right to the source editor.


319
00:16:57.117 --> 00:16:59.253 line:-2 align:center
With the code now added,
I'd like to check out


320
00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:01.722 line:-2 align:center
what changes that made
to the CreatureDanceView.


321
00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:03.590 line:-1 align:center
Let's start this party!


322
00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:07.227 line:-1 align:center
Sweet.


323
00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:09.563 line:-2 align:center
Now we can see the lights
hitting our creatures.


324
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:13,000 line:-2
This is pretty groovy, but I think
we can take it up one more notch


325
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:17,271 line:-2
by using a timer to give the creatures
a random color every few seconds.


326
00:17:17.304 --> 00:17:20.174 line:-2 align:center
To do that, we'll need to add
another experiment,


327
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,610 line:-2
so let's take this project back to Xcode
and add our new task.


328
00:17:23.644 --> 00:17:25.746 line:-1 align:center
Before we add in our second experiment,


329
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:30,250 line:-2
I think it's a good idea to add a page
to the experiment that's already there.


330
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:33,320 line:-2
For a learner,
it can be confusing to add a block of code


331
00:17:33.353 --> 00:17:35.956 line:-1 align:center
and not know why or what it does.


332
00:17:35.989 --> 00:17:40.594 line:-2 align:center
To help with that, I'll add a page
with some text before our code page.


333
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:49,870 line:-1
Now, we are ready to add our second task.


334
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,807 line:-2
Again, I want the learner
to add some code to their project,


335
00:17:53.841 --> 00:17:58.512 line:-2 align:center
so I'll add a page explaining the code
followed by an addable code snippet.


336
00:17:59.813 --> 00:18:03.450 line:-2 align:center
And with that, we have made
a new piece of content to teach learners


337
00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:07.487 line:-2 align:center
about some of the things you can do
with custom view modifiers.


338
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:10,157 line:-2
Hey, Stephanie, you ready to show them
what we've built?


339
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,525 line:-1
Stephanie: Yeah, let's do it.


340
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,362 line:-2
I'll open the final version of our content
on my iPad


341
00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:18.198 line:-2 align:center
and check out how my changes
and Marcus' changes flow together.


342
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:20,100 line:-1
When I first open the project,


343
00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:23.937 line:-2 align:center
the welcome message animates in,
introducing us to Creature Party.


344
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:27,441 line:-2
When I tap on the Learn More button
in the welcome message,


345
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,643 line:-1
it opens the learning center for me.


346
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:30,511 line:-1
Awesome.


347
00:18:30.544 --> 00:18:32.546 line:-2 align:center
Our learning center does have
my description at the top


348
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,481 line:-1
and the four tasks Marcus added.


349
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:36,416 line:-1
Let's tap on the first walkthrough.


350
00:18:37.885 --> 00:18:40.320 line:-2 align:center
Here, Marcus used
my AnimatedScalingModifier


351
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:43,590 line:-2
as an example to explain
how to use custom view modifiers.


352
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:49,763 line:-2
When I tap on the Next Walkthrough Button,
the second walkthrough animates in.


353
00:18:51.198 --> 00:18:56.003 line:-2 align:center
Marcus used the View Modifier protocol as
an example to describe how protocols work.


354
00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:58.639 line:-2 align:center
After finishing the second walkthrough,
when I tap Done,


355
00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:00.908 line:-1 align:center
the first experiment task segues in.


356
00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:04.945 line:-2 align:center
The Dancing in the Strobe Light task
tells me


357
00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:07.648 line:-2 align:center
I can add some color to our creatures
by adding this code snippet


358
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:10,050 line:-1
containing a colorMultiply modifier.


359
00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:12.486 line:-2 align:center
Let's remind ourselves
what this dance party looks like


360
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,121 line:-1
before adding the code snippet.


361
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,791 line:-1
All right, cool.


362
00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:20.027 line:-1 align:center
I'll add the code snippet by tapping Add


363
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.529 line:-2 align:center
and tap Start the Party again
to check out the changes.


364
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,934 line:-1
Nice, the creatures changed color.


365
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:30,337 line:-2
I'll complete this experiment task now
and transition to the last one.


366
00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:34.942 line:-2 align:center
The Switch It Up experiment task
tells me I can customize the color


367
00:19:34.975 --> 00:19:37.377 line:-2 align:center
of the animals
with a tap gesture and a timer.


368
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:40,414 line:-2
I'll add the code snippet
and start the party once more.


369
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:45,118 line:-2
And now when I tap on the animals,
they change color.


370
00:19:45.152 --> 00:19:46.753 line:-1 align:center
Nice.


371
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:49,957 line:-2
I'll complete this last task
and head back to the learning center.


372
00:19:52.593 --> 00:19:54.962 line:-2 align:center
Now, all tasks are marked as completed
in the learning center,


373
00:19:54.995 --> 00:19:56.763 line:-1 align:center
which means we've completed this sample.


374
00:19:58.832 --> 00:20:00.801 line:-2 align:center
And that's how you take advantage
of our new content features


375
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,336 line:-1
in Swift Playgrounds 4.


376
00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.571 line:-2 align:center
We hope you enjoyed today's session
and we're so excited


377
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,540 line:-2
to see what sorts
of learning experiences you'll build.


378
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:09,009 line:-2
Don't forget to check out
the other Swift Playgrounds session,


379
00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.211 line:-1 align:center
Build your First App in Swift Playgrounds.


380
00:20:11.245 --> 00:20:12.713 line:-1 align:center
Enjoy the rest of WWDC.


381
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:16,083 line:-2
Marcus: And now, if you'll excuse us,
we have a party to attend.
