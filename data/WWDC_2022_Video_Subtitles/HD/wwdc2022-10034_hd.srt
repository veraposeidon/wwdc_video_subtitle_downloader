3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,578 line:-1
Hi, I am Mohamed Samir,


4
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,114 line:-1
a designer on the Apple Design team.


5
00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:17.117 line:-2 align:center
Today, I'm going to walk you through
some of the best practices


6
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.686 line:-1 align:center
when it comes to designing an Arabic app.


7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,857 line:-2
This session is also available in Arabic,
so feel free to check it out.


8
00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:27.027 line:-2 align:center
And before we get started,
I wanted to touch on why it's important


9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.264 line:-2 align:center
to consider designing
or optimizing your app or game


10
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:33,333 line:-1
to be used by Arab audience.


11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:37,971 line:-2
There is around 660 million people
that uses the Arabic script today,


12
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,807 line:-2
which makes it the third most written
language in the world


13
00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.976 line:-1 align:center
after Latin and Chinese.


14
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.179 line:-1 align:center
People from more than 22 countries,


15
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:49,550 line:-2
many cities, and regions would potentially
see and use what you've built.


16
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,419 line:-2
And If you want to reach even a fraction
of that audience,


17
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,889 line:-2
you would want to consider optimizing
not only for the language,


18
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:59,526 line:-1
but also for the directionality of the UI.


19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,364 line:-2
And this is because Arabic is a language
that is written from right to left.


20
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,967 line:-2
To understand this,
let's look at this example,


21
00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:11.104 line:-1 align:center
that says "The Arabian desert" in Arabic,


22
00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:15.108 line:-2 align:center
And as you see, it's written from
the right to the left of the screen.


23
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,611 line:-1
But this is not only it.


24
00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:20.247 line:-1 align:center
If this phrase exists in a layout,


25
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.084 line:-2 align:center
the entire layout flows
from top to bottom, right to left,


26
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:28,121 line:-2
to match the reading behavior
and direction of the language.


27
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,924 line:-2
This means that things like titles,
paragraphs,


28
00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:35.462 line:-2 align:center
columns, and even imagery
should flow from right to left.


29
00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:40.834 line:-2 align:center
And this directionality behavior
extends beyond the layout to also the UI.


30
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,805 line:-1
As in this example from the Pages app,


31
00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:49.643 line:-2 align:center
where the Navigation bar order
and direction is from right to left.


32
00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:53.213 line:-2 align:center
And the icons also flow
in the same direction.


33
00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:55.482 line:-2 align:center
And if you start navigating
through the app,


34
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:58,252 line:-1
you would find menus, controls,


35
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,953 line:-1
graphical elements,


36
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,990 line:-2
and even tables have been designed
to match the natural flow


37
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,893 line:-1
and behavior of the language.


38
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:09,229 line:-2
Now, you might think that this
could be a lot of work to optimize


39
00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:11.765 line:-1 align:center
your app or game to work with Arabic,


40
00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:15.302 line:-2 align:center
but the good news is, a lot of this
has been taken care of by Apple


41
00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:18.238 line:-2 align:center
if you use our native frameworks,
like Swift UI,


42
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:21,742 line:-2
so you can focus on the content
and few other UI details


43
00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:24.511 line:-2 align:center
that could be specific
to your app or game.


44
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,581 line:-2
And in today's session I will share
with you some of these aspects


45
00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:31.485 line:-2 align:center
that you should be looking at
while doing this optimization.


46
00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.520 line:-1 align:center
Starting by the UI directionality


47
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:37,024 line:-2
and example components
that you would want to consider.


48
00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:40.194 line:-2 align:center
Then we move to the Arabic script
main features


49
00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:44.765 line:-2 align:center
and the typography support
that Apple provides you for Arabic,


50
00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:46.466 line:-1 align:center
and how iconography is a detail


51
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.970 line:-2 align:center
that enhances
the overall Arabic experience.


52
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:55.175 line:-2 align:center
And at last, the numeral systems
supported by Apple for Arabic usage.


53
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,312 line:-1
Let's start by the UI directionality.


54
00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.781 line:-1 align:center
This is an example from the App Store.


55
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:04,318 line:-2
It is a flow that starts
by the story card in the Today tab,


56
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:08,789 line:-2
the story page, and it ends
with the product page of an app.


57
00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:11.358 line:-2 align:center
The best way to think about
layout directionality


58
00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.161 line:-1 align:center
is to turn it into wireframes.


59
00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.530 line:-2 align:center
For Arabic,
you would want to switch the placement


60
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,399 line:-1
of the UI components of these screens.


61
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,969 line:-2
Some of the elements would switch
from right to left,


62
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,072 line:-1
while others from left to right.


63
00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:30.711 line:-2 align:center
Titles, buttons, and the Navigation bar
should change order and position.


64
00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:34.081 line:-2 align:center
Paragraphs should be
always aligned to the right.


65
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:39,119 line:-2
Carousals and swipeable elements
should also flow from right to left.


66
00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.788 line:-2 align:center
After changing the placement
of the UI components,


67
00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:45.759 line:-2 align:center
localizing the content,
and keeping the images as they are,


68
00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:49.329 line:-2 align:center
now you have a layout
that flows from right to left.


69
00:03:49.363 --> 00:03:52.900 line:-2 align:center
Changing the layout directionality
is only the beginning of your journey


70
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,936 line:-2
to create an excellent
right-to-left behavior,


71
00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.604 line:-1 align:center
You would want to keep in mind


72
00:03:57.638 --> 00:04:01.475 line:-2 align:center
that the entire flow of the app
is now structured differently.


73
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:07,247 line:-2
And the user thinks about the navigation
between these pages in a reverse order.


74
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:10,584 line:-2
So mentally, they start
by the today tab on the right,


75
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,153 line:-1
then they navigate through the story card,


76
00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:16.089 line:-2 align:center
and they end with the product page
on the left side–


77
00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:20.694 line:-2 align:center
as if they are navigating
through an Arabic book from right to left.


78
00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:23.764 line:-2 align:center
And as I mentioned earlier,
all of this happens automatically


79
00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:26.500 line:-1 align:center
if you use our native frameworks.


80
00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:28.936 line:-2 align:center
Now I would like to share with you
some other examples


81
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,138 line:-2
for areas and components
that could be impacted


82
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:34.241 line:-1 align:center
by changing the directionality of the UI.


83
00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:38.245 line:-2 align:center
Let's look at this example
from the Weather app.


84
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,881 line:-2
On the left side
you see the English Layout,


85
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,117 line:-2
while the Arabic layout
in on the right side.


86
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,622 line:-2
The first thing that you would
notice here is content like images,


87
00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:51.725 line:-1 align:center
videos, and backgrounds remain the same.


88
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,995 line:-2
In this example,
the sun always rises from the east


89
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,631 line:-1
regardless the location or the language,


90
00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.566 line:-2 align:center
and you would want to avoid
flipping the content


91
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.036 line:-2 align:center
so it doesn't impact
the overall experience.


92
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:09,243 line:-2
The second component here is the carousal
of "the weather across the day".


93
00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:13.647 line:-2 align:center
Both, the interaction and the animation
of this component are inverted


94
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,583 line:-1
to match the UI direction.


95
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,720 line:-2
The third component that I would like
to share with you in the Weather app


96
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,488 line:-1
is the temperature scale.


97
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,124 line:-2
For Arabic, the lowest temperature
is on the right,


98
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,126 line:-1
while the highest is on the left.


99
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,662 line:-1
So as the scale gradient and indicator,


100
00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:31.899 line:-2 align:center
which we inverted
to match this behavior.


101
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,101 line:0
And as previously said,
the mental model


102
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:37,204 align:center
of switching between pages
is also reversed.


103
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,339 line:0
The primary page is on the far right,


104
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:42,576 line:0
and you navigate to secondary pages
on the left.


105
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:47,281 line:0
And therefore the pagination dots
should flow also from right to left.


106
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,150 line:-2
And our second example here
is from the Calendar app,


107
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,654 line:-2
in which the progress
and the flow of dates, months, and years


108
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,623 line:-2
is from right to left
when used in Arabic,


109
00:05:56,657 --> 00:06:01,495 line:-2
which matches the progress
of physical calendars in the Arab world.


110
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:05,432 line:-2
And it is always important to make sure
that your app is culturally relevant.


111
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,968 line:-2
In this example here
from the Calendar app,


112
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:12.072 line:-2 align:center
you may have noticed that there are
red lines beneath some dates.


113
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,008 line:-2
These are actually used to indicate
the beginning of each month


114
00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:16.777 line:-1 align:center
of the Islamic Lunar Calendar,


115
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.015 line:-2 align:center
which we have available for people
in the Arab and Islamic world.


116
00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:26.854 line:-2 align:center
The last example about directionality
is from the battery status in settings


117
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,457 line:-2
where toggles, segmented controllers,
design, and interaction


118
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,994 line:-1
are mirrored in the Arabic layout.


119
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,396 line:-1
And also Charts is another place


120
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,533 line:-2
where directionality could be impacted
in the UI–


121
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,902 line:-2
especially charts that include
a time component,


122
00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:45.539 line:-1 align:center
like days, weeks, months, or years.


123
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,140 line:-1
In the battery usage graph,


124
00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:50.010 line:-2 align:center
days of the week goes from left to right
in the English UI,


125
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,745 line:-1
while in Arabic it is preferred


126
00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:54.715 line:-2 align:center
to have the days progress
from right to left


127
00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:59.086 line:-2 align:center
to match the calendar behavior that we
referred to in the previous example.


128
00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:02.556 line:-2 align:center
Which means that the early time would be
on the right,


129
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,592 line:-1
and the late time is on the left.


130
00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:09.062 line:-2 align:center
And other charts and graphs in general
are dependent on the country,


131
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,198 line:-2
so you would want to double-check
before deciding


132
00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:14.535 line:-1 align:center
on which direction to use for charts.


133
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,904 line:-1
That was UI directionality.


134
00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.540 line:-1 align:center
Now let's talk about typography.


135
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:23,210 line:-2
But before we dive into the typefaces
and the typestyle adjustments


136
00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:26.813 line:-2 align:center
that you would want to consider
while designing your app,


137
00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:28.782 line:-2 align:center
let me take you through
a brief introduction


138
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,653 line:-2
about the Arabic script
and its main features.


139
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:36,623 line:-2
These are four letters
that spell the word "Arabic" in Arabic,


140
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:40,727 line:-2
but in writing they actually don't
mean anything on their own


141
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,896 line:-1
until they get connected.


142
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,999 line:-1
To understand this even more,


143
00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:49.970 line:-2 align:center
let me share with you how I would write
this word in a full Arabic sentence


144
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,439 line:-1
using the iOS keyboard.


145
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,585 line:-2
And as you see,
being connected doesn't mean


146
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,222 line:-2
that all the letters in a given word
would be linked.


147
00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:10.791 line:-1 align:center
So this word is made of two parts.


148
00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:13.794 line:-1 align:center
Each part has two characters.


149
00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:16.864 line:-2 align:center
And this is one of the main features
of the Arabic script–


150
00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:19.299 line:-1 align:center
the connected nature of it.


151
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,202 line:-2
And this also means
that the possible glyphs for each letter


152
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,138 line:-1
and each pair can be many.


153
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:29,209 line:-2
If we take the first letter here
in this example, the letter "Ain,"


154
00:08:29.243 --> 00:08:33.080 line:-2 align:center
its form changes based on its position
in the word,


155
00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:35.182 line:-1 align:center
whether it's isolated,


156
00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:37.217 line:-1 align:center
at the beginning of the word,


157
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:38.719 line:-1 align:center
in the middle,


158
00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:41.154 line:-1 align:center
or at the end.


159
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,925 line:-2
And it's worth noting that this
usually makes Arabic fonts libraries


160
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,894 line:-1
way bigger than Latin.


161
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,365 line:-2
Another feature of the Arabic script
that in most cases,


162
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,201 align:center
words are more concise than Latin


163
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,069 align:center
due to the connected nature
that tends to give


164
00:08:56,103 --> 00:09:00,140 line:0
a more condensed feel
to words and phrases.


165
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,442 line:-1
But it's also slightly taller,


166
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,378 line:-1
especially with the use of dots,


167
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:07.481 line:-1 align:center
vocalization, and diacritic marks.


168
00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:10.350 line:-2 align:center
Vocalization marks are used
to emphasize certain letters


169
00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:13.187 line:-2 align:center
or distinguish between words
that sound different


170
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,123 line:-2
but would otherwise be identical
in writing.


171
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,893 line:-2
And if your app would include
an intense use of vocalization marks,


172
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:24,431 line:-2
make sure to have more vertical spacing
in the UI to avoid clipping.


173
00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:28.869 line:-2 align:center
Now we understand the main differences
between Arabic and Latin.


174
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,607 line:-2
Let's talk about the typefaces that Apple
provides you if you use our system API.


175
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:38,345 line:0
Apple provides an exclusive
Arabic typeface that is designed carefully


176
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,748 align:center
with legibility and functionality in mind.


177
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:45,652 line:0
It is also designed to be consistent
with the Latin SF family style


178
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:49,523 align:center
to make if feel natural
in bilingual contexts.


179
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,693 align:center
And similar to Latin,
SF Arabic also provides you


180
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,696 line:0
with all possible weights
that you may need in your app.


181
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,232 line:-1
from Ultralight to Black.


182
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:02,536 line:-2
You can see the usage of different weights
in many places in our native apps.


183
00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:05.606 line:-1 align:center
The Clock app is a good example for that;


184
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,108 line:-1
using Bold in the title,


185
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,644 line:-1
Regular for the different cities,


186
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,280 line:-1
and Light for the clock numerals.


187
00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:15.582 line:-2 align:center
You can explore more apps
in our ecosystem


188
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,051 line:-1
to see how different weights can be used.


189
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,189 line:-2
Like the Health app where bold,
medium, and regular


190
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,359 line:-1
are used in titles and body copy.


191
00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:30.063 line:-2 align:center
And the Weather app where multiple weights
are used in numerals and body copy.


192
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,935 line:-2
SF Arabic also has been made
with scalability in mind.


193
00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:38.906 line:-2 align:center
Which means that its form changes slightly
depending on the point size.


194
00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:41.842 line:-1 align:center
And this is what we call optical size.


195
00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:43.710 line:-2 align:center
You can see
the structural differences here


196
00:10:43.744 --> 00:10:47.047 line:-2 align:center
between the largest
and the smallest point sizes.


197
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,417 line:-2
Large is usually used
for titles and headings.


198
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:55.923 line:-2 align:center
And is designed to match the contemporary
grotesque feel of the rest of SF Family.


199
00:10:55.956 --> 00:10:57.958 line:-1 align:center
On the other hand, smaller point sizes,


200
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,427 line:-2
which are used in paragraphs
and body copy,


201
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.766 line:-2 align:center
are designed to prioritize legibility
and functionality over style.


202
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,036 line:-2
This happens by adding angularity
to the terminals,


203
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:13,540 line:-2
width and contrast
to the overall font structure.


204
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:16,543 line:-2
It's worth noting that the system
takes care of this.


205
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:21,048 line:-2
It is automatically choosing the
right form depending on the point size.


206
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,751 line:-2
Here is an example from
the App Store Editorial sheet,


207
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:29,923 line:-2
where we use display in the title,
and text is used in paragraphs.


208
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:32,793 line:-2
And in both you could see how
Arabic and English typefaces


209
00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:35.395 line:-1 align:center
work seamlessly in this bilingual context.


210
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,567 line:-2
SF Arabic Scalable typeface
is used across our ecosystem,


211
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:44,204 line:-2
but it's also available for you
to use in your app or game.


212
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:48,475 line:-2
And this year we're introducing
SF Arabic Rounded to the SF family,


213
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:52.379 line:-2 align:center
including all its various weights,
from Ultralight to Black.


214
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.549 line:-1 align:center
Here is an example from the Reminders app


215
00:11:55.582 --> 00:12:00.621 line:-2 align:center
where we use SF Arabic Rounded
in the titles and the body text.


216
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,924 line:-2
And as you see, Rounded could
give your app a more practical,


217
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,127 line:-2
active, or softer look,
depending on the context.


218
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:12,266 line:-2
The usage of the Rounded typeface,
the several weights,


219
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:17,538 line:-2
and the scalability of SF Arabic
can all be seen in all of our native apps,


220
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,339 line:-1
and we can't wait for you to use them


221
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:23,043 line:-2
to create the best possible experiences
for the Arab users.


222
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,379 line:0
If you would like to learn more
about all the new fonts


223
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,782 align:center
that have been announced this year,
including SF Arabic Rounded,


224
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,684 line:0
make sure to watch this year's session


225
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,388 line:0
"Meet the expanded
San Francisco font family".


226
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.857 line:-2 align:center
Now let's talk about
some typestyle considerations


227
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.760 line:-1 align:center
when using Arabic typefaces.


228
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,229 line:-1
Arabic is a non-case sensitive script.


229
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:47.301 line:-2 align:center
Digital Arabic fonts are usually designed
to match the lower case Latin.


230
00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:51.171 line:-2 align:center
But when uppercase is used,
it gives Latin more volume


231
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:54,875 line:-2
and it makes Arabic feels smaller
in comparison to Latin.


232
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:58,111 line:-2
To compensate for this this
optical size difference in the UI,


233
00:12:58.145 --> 00:13:02.716 line:-2 align:center
you may want to increase
the Arabic font size by 10%.


234
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,819 line:-2
This subtle difference would also help
with legibility


235
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:10,123 line:-2
especially when upper case is used
in smaller point sizes.


236
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:13,093 line:0
The other thing to consider
is letter spacing.


237
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,529 line:0
Given the fact that Arabic is connected,


238
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,565 align:center
some Arabic typefaces
are not fully optimized


239
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,901 line:0
to deal properly with spacing.


240
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:24,204 align:center
This can result
in showing misplaced links,


241
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,806 align:center
breaking letters apart,


242
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,342 align:center
or showing unnecessary spacing.


243
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,312 line:0
If the Arabic typeface you're using
isn't fully optimized for letter spacing,


244
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:34,915 align:center
make sure to use 0 tracking.


245
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:39,419 align:center
or simply, use our system font,
which adds the correct letters linkage.


246
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:42,289 line:0
This linkage in Arabic
is called "Kashida"


247
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,858 line:0
and the system adds Kashidas
with different lengths


248
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:49,029 align:center
to have more organic
natural spacing in Arabic.


249
00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:52.432 line:-2 align:center
The last thing to look out for
is transparency.


250
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:55,469 align:center
Sometimes you can see visible joints
between letters.


251
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,505 align:center
This often happens
if there is transparency in a font


252
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:02,509 line:0
or a system
that is not fully optimized for Arabic.


253
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,478 line:0
Thankfully, if you use our system font,


254
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,346 line:0
you don't have to worry about this.


255
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,283 align:center
Opacity is applied to the entire word
or phrase


256
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,985 line:0
to overcome any potential distortion.


257
00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:14.788 line:-2 align:center
In the typography section,
I talked about the main features


258
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,356 line:-1
of the Arabic script,


259
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,059 line:-2
the Arabic typefaces
that we use in our ecosystem,


260
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,529 line:-2
and some considerations
for certain type treatments in Arabic.


261
00:14:22.563 --> 00:14:25.599 line:-1 align:center
Now let's talk about iconography.


262
00:14:25.632 --> 00:14:29.937 line:-2 align:center
Iconography is one of the UI elements
that could be easily missed,


263
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.373 line:-2 align:center
but they are usually the entry point
to a user flow


264
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:35,742 line:-1
or a trigger to a certain action,


265
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:38,745 line:-2
which makes having the correct iconography
crucial


266
00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:40.914 line:-1 align:center
to having a seamless experience.


267
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,883 line:-2
For Arabic,
we are committed to choosing


268
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,286 line:-2
the most relevant symbols
for our customers.


269
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,791 line:-2
Let's take the App Store tab bar icons
as an example.


270
00:14:50.824 --> 00:14:55.929 line:-2 align:center
Some symbols have been tweaked, while
others remained the same in the Arabic UI.


271
00:14:55,963 --> 00:15:00,000 line:-2
And to understand why we made this choice,
let's look at some of them.


272
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:06,406 line:-2
The Today tab symbol, for example,
symbolizes text direction,


273
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,078 line:-2
and it is more relevant for Arabic users
to have the lines aligned to the right


274
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,715 line:-2
to match the natural reading direction
of the language.


275
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:19,553 line:-2
While the magnifying glass's direction
implies the angle of the right hand usage,


276
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,823 line:-2
which is the behavior of
the majority of users in the world,


277
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,491 line:-1
regardless their location


278
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:27,594 line:-2
so we decided to keep it as it is
in the Arabic UI.


279
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,798 line:-2
And here some other examples
from other apps


280
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:35,402 line:-2
that shows how directionality
can impact the way symbols are treated


281
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,604 line:-1
in an Arabic UI,


282
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:42,609 line:-2
like writing from right to left while
maintaining the angularity of the pen


283
00:15:42.643 --> 00:15:46.880 line:-2 align:center
or changing the speaker's direction
to make it feel natural in the UI


284
00:15:46.914 --> 00:15:49.016 line:-1 align:center
while maintaining the slash direction,


285
00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:53.120 line:-2 align:center
which is consistent
across our Apple ecosystem,


286
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,556 line:-2
or changing the direction
of the calendar dots


287
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,025 line:-1
that represent the progress of months


288
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,260 line:-1
while keeping the clock hands as they are


289
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:03,830 line:-2
to match the physical clock representation
in the system.


290
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:07,701 line:-2
And on top of directionality,
having more locally relevant symbols


291
00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:11.371 line:-2 align:center
is another layer that we're dedicated
to enhancing over time


292
00:16:11.405 --> 00:16:14.908 line:-2 align:center
to ensure excellence
in our international markets.


293
00:16:14.942 --> 00:16:17.778 line:-2 align:center
And here are few examples
for Arabic specific symbols


294
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.680 line:-1 align:center
from the SF symbols library,


295
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:23,050 line:-2
including an exclusively drawn
Arabic signature symbol


296
00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.953 line:-1 align:center
and other text formatting ones.


297
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:30,657 line:-2
All of this and more than 300 Arabic
and right-to-left symbols can be found


298
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:33,060 line:-1
in SF Symbols app.


299
00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:35.629 line:-1 align:center
In the app you can easily choose a symbol


300
00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:39.199 line:-2 align:center
and check the localization section
in the info panel


301
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:43,804 line:-2
to see the Arabic local variant
and other non-Latin scripts.


302
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:47,274 line:-2
All of the right-to-left and the local
symbols should appear automatically


303
00:16:47.307 --> 00:16:50.477 line:-2 align:center
in your app
if you use our system API.


304
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:55,516 line:-2
As we saw, using the right symbols
can transform the entire app experience,


305
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,718 line:-1
as it becomes more relevant to the users.


306
00:16:57.751 --> 00:17:01.355 line:-2 align:center
And especially for countries
and regions that use a non-Latin script,


307
00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:03.123 line:-1 align:center
we need to pay more attention,


308
00:17:03.156 --> 00:17:07.594 line:-2 align:center
as sometimes we forget about the different
linguistic and cultural nuances.


309
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:09,997 line:-1
And I really hope to see your contribution


310
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,800 line:-2
in creating the most relevant icons
for the Arabic customers.


311
00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:16.837 line:-1 align:center
Now let's talk about Arabic numerals.


312
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.406 line:-1 align:center
The numerals that we're all familiar with


313
00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:24.811 line:-2 align:center
and are used in most countries around
the world are called Arabic numerals.


314
00:17:24.845 --> 00:17:27.814 line:-2 align:center
And this is because they were
invented in the Arab world


315
00:17:27.848 --> 00:17:30.751 line:-2 align:center
and they replaced
the Roman numerals back then.


316
00:17:31.852 --> 00:17:34.054 line:-1 align:center
And you can notice that until today


317
00:17:34.087 --> 00:17:37.824 line:-2 align:center
all mathematical calculations happens
from right to left,


318
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:41,728 line:-2
matching the reading behavior
of the Arabic language.


319
00:17:41.762 --> 00:17:45.866 line:-2 align:center
Like this example which starts
the summation process by ones,


320
00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:49.670 line:-1 align:center
then tens, then hundreds.


321
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:55,275 line:-2
In today's world this form of numerals
is called Western Arabic numerals,


322
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,912 line:-2
and that is to contrast it
with the other form of Arabic numerals


323
00:17:58.946 --> 00:18:01.114 line:-1 align:center
which is the Eastern one.


324
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,851 line:-2
Both forms have been invented
in the Arab world


325
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:07,421 line:-2
and are currently used
in different Arab countries.


326
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,924 line:-2
The Western Arabic numerals is used
in West African Arab countries


327
00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:14.795 line:-1 align:center
like Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia,


328
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:19,566 line:-2
while the Eastern is used in
some Levantine and gulf countries.


329
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,337 line:-2
Countries like Egypt or Saudi Arabia
uses both versions.


330
00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:27.407 line:-2 align:center
Choosing between both systems
happens automatically


331
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,543 line:-1
according to the user's country,


332
00:18:29.576 --> 00:18:32.513 line:-2 align:center
and also can be triggered
by the user choice.


333
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,581 line:-2
And you can see a reflection
of this choice


334
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:38,752 line:-2
in the all apps that uses numerals
in our ecosystem.


335
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,288 line:-1
Including Calculator app,


336
00:18:41.321 --> 00:18:43.490 line:-1 align:center
and the Calendar app,


337
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:46,493 line:-2
and the Typograph watch face
that is beautifully designed


338
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,862 line:-1
in both numeral forms.


339
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:53,400 line:-2
And many other watch faces that you can
check in our watch face gallery.


340
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,370 line:-2
If the app that you're developing
includes numerals,


341
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,906 line:-1
make sure to count for both forms


342
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:01,041 line:-1
or to check which country you're targeting


343
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,944 line:-2
to validate which form
would be more suitable.


344
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,713 line:-2
And at last, if you would like to have
more design guidance


345
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:08,682 line:-1
for right-to-left languages,


346
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,918 line:-2
please refer to
our Right to Left guidelines


347
00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:14.154 line:-1 align:center
in the Human Interface Guidelines.


348
00:19:14.188 --> 00:19:17.291 line:-1 align:center
Today I talked about Designing in Arabic,


349
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:22,095 line:-2
including the impact that the language
can have on the UI directionality.


350
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:23,931 line:-1
And in the typography section,


351
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:27,034 line:-2
I gave an introduction
about the Arabic script,


352
00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:32.172 line:-2 align:center
the typefaces,
and some Arabic UI type considerations.


353
00:19:32.206 --> 00:19:34.374 line:-1 align:center
I also talked about iconography


354
00:19:34.408 --> 00:19:37.578 line:-2 align:center
and how it can
transform your app experience,


355
00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:40.714 line:-1 align:center
the Arabic numerals in its both forms,


356
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:42,749 line:-1
and the Right to Left Guidelines.


357
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:47,421 align:center
And if you would like to even dive deeper
into how to get all of this right


358
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,556 align:center
from a development perspective,


359
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,660 line:0
you can also check this year's session
"Get it Right (to Left)".


360
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,096 line:-1
I hope all of this gave you guidance


361
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:57,831 line:-1
and pointed you at the right tools


362
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:02,369 line:-2
to start designing or optimizing
your app to be used in the Arab world.


363
00:20:02.402 --> 00:20:06.673 line:-2 align:center
And I can't wait to use all the amazing
Arabic apps that you're going to build.
