00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,545
Hi, folks. My name is Pavlo.


5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,913
I work on security technologies


6
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,682
that help keep you
and your users safe.


7
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,684
Today I'm going to tell you
about some upcoming changes


8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,920
that may impact the way
you develop, test,


9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,756
and deploy your applications.


10
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,292
First, I want to tell you
what Developer Mode is,


11
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,661
the reasoning behind
why it was created,


12
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,363
the security benefit it brings,


13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,766
and the workflows
that it will affect.


14
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,835
Then, we will discuss
when and how


15
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,337
to turn on Developer Mode.


16
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:40,107
And then we will finish off
this session with a walk-through


17
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,442
of the tools we built
to support automation flows


18
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,144
for when you're working
with many devices,


19
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,214
like in a testing lab
environment.


20
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,783
OK, so what is Developer Mode?


21
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,886
It's a new mode in iOS 16
and watchOS 9


22
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,956
that enables common
developer workflows.


23
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:58,125
Developer Mode
is disabled by default


24
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,460
and requires you
to explicitly enroll the device


25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,862
into Developer Mode.


26
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:05,732
Your enrollment persists across
reboots and system updates.


27
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,434
And of course,
we have built tools


28
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,369
that enable you to automate
Developer Mode setup


29
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,171
if you want.


30
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,806
A natural question
you will have is,


31
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,909
"Why are we introducing
Developer Mode?"


32
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,011
The reason is that
powerful developer features


33
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,280
are being abused
in targeted attacks.


34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,882
Meanwhile,
the vast majority of users


35
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,817
do not need such functionality


36
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,353
and so they shouldn't
be enabled by default.


37
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,655
This way we can retain
the development capabilities


38
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,425
that you rely on and increase
the security for users


39
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,895
with mitigations that otherwise
would get in your way.


40
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,063
Now having said that,


41
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:39,132
most common distribution flows
will not require Developer Mode.


42
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,635
For example, deploying your
application through TestFlight


43
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,570
or using Enterprise
in-house distribution


44
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,606
does not require Developer Mode.


45
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,775
And of course,
distributing your applications


46
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,145
through the App Store
does not require Developer Mode.


47
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,281
It's only required for when you,
the developer,


48
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,884
are actively developing
your application on your device.


49
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,920
All right, by this point
I'm sure you can't wait


50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,688
until I tell you
how you would get started


51
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,223
with using Developer Mode.


52
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,659
So let's go through when you
need to turn on Developer Mode


53
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,794
and how to do it.


54
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,597
You should turn Developer Mode
on if you need to


55
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,866
run and install development
signed applications,


56
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,069
including applications signed
by using a Personal Team;


57
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,438
debug and instrument
your applications;


58
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:23,043
or you want to use testing
automation on your device.


59
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,878
Turning on Developer Mode
is straightforward,


60
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,381
but first you need to connect
your device to Xcode


61
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:30,617
for the Developer Mode
menu item to appear.


62
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,119
The beta releases
that you have downloaded


63
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:36,390
will have the menu item always
visible for the time being.


64
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,992
Installing a development-signed
application without Xcode,


65
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,327
like through Apple Configurator,


66
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,397
will also make
the menu item visible.


67
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,732
Once you've done that, you can
find the Developer Mode controls


68
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,803
under Privacy & Security
in Settings.


69
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,105
And for automation,
you can use the new devmodectl


70
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,408
that ships by default
on macOS Ventura,


71
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,943
but more on that later.


72
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,445
OK, so let's walk through


73
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,280
with how you would turn on
Developer Mode.


74
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,049
In front of me,
I have an iPhone 13 Pro


75
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,984
that I just picked up
to run my code on.


76
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,652
First, I'm going
to plug it in to my Mac


77
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,555
that has Xcode already running.


78
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,024
As you can see, Xcode recognizes
that this device


79
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,126
does not have
Developer Mode enabled


80
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:17,564
and will prevent me
from running this application.


81
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,433
But now that
I have plugged it in,


82
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:25,505
I can go into Settings,
Privacy & Security,


83
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,008
Developer Mode.


84
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,911
Turning on Developer Mode


85
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,612
requires that you reboot
your device,


86
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,215
so let's go ahead and do that.


87
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,985
Once the device has rebooted,


88
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,222
you will be prompted once again
to confirm your decision.


89
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,893
Once you tap Turn On,
you will be good to go.


90
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:52,466
Now, Xcode sees that the device
has Developer Mode enabled,


91
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,168
and I can run my application.


92
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,774
While this flow works
when you're working


93
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:01,842
with a single device,


94
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,210
this process
can be time consuming


95
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,145
if you're dealing
with multiple devices.


96
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,379
For this reason,
we've built tools


97
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,382
that help you automate
this process.


98
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,451
Automation flows
have one limitation:


99
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,886
only devices without a passcode


100
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,789
can have Developer Mode
automatically enabled.


101
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,424
This is because
when you restart your iPhone


102
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,892
you need to unlock your device


103
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,761
before your device
can be interacted with.


104
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,063
To support automation,


105
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,632
macOS Ventura
ships with devmodectl


106
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,634
that you can use to either
enable Developer Mode


107
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,669
on a single device
that you have already connected,


108
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,805
or in Streaming Mode
that will automatically turn on


109
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,708
Developer Mode
on all devices that you plug in.


110
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,880
Here I have two devices
plugged into my Mac.


111
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,351
They don't have passcodes,


112
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,853
and I don't want to manually
set up Developer Mode on them.


113
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,991
So I'm going to run devmodectl
with the streaming subcommand.


114
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,093
This will automatically reboot
the connected devices


115
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:56,963
and set up Developer Mode.


116
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,465
Once Developer Mode
has been set up,


117
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,368
you will get a notification
on the device.


118
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:08,041
And now these devices
are good to go.


119
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,477
All right, that's all I have
for you today.


120
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,013
To wrap it up,
in iOS 16 and watchOS 9


121
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,481
you will have to enable
Developer Mode


122
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,082
to perform common
development activities


123
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,419
like deploying and debugging
your applications.


124
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,321
And if you need to automate
Developer Mode setup,


125
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,392
you can use devmodectl,
which ships in macOS Ventura.


126
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,360
If you want to learn more
about security changes


127
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,696
that may impact your
macOS distribution workflows,


128
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,033
check out the "What's new in
notarization for Mac apps" talk.


129
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,734
I hope you have
a great rest of your day


130
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,902
and happy coding!
