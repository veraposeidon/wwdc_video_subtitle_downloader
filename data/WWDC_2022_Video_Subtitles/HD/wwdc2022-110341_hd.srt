00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.979 line:-1 align:center
Hello and welcome to WWDC.


4
00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.014 line:-1 align:center
My name is Ajay Singh,


5
00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:17.184 line:-2 align:center
and today I am excited to take you
on a journey


6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,487 line:-1
to explore SMS message filters.


7
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:24.391 line:-2 align:center
These allow you to create
message filter extensions


8
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:29,196 line:-2
which help people categorize incoming
SMS messages


9
00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.798 line:-1 align:center
from unknown senders.


10
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:37,504 line:-2
First, I will describe how
SMS message filters work.


11
00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:43.477 line:-2 align:center
Next, I will talk about
what's new in iOS 16.


12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,883 line:-2
I will walk through an example of how
to build a message filter extension


13
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,920 line:-1
using iOS 16 APIs,


14
00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:57.157 line:-2 align:center
then show you what people will see
in Messages


15
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,527 line:-1
when they use your extension.


16
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,031 line:-1
Finally, I will talk about enhancements


17
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,167 line:-1
to Apple's SMS filter for India.


18
00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:11.505 line:-1 align:center
Let's talk about SMS message filters.


19
00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:17.811 line:-2 align:center
In many countries,
SMS messages are now used by businesses


20
00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:21.315 line:-1 align:center
to notify customers about transactions,


21
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:25,452 line:-2
marketing campaigns,
alerts, and reminders.


22
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:30,858 line:-2
In this example you
can see a mix of SMS messages


23
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.160 line:-1 align:center
including short codes,


24
00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:37.431 line:-2 align:center
alphanumeric codes,
and standard phone numbers.


25
00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.901 line:-1 align:center
This results in a very cluttered inbox,


26
00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.571 line:-2 align:center
and it's really difficult
to find personal messages


27
00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.306 line:-1 align:center
from your loved ones.


28
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:54,414 line:-2
iOS does provide an option
to filter messages from unknown senders,


29
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:58,018 line:-2
but if you receive several messages
each day,


30
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:02.589 line:-2 align:center
even the unknown sender folder
will quickly get filled


31
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:04.625 line:-1 align:center
with unread messages.


32
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:10,731 line:-2
Automated filtering of SMS messages
is important to many people,


33
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,433 line:-1
and iOS provides a secure


34
00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.503 line:-1 align:center
sandbox-based extension model


35
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:21,675 line:-2
that allow you to further classify
messages from unknown senders.


36
00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:28.215 line:-2 align:center
People can find and install
SMS filter apps from the App Store.


37
00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:32.819 line:-2 align:center
Once installed,
you can turn on message filtering


38
00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:36.723 line:-1 align:center
by going to Settings, Messages,


39
00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:42.663 line:-2 align:center
Unknown & Spam,
and turning on Filter Unknown Senders.


40
00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:47.601 line:-2 align:center
Then, you can select
your SMS filter of choice.


41
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:51,205 line:-1
Here we have installed two SMS filters.


42
00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:56.376 line:-2 align:center
Note that only one filter
can be active at a time.


43
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,781 line:-1
In iOS 14 and later,


44
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:04,484 line:-1
new folders will appear in Messages


45
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:09,122 line:-1
for Transactions, Promotions, and Junk.


46
00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:14.661 line:-2 align:center
These folders help people organize
and find messages


47
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,397 line:-1
that are most relevant to them.


48
00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:20.534 line:-1 align:center
Regardless of which filter is chosen,


49
00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:25.205 line:-2 align:center
Messages provide
the same classification structure


50
00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.810 line:-2 align:center
consisting of Transactions,
Promotions, and Junk.


51
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,913 line:-1
We have heard from you loud and clear,


52
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:37,217 line:-2
that you would like to provide
more detailed classifications.


53
00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:42.523 line:-2 align:center
So in iOS 16
we are introducing enhancements


54
00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:46.159 line:-1 align:center
to the filter classification API.


55
00:03:46.193 --> 00:03:49.696 line:-1 align:center
Now your SMS message filter extension


56
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.701 line:-2 align:center
can classify messages
into 12 additional sub-categories.


57
00:03:55,736 --> 00:04:00,140 line:-2
Here are the new sub-categories
that you can specify


58
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:03,911 line:-1
in your SMS filter extension.


59
00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:09.516 line:-2 align:center
The new sub-categories fall under
the existing top level categories–


60
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.819 line:-1 align:center
Transactions and Promotions.


61
00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:16.223 line:-2 align:center
Now you can further refine
incoming messages


62
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:19.593 line:-1 align:center
and provide an even better experience.


63
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,796 line:-1
For example, in markets like India,


64
00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:26.500 line:-2 align:center
it's common to receive
a large number of messages


65
00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:29.536 line:-1 align:center
related to financial transactions.


66
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.140 line:-2 align:center
These include activities
in their bank account


67
00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:36.443 line:-1 align:center
and alerts for credit card spending.


68
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,514 line:-2
These messages can now
be nicely organized


69
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:44,952 line:-2
in the Finance sub-folder
under Transactions.


70
00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:50.557 line:-2 align:center
Let's see how the flow works
for SMS message filters.


71
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,994 line:-1
We can divide the flow into two phases;


72
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:58,332 line:-1
configuration and runtime classification.


73
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,734 line:-1
In the configuration phase,


74
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:05,072 line:-2
users select your message filter
in Settings.


75
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:10,644 line:-2
This triggers a new API
introduced in iOS 16


76
00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:15.382 line:-2 align:center
to request the capabilities
supported by your filter.


77
00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:20.454 line:-2 align:center
You can now respond with a list
of supported categories


78
00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.489 line:-1 align:center
and sub-categories.


79
00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:26.159 line:-2 align:center
In this example,
the filter reports


80
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,296 line:-1
that it supports the sub-categories


81
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:33.634 line:-1 align:center
Finance, Orders, and Coupons.


82
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,904 line:-1
iOS validates these capabilities


83
00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:40.073 line:-1 align:center
and updates the inbox in Messages


84
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:43,310 line:-1
with the appropriate folders.


85
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.413 line:-1 align:center
In the runtime classification phase,


86
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:52,286 line:-2
every time an SMS message is received
from an unknown sender,


87
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,621 line:-1
iOS queries your filter


88
00:05:54.655 --> 00:06:00.327 line:-2 align:center
to determine which category
and sub-category it belongs to.


89
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,732 line:0
You can also see the terms
action and sub-action used here.


90
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:10,037 line:0
Filters must respond with
one of the capabilities declared


91
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.472 line:-1 align:center
in the configuration phase.


92
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,709 align:center
The SMS message will then appear


93
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:20,047 line:0
in the corresponding sub-folder
in Messages.


94
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.251 line:-2 align:center
Let's build
a simple message filter extension


95
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:28,055 line:-1
to see how the APIs are used


96
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,658 line:-1
and what people will see in Messages.


97
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,829 line:-1
In Xcode, you start by creating


98
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:39,933 line:-1
a new Message Filter Extension target.


99
00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:45.772 line:-2 align:center
The Message Filter Extension target
appears as one of the options


100
00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:48.509 line:-1 align:center
when you create a new target


101
00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:51.311 line:-1 align:center
and go to template selection.


102
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:56,316 line:-2
Select the Message Filter Extension
and click Next.


103
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.054 line:-2 align:center
Now give your filter a name
and click Finish.


104
00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.591 line:-1 align:center
When the target is created,


105
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:09,630 line:-2
MessageFilterExtension.swift
will be auto-populated


106
00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:12.065 line:-1 align:center
with all the required functions.


107
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,203 line:-1
In iOS 16, we have a new API handle


108
00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:19.573 line:-1 align:center
called capabilitiesRequest.


109
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:24,578 line:-2
Fill in the
ILMessageFilterCapabilitiesQueryResponse


110
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:29.816 line:-2 align:center
structure with the transactional
or promotional sub-actions


111
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.518 line:-1 align:center
that you support.


112
00:07:31.552 --> 00:07:35.689 line:-1 align:center
You can specify up to five sub-actions.


113
00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:39.860 line:-2 align:center
Here we are indicating support
for Finance,


114
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:44,498 line:-2
Orders, and Health sub-actions
under Transactions,


115
00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:49.670 line:-2 align:center
and Coupons and Offers sub-actions
under Promotions.


116
00:07:49.703 --> 00:07:53.307 line:-2 align:center
Now build and install
your filter extension.


117
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,844 line:-1
When you choose your filter in Settings,


118
00:07:56.877 --> 00:08:00.047 line:-1 align:center
the Message inbox will be updated


119
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.383 line:-1 align:center
with the sub-actions we declared;


120
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:09,523 line:-2
Finance, Orders, and Health appear
under Transactions,


121
00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:15.495 line:-2 align:center
and Coupons and Offers
appear under Promotions.


122
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.634 line:-2 align:center
Now, we have confirmed
that our configuration works.


123
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,370 line:-1
Let's define some simple logic


124
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,974 line:-1
to return suitable categories to iOS


125
00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:31.445 line:-1 align:center
when an incoming SMS message is received.


126
00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:38.485 line:-2 align:center
First, we extract the message body text
from the queryRequest object.


127
00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:42.356 line:-1 align:center
If the message contains specific keywords,


128
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:47.628 line:-2 align:center
we return a suitable matching action
and sub-action.


129
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:53,166 line:-2
Here, we have added the code
where if the keyword is debited


130
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.171 line:-2 align:center
then we will return filterAction
as Transaction


131
00:08:57.204 --> 00:09:02.075 line:-2 align:center
and filterSubaction
as transactionalfinance.


132
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:06,713 line:-2
Similarly, when the message has
the keyword coupon,


133
00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:12.252 line:-2 align:center
then Promotion and PromotionalCoupons
will be returned.


134
00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:15.088 line:-1 align:center
You can also update the business logic


135
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:21,361 line:-2
for other sub classifications within
Transactions and Promotions.


136
00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:25.566 line:-2 align:center
Note that if you return
an incorrect combination


137
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:29,336 line:-1
for filterAction and filterSubAction,


138
00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:32.072 line:-1 align:center
iOS will discard the sub-action


139
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,808 line:-1
and only honor the action.


140
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:39,680 line:-2
For example,
if we return the action Transaction


141
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,982 line:-1
and sub-action Coupons,


142
00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:47.321 line:-2 align:center
then the message will only go
to the All Transaction folder.


143
00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:53.560 line:-2 align:center
Here, we have an example
of SMS received from bank


144
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,963 line:-1
with the keyword "debited"


145
00:09:55.996 --> 00:10:00.400 line:-2 align:center
and it has been classified
under Finance sub-folder by Messages.


146
00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.738 line:-1 align:center
Here is another example


147
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:10,511 line:-2
where we have received a Black Friday Deal
with the keyword "coupon."


148
00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:15.716 line:-2 align:center
In Messages it has been classified
under the Coupons sub-folder.


149
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,255 line:-2
In iOS 16,
you can choose sub-categories


150
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,492 line:-2
that are the best fit
for your user demographics.


151
00:10:25.526 --> 00:10:31.031 line:-2 align:center
In the first example, the SMS message
filter shows folders


152
00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:34.735 line:-1 align:center
for Orders, Reminders, Health,


153
00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:40.007 line:-2 align:center
Public Services, and Weather
under Transactions,


154
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,279 line:-2
while the second example shows
folders for Finance,


155
00:10:45.312 --> 00:10:48.615 line:-1 align:center
Reminders, Health, and Rewards


156
00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:50.517 line:-1 align:center
under Transactions


157
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:53.954 line:-1 align:center
and Offers under Promotions.


158
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:58,458 line:-2
Your filter extension can use
these sub-categories


159
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:03,630 line:-2
to provide a differentiated experience
for your users.


160
00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:08.035 line:-1 align:center
Apple provides an SMS filter in India,


161
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:13,841 line:-2
and we have updated it
using the enhancements in iOS 16.


162
00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:17.277 line:-1 align:center
The Apple SMS filter in India


163
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:20.814 line:-1 align:center
