3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,744 line:-1
Hello and welcome.


4
00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.747 line:-2 align:center
I'm Galo Avila,
engineering manager in GPU Software.


5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,782 line:-2
In this session,
Eylon and I are excited to share


6
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:19,353 line:-2
how you can improve your app's GPU
binary generation with Metal 3.


7
00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.222 line:-2 align:center
First, I'll describe
how offline compilation can help you


8
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,660 line:-2
reduce in app stutters,
first launch, and new level load times.


9
00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:30.364 line:-2 align:center
Then Eylon will explain how you can use
the optimize for size compiler option,


10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:34,067 line:-2
to tune code expanding transformations
and improve your compile times.


11
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:39,873 line:-2
Offline compilation lets you move GPU
binary generation to project build time.


12
00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:43.443 line:-2 align:center
To fully understand the benefits adoption
can bring to your Metal application,


13
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:47,948 line:-2
I'll start by reviewing the ways in which
you can already generate a GPU binary.


14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:52,920 line:-2
In your Metal app, GPU binary generation
happens both at build time and runtime.


15
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:56,924 line:-2
For example, suppose you instantiate
a metal library from source.


16
00:00:56.957 --> 00:01:00.127 line:-2 align:center
This generates at app runtime
Apple's Intermediate Representation,


17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,129 line:-1
also known as AIR.


18
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,298 line:-1
This can be a CPU intensive operation,


19
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:05.699 line:-1 align:center
which you can move to app build time


20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,202 line:-2
by pre-compiling your source
to a Metal library,


21
00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:11.171 line:-1 align:center
and instantiating from a file instead.


22
00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:14.575 line:-2 align:center
Once your Metal library is in memory,
creating a Pipeline State Descriptor


23
00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:18.278 line:-2 align:center
containing state and functions
is a lightweight operation.


24
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,280 line:-2
Until you create
your pipeline state object,


25
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,850 line:-2
which can be another
CPU intensive operation,


26
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:26,220 line:-2
where just-in-time
GPU binary generation takes place.


27
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:32,759 line:-2
Since GPU binary generation at runtime
can be a CPU intensive operation,


28
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:36,063 line:-2
Metal helps you speed up
pipeline state object creation.


29
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,431 line:-1
When you instantiate a PSO,


30
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:41,235 line:-2
Metal stores your GPU binaries
in its file system cache.


31
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,337 line:-1
And every time a new PSO is created,


32
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.373 line:-1 align:center
any newly generated functions are added.


33
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,976 line:-2
So any previously generated binaries
that are referenced


34
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,577 line:-1
will be loaded from the cache.


35
00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:56.316 line:-2 align:center
Metal also lets you explicitly control
when and where GPU binaries are cached


36
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.519 line:-1 align:center
using Binary Archives.


37
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:03,156 line:-2
Simply use a PSO descriptor
to cache a GPU binary in an archive,


38
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,526 line:-1
as many times as you need.


39
00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:09.630 line:-2 align:center
Then your PSO creation becomes
a lightweight operation.


40
00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:11.965 line:-2 align:center
Binary archives enable
more flexible caching,


41
00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.668 line:-2 align:center
but they still have to be
generated at runtime.


42
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.236 line:-2 align:center
In many cases,
what you really want


43
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,438 line:-2
is to generate those archives
at build time,


44
00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.474 line:-1 align:center
and now you finally can.


45
00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:23.610 line:-2 align:center
With offline binary generation,
you specify a new artifact


46
00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:26.280 line:-2 align:center
at project build time
called Metal pipelines script,


47
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,550 line:-2
along with Metal source
or a Metal library.


48
00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:32.152 line:-2 align:center
A pipelines script
is your compiler toolchain equivalent


49
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:35,222 line:-2
to a collection of pipeline descriptors
in the API.


50
00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.659 line:-2 align:center
The output of your compilation process
is a binary archive.


51
00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:42.029 line:-2 align:center
No further GPU code generation
takes place at app runtime.


52
00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:46.600 line:-2 align:center
Merely load your binary archive built
offline to accelerate your PSO creation.


53
00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:52.339 line:-2 align:center
Offline compilation benefits your app
by reducing runtime CPU overhead,


54
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,876 line:-2
which is at the core
of what makes Metal a low level API.


55
00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.681 line:-2 align:center
Further, adoption can improve your app's
experience in two noticeable ways.


56
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,951 line:-2
First launch and new level load times
can become dramatically faster,


57
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:07,454 line:-2
potentially resulting in greater
engagement and interaction.


58
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,123 line:-2
Stutters or frame rate drops,
due to runtime compilation


59
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,592 line:-1
can be removed at last,


60
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:15,429 line:-2
without the memory
or CPU cost of pre-warming frames.


61
00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:18.465 line:-2 align:center
I'll explore these benefits
in more detail next.


62
00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.803 line:-2 align:center
Here you have your traditional
app runtime binary generation.


63
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,706 line:-2
In this example, your app spends
roughly 2/3 of its time


64
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,275 line:-2
compiling GPU binaries
behind a loading screen,


65
00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:31.011 line:-1 align:center
before you can begin interacting with it.


66
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:35,616 line:-2
But with offline compilation your runtime
shader generation moves to app build time,


67
00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.018 line:-2 align:center
PSO creation happens
in a fraction of the time,


68
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.187 line:-2 align:center
and you are able to interact
with your app sooner


69
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.890 line:-1 align:center
instead of idling away at a load screen.


70
00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:47.694 line:-2 align:center
Offline compilation
also helps to reduce stutters.


71
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,930 line:-2
With traditional
runtime binary generation,


72
00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:52.900 line:-2 align:center
you may have too many pipeline states
to create at load time,


73
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,470 line:-2
so you might instead be creating
some just-in-time.


74
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,139 line:-2
And when that happens,
you may experience frame drops


75
00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:02.476 line:-2 align:center
caused by compilation temporarily
interrupting your command encoding.


76
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,979 line:-2
Offline compilation
removes those pesky bubbles,


77
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:10,217 line:-2
because you can compile many more shaders
at app build time.


78
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,352 line:-2
Next, I will share
a new developer workflow


79
00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:15.389 line:-2 align:center
to help you harness the benefits
of offline compilation.


80
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,693 line:-2
In the following workflow you'll learn
how to use new toolchain features


81
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,962 line:-1
to build GPU binaries offline.


82
00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:25.732 line:-2 align:center
I'll show you how to generate
your new pipelines script input artifact.


83
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:29.703 line:-2 align:center
Then, how to invoke the toolchain
to generate a GPU binary.


84
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,940 line:-2
A pipelines script artifact is
a JSON formatted description


85
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,976 line:-2
of one or more API pipeline
state descriptors


86
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.145 line:-1 align:center
and can be generated in many ways.


87
00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:41.181 line:-2 align:center
For example,
author them in your favorite JSON editor,


88
00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:46.520 line:-2 align:center
or Harvest them from binary archives
serialized during development and testing.


89
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:50,324 line:-2
Here you have a snippet of Metal code that
generates a render pipeline descriptor


90
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:54,528 line:-2
with state and functions
and its equivalent JSON representation.


91
00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:59.633 line:-2 align:center
First, your API metal library file
is specified as a libraries path property.


92
00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:04.471 line:-2 align:center
Then your API render descriptor function
names as render pipelines properties.


93
00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:07.241 line:-2 align:center
Lastly, other pipeline state,
like raster_sample_count


94
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:11,111 line:-2
or pixel formats,
are also captured as script properties.


95
00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:15.082 line:-2 align:center
Look for further JSON schema details
in Metal's developer documentation.


96
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,753 line:-2
You also may want to kickstart
JSON script generation,


97
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,289 line:-1
and using the Metal runtime can help.


98
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,525 line:-2
Simply generate
your binary archives at runtime,


99
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,728 line:-2
and serialize them during your development
and testing process.


100
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:31,098 line:-2
Now I'll show you how you can accomplish
this with the Metal API.


101
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,968 line:-1
You begin the runtime harvesting process


102
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,939 line:-2
by creating your pipeline descriptor
with state and functions,


103
00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:43.076 line:-2 align:center
adding it to an archive,
which generates GPU binary,


104
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,779 line:-2
and serializing it
to the file system to import into


105
00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.981 line:-1 align:center
and load from your app's bundle.


106
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:52,419 line:-2
The Metal 3 runtime stores your pipeline
descriptor alongside the GPU binary.


107
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,622 line:-1
Now I'll show you how to extract them.


108
00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:58.292 line:-2 align:center
metal-source allows you
to extract your JSON pipelines script


109
00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:00.494 line:-1 align:center
from an existing archive.


110
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:05.599 line:-2 align:center
This is handy for migrating your binary
generation from runtime to app build time.


111
00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:07.801 line:-2 align:center
Just invoke metal-source
with the flatbuffers


112
00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:10.137 line:-1 align:center
and output directory options.


113
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.805 line:-1 align:center
The result is a pipelines script file,


114
00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.942 line:-2 align:center
which you can edit
to generate additional binaries.


115
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:18,912 line:-2
Now, I'll show you
how to invoke the toolchain.


116
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:22,983 line:-2
Generating a GPU binary from
an Xcode project build phase is easy.


117
00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:26.553 line:-2 align:center
Simply invoke metal as you would
from the terminal with your source,


118
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,523 line:-1
pipelines script, and output file.


119
00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:32.326 line:-2 align:center
Your output metal library
now contains GPU binary,


120
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:36,330 line:-2
and can be deployed across
any toolchain supported device.


121
00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:38.866 line:-2 align:center
And if instead of source,
you have a Metal library,


122
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,569 line:-1
you can pass that to the toolchain too.


123
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,072 line:-2
Generating a binary from
a pre-existing Metal library


124
00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:48.141 line:-2 align:center
is just as easy
with Metal translator tool.


125
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,512 line:-2
Just call metal-tt as you would
in a terminal with your source,


126
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,947 line:-1
pipelines script, and output file.


127
00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:56.550 line:-2 align:center
Your resulting Metal library
now contains GPU binary


128
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,787 line:-1
for all toolchain supported devices.


129
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,056 line:-2
Now that you know
how to create binaries offline,


130
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,459 line:-1
I'll review how to load them.


131
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:09,162 line:-2
Simply provide the binary URL
when creating an archive descriptor


132
00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:10.964 line:-1 align:center
and use it to instantiate an archive.


133
00:07:10.998 --> 00:07:12.299 line:-1 align:center
That's it!


134
00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:14.935 line:-2 align:center
For more information about
Metal's binary archive API,


135
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,071 line:0
please refer to our previous years' talks.


136
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,275 align:center
Finally, a note on how Metal handles
GPU binary compatibility


137
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:25,145 align:center
for offline generated artifacts.


138
00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:27.681 line:-2 align:center
To ensure your offline generated binaries
are forward compatible


139
00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:30.317 line:-1 align:center
with future OS versions and products.


140
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,420 line:-2
Metal gracefully upgrades
your binary archives during OS updates


141
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.688 line:-1 align:center
or at app install time.


142
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:38,392 line:-2
It does so asynchronously,
and in the background.


143
00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:41.495 line:-2 align:center
I can't wait for you to harness
the benefits of offline compilation


144
00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:45.632 line:-2 align:center
to remove runtime stutters and reduce
first launch and new level load times.


145
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,701 line:-2
Such improvements can be tangible
to others


146
00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:49.837 line:-1 align:center
and enhance their overall app experience.


147
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.538 line:-1 align:center
Now, over to Eylon.


148
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,507 line:-1
Eylon: Thanks, Galo.


149
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,976 line:-2
Next, I'll introduce
the new compile option,


150
00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:58.278 line:-1 align:center
optimize for size.


151
00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:02.549 line:-2 align:center
The Metal compiler optimizes code
aggressively for runtime performance.


152
00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:05.919 line:-2 align:center
Some optimizations
expand the GPU program size,


153
00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:09.223 line:-1 align:center
which may introduce unexpected costs.


154
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,292 line:-2
For example,
function inlining is an optimization


155
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,828 line:-1
to avoid the overhead of a function call.


156
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:19,099 line:-2
It works by inlining the body
of the called function into the call site.


157
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:22,035 line:-2
This example kernel
doesn't look like a lot of code,


158
00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:23.670 line:-1 align:center
but after inlining,


159
00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:26.206 line:-2 align:center
it would contain a copy
of functions 'f' and 'g',


160
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,176 line:-2
and potentially also of functions
called from 'f' and 'g',


161
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,412 line:-2
such as helpers
and non-primitive library functions.


162
00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:36.817 line:-1 align:center
Another optimization is loop unrolling,


163
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,052 line:-2
which inlines additional copies
of a loop body,


164
00:08:39.086 --> 00:08:41.388 line:-1 align:center
to expose parallelism across iterations


165
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:44.591 line:-1 align:center
and to avoid branching overhead.


166
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:48,562 line:-2
The compiler may unroll as few
as two iterations of the loop


167
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:53,734 line:-2
or as many as all the iterations of a loop
that has fixed bounds.


168
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,937 line:-2
When optimizations like these
create a very large program,


169
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,073 line:-2
the compiler also has to spend
a lot more time compiling it,


170
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:04,511 line:-2
and in some situations,
you may prefer to avoid those costs.


171
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:10,684 line:-2
Xcode 14 introduces a new Metal
optimization mode: optimize for size.


172
00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.287 line:-2 align:center
This mode limits size-expanding
transformations,


173
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,389 line:-1
such as inlining and loop unrolling,


174
00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:18.592 line:-2 align:center
when the compiler applies
performance optimizations.


175
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,895 line:-2
The intended benefit
is to keep the GPU binary smaller,


176
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:25,399 line:-2
and the compile time shorter,
in cases when default optimization


177
00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:27.534 line:-1 align:center
proves to be too expensive.


178
00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.203 line:-1 align:center
When optimizing for size,


179
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,606 line:-2
it is possible for the result
to have lower runtime performance.


180
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,275 line:-2
Whether that actually happens
depends on the program,


181
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:39,713 line:-2
so you will need to try both
optimization modes and compare.


182
00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:43.650 line:-2 align:center
Optimize for size may not improve size
and compile time for all shaders.


183
00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:46.553 line:-2 align:center
It is most likely to have benefit
for large programs


184
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,488 line:-1
with deep call paths and loops,


185
00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:50.958 line:-1 align:center
where inlining and unrolling are common.


186
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,926 line:-2
The option is worth trying
whenever you encounter


187
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,064 line:-2
an unexpectedly long compile time
from default optimization.


188
00:09:57.097 --> 00:10:02.236 line:-2 align:center
The option is available whether compiling
at project build time or at app runtime.


189
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:06.206 line:-2 align:center
Here's a case where optimize for size
can make a difference.


190
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,843 line:-2
Cycles is a an open source project
implementing a production renderer


191
00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:12.112 line:-1 align:center
for the Blender 3D design environment,


192
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,148 line:-1
and was recently updated to support Metal.


193
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,918 line:-2
Apple recently joined
the Blender Development Fund,


194
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,688 line:-2
and one of the things we learned
was that Blender's path tracing algorithms


195
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:25,425 line:-2
use large compute shaders,
with many helper functions and loops,


196
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,328 line:-2
and its compile times
can add up to minutes.


197
00:10:28.362 --> 00:10:31.365 line:-2 align:center
It turns out those are exactly
the kind of shaders that can benefit


198
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,334 line:-2
from Metal 3's
new optimize for size option.


199
00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:39.439 line:-2 align:center
When rendering these scenes
on an Apple Silicon GPU,


200
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,776 line:-2
enabling optimize for size
improved Blender's Setup Time,


201
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:48,215 line:-2
which includes compiling shader pipelines,
by up to 1.4x.


202
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:52,953 line:-2
And it provided that speedup with
little or no degradation in Render Time.


203
00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:55.022 line:-1 align:center
Some renders slowed up to 4%,


204
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,457 line:-1
and some did not slow at all.


205
00:10:57.491 --> 00:11:00.227 line:-1 align:center
So lower runtime performance is possible.


206
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.531 line:-2 align:center
But in some cases, optimize for size
can also improve runtime performance.


207
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:07,334 line:-1
Here's an example.


208
00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:10.204 line:-2 align:center
These are Render Time speedups
for the same scenes


209
00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:14.174 line:-2 align:center
from enabling optimize for size
on Intel GPUs.


210
00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:16.610 line:-1 align:center
The benefit was not just faster compiles,


211
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:20,480 line:-2
but also some faster renders,
by up to 1.6x.


212
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,481 line:-1
How?


213
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:25,018 line:-2
Because a smaller GPU program
can avoid some of the runtime penalties


214
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,620 line:-1
that come with large size:


215
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,922 line:-2
it may enjoy
fewer instruction cache misses,


216
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:30,757 line:-1
or need fewer registers,


217
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,659 line:-1
which translates to fewer spills to memory


218
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,295 line:-1
or even more threads in parallel.


219
00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:38.932 line:-2 align:center
Keep in mind, these results
are not typical of all shaders and scenes,


220
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,868 line:-1
and a performance drop is possible.


221
00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:44.104 line:-2 align:center
For your project, you will need
to evaluate the actual impact


222
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,107 line:-2
to both compile time
and runtime performance.


223
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,677 line:-2
You can enable optimize for size
when compiling from Metal source,


224
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,046 line:-1
in three different environments.


225
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,349 line:-1
In the Xcode 14 user interface,


226
00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:58.352 line:-2 align:center
specify optimize for size
as a build setting.


227
00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.888 line:-1 align:center
Under "Metal Compiler - Build Options"


228
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,290 line:-1
find the setting "Optimization Level".


229
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:07,528 line:-2
Level "Default" optimizes for performance,
as Metal has done in the past.


230
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:10.397 line:-1 align:center
Level "Size" enables optimize for size.


231
00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:14.268 line:-2 align:center
When compiling Metal source
by command line,


232
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:18,238 line:-2
specify optimize for size
using option'-Os'.


233
00:12:18.272 --> 00:12:23.343 line:-2 align:center
The first example specifies the option
to a single compile-and-link command.


234
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:25,946 line:-2
The second example
has two compile commands


235
00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:28.115 line:-2 align:center
and specifies the option
to just one of them


236
00:12:28.148 --> 00:12:30.551 line:-1 align:center
to enable it for only some shaders.


237
00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:32.920 line:-2 align:center
The option does not need to be passed
to the link command


238
00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:34.721 line:-1 align:center
or to any subsequent commands.


239
00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:38.125 line:-2 align:center
And you can use optimize for size
either with, or without,


240
00:12:38.158 --> 00:12:42.529 line:-2 align:center
generating a GPU binary using the commands
presented earlier in this talk.


241
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:49,069 line:-2
Finally, when compiling Metal source
at app runtime with a Metal Framework API


242
00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:51.138 line:-1 align:center
such as 'newLibraryWithSource',


243
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:54,942 line:-2
specify optimize for size
in a 'MTLCompileOptions' object


244
00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:57.811 line:-1 align:center
using property 'optimizationLevel'.


245
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:02,316 line:-2
The optimization level
may be 'default' or 'size'.


246
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,719 line:-2
I hope your project will benefit
from this new optimization mode


247
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,988 line:-1
in the Metal compiler.


248
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:10.657 line:-2 align:center
Galo: To wrap up,
I presented offline compilation,


249
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:14,328 line:-2
a new workflow for generating GPU binaries
entirely at app build time,


250
00:13:14.361 --> 00:13:18.298 line:-2 align:center
to reduce in-app stutters,
first launch, and new level load times.


251
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:20,934 line:-1
Eylon: Then I presented optimize for size,


252
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,871 line:-2
a new Metal optimization mode
when compiling from source,


253
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:27,541 line:-1
to reduce program size and compile time.


254
00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:29.710 line:-2 align:center
Galo: We hope these improvements
help your app or game


255
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,578 line:-1
deliver an improved user experience.


256
00:13:31.612 --> 00:13:34.648 line:-2 align:center
Eylon: With shorter setup and load times,
fewer stutters,


257
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:39,253 line:-2
and new workflows,
thanks to lower compile costs at runtime.
