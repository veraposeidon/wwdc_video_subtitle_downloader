Mahesh Molakalapalli:
My name is Mahesh Molakalapalli.


4
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:16,083 line:-2
I am an engineering manager on
the App Store and App Analytics team.


5
00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:20.020 line:-2 align:center
Our goal with App Analytics
is to help you grow your business


6
00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:24.024 line:-2 align:center
by providing you with the unique
insights about your app.


7
00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:28.629 line:-2 align:center
Today, I am going to introduce you
to an exciting new feature


8
00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:31.098 line:-1 align:center
called App Benchmarking


9
00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:35.636 line:-2 align:center
that will help you get better insights
than ever before.


10
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:39,706 line:-2
We will begin with an overview
of benchmarking.


11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:45,779 line:-2
Then we'll talk about the metrics for
which you can see benchmarking data.


12
00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:50.684 line:-2 align:center
Next, we'll show you how we create
relevant benchmarks


13
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:55,155 line:-1
while protecting the privacy of all apps.


14
00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.526 line:-2 align:center
And we will wrap up by showing you
how you can take action


15
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.530 line:-1 align:center
on insights gained from benchmarking.


16
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,132 line:-1
Let's get started.


17
00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.868 line:-1 align:center
Many of you may already use App Analytics.


18
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,537 line:-1
In this tool, we share data with you


19
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:15.409 line:-2 align:center
about your app's acquisition,
usage, and monetization.


20
00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:19.546 line:-2 align:center
Let's say that you are a developer
of an app called Mountain Climber,


21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,650 line:-2
which is a travel app
offering subscriptions.


22
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:28,655 line:-2
The overview page shows how
Mountain Climber is performing over time,


23
00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.558 line:-1 align:center
across key performance metrics


24
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:36,864 line:-2
that allows you to monitor results
in each stage of the customer lifecycle,


25
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:42,236 line:-2
from awareness
to conversion and on to retention.


26
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:44.771 line:-1 align:center
Since you're focused on growth,


27
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:49,643 line:-2
let's say that one of your top
business priorities for your app


28
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,479 line:-1
has been to improve your conversion rate.


29
00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:56.483 line:-2 align:center
Looking at the data,
you have been making steady improvement,


30
00:01:56,517 --> 00:02:00,888 line:-2
with a 5.5% increase
over the last 90 days.


31
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:04.758 line:-2 align:center
But what is unclear
is how much more improvement


32
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.262 line:-2 align:center
you might be able to achieve
with continued effort.


33
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,664 line:-1
Do you have more opportunity to grow,


34
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:14,535 line:-2
or should you focus your efforts
somewhere else?


35
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,838 line:-2
That's where peer group benchmarking
comes in.


36
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:20.607 line:-2 align:center
You can learn
about the performance of apps


37
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.144 line:-2 align:center
that are similar to your app
in a privacy-friendly way,


38
00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:28.415 line:-2 align:center
and check how you are performing
relative to them.


39
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,584 line:-1
Like your Mountain Climber app,


40
00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:34.621 line:-2 align:center
all the apps
on the right hand side are travel apps,


41
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,724 line:-1
with a subscription business model.


42
00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:42.963 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a look at how your App is doing
compared to this group.


43
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:48,836 align:center
You can see the same apps,
arranged left to right,


44
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:52,673 line:0
from lowest to highest conversion rates.


45
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:56,610 line:0
So how does your app stack up
against all the others?


46
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,347 line:0
Although your conversion rate
has been improving over time,


47
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,784 line:0
you are still in the bottom half
of your peer group.


48
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,119 align:center
There's plenty of room for improvement.


49
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,989 align:center
Benchmarking provides insights like this


50
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:14,728 align:center
without revealing the performance
of any individual app in your peer group.


51
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:20,501 line:0
We do this by including enough apps
to provide meaningful results


52
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,869 align:center
in the aggregate


53
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:26,373 line:0
so that it doesn't reveal
any individual app's performance.


54
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,543 line:0
And in order to show
your relative position,


55
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:34,381 align:center
we show you what the distribution
of your peer group looks like


56
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:40,053 line:0
such as the 25th, 50th,
and 75th percentiles of your group.


57
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,324 line:0
You will then be able to see
how you are performing


58
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,293 align:center
relative to your peer group,


59
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,363 align:center
and understand
whether you have growth opportunity,


60
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,900 line:0
or whether
you're already beating the competition.


61
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:57,437 line:-2
Now that you have an idea
of what peer group benchmarking is


62
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,640 line:-1
and why it is so important,


63
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:04,611 line:-2
let us talk about the metrics that you
will be able to use in this feature.


64
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:09,449 line:-2
One of our goals with benchmarking
is to give you insight


65
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:14,288 line:-2
into how your app is performing
throughout the customer lifecycle.


66
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:20.160 line:-2 align:center
That's why we will be offering benchmarks
for metrics related to acquisition,


67
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,963 line:-1
usage, and monetization.


68
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,699 line:-2
To help you measure
your acquisition efforts,


69
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,036 line:-2
we will provide you with
conversion rate benchmarks.


70
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:33,440 line:-2
Conversion rate helps you understand
how often people download


71
00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:37.978 line:-2 align:center
or redownload your app
after seeing it on the App Store.


72
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,847 line:-1
The higher your conversion rate,


73
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,617 line:-2
the more efficiently
you are acquiring your customers.


74
00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:49.089 line:-2 align:center
To help you measure usage,
you will be able to see Day 1,


75
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.359 line:-1 align:center
Day 7, and Day 28 retention.


76
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:56,129 line:-2
Retention helps you understand
what percentage of people return


77
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,699 line:-1
to your app one day after download,


78
00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:00.133 line:-1 align:center
seven days after download,


79
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,369 line:-1
and 28 days after download,


80
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:06,807 line:-2
and is a good indicator
of how engaging your app is


81
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,408 line:-1
for your customers.


82
00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.747 line:-2 align:center
You will also be able to see
how your crash rate stacks up


83
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,682 line:-1
against your peers.


84
00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:19.186 line:-2 align:center
If your app is prone to crashing
more often than normal,


85
00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:23.390 line:-2 align:center
it may negatively impact your engagement
and monetization metrics,


86
00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:26.627 line:-2 align:center
so it's good to keep this
as low as possible.


87
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:32,032 line:-2
Finally, to help you evaluate
your monetization strategy,


88
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:37,471 line:-2
you will be able to see benchmarks
around average proceeds per paying user.


89
00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:42.075 line:-2 align:center
This will allow you to see how much money
your peers take home


90
00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:44.444 line:-1 align:center
from each of their paying customers,


91
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,314 line:-1
so you can see how you compare.


92
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,385 line:-2
Now that you know what metrics
you will be able to see,


93
00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:55.222 line:-1 align:center
let us talk about relevancy and privacy.


94
00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:57.424 line:-2 align:center
Throughout the development
of this feature,


95
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,260 line:-1
we have strived to create peer groups


96
00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:03.463 line:-2 align:center
that are highly relevant to you
and your business,


97
00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:08.802 line:-2 align:center
while also protecting the privacy
of each app within that group.


98
00:06:08.836 --> 00:06:14.141 line:-2 align:center
This helps us meet our goals
of providing you with helpful insights,


99
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:18,478 line:-2
without revealing the performance
of any individual app.


100
00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:20.881 line:-1 align:center
Let us discuss two examples


101
00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:24.585 line:-2 align:center
of how we will make the peer groups
relevant to you,


102
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:29,289 line:-2
no matter what kind of app
that you have on the App Store.


103
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:34,094 line:-2
First, we will use a number of attributes
that we have on the App Store


104
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,096 line:-1
to create your peer groups,


105
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,199 line:-1
including the app's App Store category.


106
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:43.003 line:-2 align:center
For example, if you have put your app
in the travel category,


107
00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.938 line:-1 align:center
we will group you with other apps


108
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:48,509 line:-2
that also put themselves
in the travel category.


109
00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:53.547 line:-2 align:center
Second, we will also look at
how your app monetizes on the store.


110
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.350 line:-1 align:center
For example, is it a free app,


111
00:06:56,383 --> 00:07:00,320 line:-2
freemium, paid,
paidmium, or subscription?


112
00:07:00.354 --> 00:07:04.024 line:-2 align:center
Since apps with different business models
have different expectations


113
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,759 line:-1
about user behavior,


114
00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:10.564 line:-2 align:center
this is also a very important factor
for creating relevant peer groups.


115
00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:14.468 line:-2 align:center
Each attribute that we use to create
your peer groups


116
00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:19.173 line:-2 align:center
has been tested to ensure
it allows for meaningful comparisons


117
00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:23.143 line:-2 align:center
over time between your app
and its peer group.


118
00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:25.546 line:-1 align:center
Next, let's talk about privacy.


119
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:30,217 line:-2
At Apple, we have significant experience
with building great products


120
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,286 line:-1
that also have great privacy,


121
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,023 line:-1
and we used that experience here.


122
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,192 line:0
In order to accomplish our privacy goals,


123
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,361 align:center
we use a technique called
differential privacy,


124
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:44,932 align:center
which is the gold standard
for ensuring that aggregated data


125
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:50,037 line:0
can remain both helpful
and private at the same time.


126
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,074 line:0
When we calculate your peer
group's overall conversion rate,


127
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,643 line:0
we add small amounts of noise


128
00:07:56,677 --> 00:08:01,181 line:0
to each data point
we share about your peer group.


129
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:05,485 line:0
We also ensure
that enough apps are in your peer group


130
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,522 line:0
so that it is not possible to know


131
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:13,427 align:center
whether a particular app is in
or out of your peer group,


132
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,597 line:0
because the noise added to the data set


133
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,201 line:0
is large enough to obscure
the exact makeup of the peer group,


134
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:24,238 align:center
while still providing useful information


135
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:27,074 line:0
about your peer group in the aggregate.


136
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:30,043 line:0
This protects the privacy of your app


137
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:33,046 line:0
and all the other apps in the peer group.


138
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,751 line:-2
Let us end by taking a look at
how you can use other tools


139
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,153 line:-1
to take action on this information.


140
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,725 line:-2
The App Store provides a number
of developer features


141
00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:49.530 line:-2 align:center
that enable you to optimize
and improve your performance


142
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,332 line:-1
across the customer lifecycle.


143
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,569 line:-2
For example,
to have a great conversion rate,


144
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,639 line:-2
you need to have
a great App Store product page,


145
00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:02.409 line:-2 align:center
and the App Store offers you
tools to help.


146
00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:04.611 line:-1 align:center
With product page optimization,


147
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,314 line:-1
you can test different app icons,


148
00:09:07.347 --> 00:09:09.683 line:-1 align:center
screenshots, and app previews


149
00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:15.689 line:-2 align:center
to find out which combination of features
works best with your customers.


150
00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:19.960 line:-2 align:center
And with custom product pages,
you can create unique product pages


151
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,562 line:-1
for different audience


152
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,097 line:-1
that focus on their specific interests,


153
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:28,235 line:-2
rather than having one product page
for all customers.


154
00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:33.807 line:-2 align:center
Both of these features can help you
boost your conversion rate.


155
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,410 line:-1
In order to improve your usage metrics,


156
00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:39.947 line:-2 align:center
you can utilize in-app events
and App Clips.


157
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,984 line:-2
In-app events are timely events
within apps and gamesâ€“


158
00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:46.019 line:-1 align:center
such as game competitions,


159
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:49,456 line:-2
movie premieres,
or livestreamed experiencesâ€“


160
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,992 line:-1
that you can showcase on the App Store


161
00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:56.730 line:-2 align:center
to engage new customers
and re-engage existing customers.


162
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,933 line:-2
And an App Clip is
a small part of your app


163
00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:03.403 line:-2 align:center
that is discoverable
in relevant public places


164
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:07,441 line:-2
so your customers can complete
a quick task from your app.


165
00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:10.944 line:-2 align:center
For example, whether ordering take-out
from a restaurant,


166
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:14,214 line:-2
renting a scooter,
or setting up a new connected appliance


167
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:17,251 line:-2
for the first time,
people can launch the App Clip


168
00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:20.854 line:-1 align:center
to easily start and finish the task.

so that users can customize
their experiences


172
00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:34.067 line:-2 align:center
based on their preferences
and the amount they want to pay.


173
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:37,271 line:-2
Or you can create
a promoted in-app purchase,


174
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,975 line:-2
which lets users browse the items for sale
directly on the App Store,


175
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,078 line:-1
even before they download your app.


176
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:48,715 line:0

Peer Group Benchmarking
is an exciting tool


183
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,874 line:-2
that will let you compare
your App Store performance


184
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:18,245 line:-2
against a group of similar apps
on the store.


185
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,814 line:-1
We have designed Peer Group Benchmarking


186
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:25,052 line:-2
using differential privacy
to provide relevant insights


187
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:30,157 line:-2
without revealing the information
about any individual app.


188
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.292 line:-1 align:center
By using Peer Group Benchmarking


189
00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:36.263 line:-2 align:center
in combination with other developer
features on the App Store,


190
00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:42.369 line:-2 align:center
you will have the ability to boost
your app's performance on the App Store.


191
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:47,007 line:-2
You will be able to start using
Peer Group Benchmarking early next year.


192
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.942 line:-1 align:center
