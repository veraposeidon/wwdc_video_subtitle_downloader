00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,812 line:-1
Hi, my name is Thalia,


4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,749 line:-2
and today we will learn what's new
in SF Symbols.


5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:20,120 line:-2
A symbol is one of the most effective
single pieces of graphic communication.


6
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,390 line:-2
If you ever want to represent a feeling,
an object,


7
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:27,694 line:-2
an action, or a concept,
symbols are an excellent way to do so.


8
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,564 line:-2
Symbols are used frequently
and consistently,


9
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,633 line:-1
becoming second nature to us.


10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,435 line:-2
Without relying on them,
we will find it very difficult


11
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,171 line:-1
to navigate our surroundings.


12
00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:41.441 line:-2 align:center
As a result, they become
an essential part of interface design,


13
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:45,846 line:-2
as symbols are an excellent way
to aid in communication.


14
00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.684 line:-2 align:center
A symbol can also bring many benefits
by being a means of interaction,


15
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,854 line:-1
being space-efficient,


16
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,590 line:-1
enhancing the aesthetic appeal,


17
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:00,294 line:-1
and engaging us by being user-friendly.


18
00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:04.965 line:-2 align:center
What is so great about a symbol
is that it can transcend many languages.


19
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,733 line:-1
They can be universal.


20
00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:11.505 line:-2 align:center
As a result, symbols can unite people
in communicating shared ideas,


21
00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:16.777 line:-2 align:center
helping engage with others on a deeper
level than is possible with just words.


22
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,681 line:-2
At Apple, we care deeply
about making the user interface


23
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,816 line:-1
and the overall experience better.


24
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,118 line:-1
That's why we created SF Symbols,


25
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,721 line:-1
an extensive library of iconography


26
00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:32.292 line:-2 align:center
designed to integrate seamlessly
with San Francisco, the system font,


27
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:35,796 line:-2
providing a powerful
and flexible design resource


28
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,867 line:-2
for creating experiences
on all Apple platforms.


29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,836 line:-2
SF Symbols is designed
with typography in mind.


30
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.307 line:-2 align:center
It has awesome features
like different weights, scales,


31
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:51.879 line:-2 align:center
outlined and filled variants,
encapsulated shapes, and alignments.


32
00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:55.682 line:-2 align:center
To learn more about these features
and when it's best to use them,


33
00:01:55.716 --> 00:02:00.687 line:-2 align:center
check out last year's video
from WWDC to get you up to speed.


34
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:04.091 line:-2 align:center
Today, we will take a look
at the new repertoire


35
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,261 line:-1
and the new categories in "New symbols."


36
00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:11.732 line:-2 align:center
In "Rendering modes," we will review
the benefits of adding colors to symbols,


37
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:17,471 line:-2
and we have a new configuration to
help make the symbol's behavior automatic.


38
00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:20.874 line:-2 align:center
We have a new exciting feature
called "Variable Color."


39
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:25,579 line:-2
Here we will explore the use of color
to make a symbol more dynamic.


40
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:30,150 line:-2
And finally, we have a more efficient way
of annotating symbols.


41
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:33,687 line:-2
We will learn more about it
in "Unified annotations."


42
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,489 line:-1
So let's get started.


43
00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:38.659 line:-2 align:center
The SF Symbols library
keeps growing each year,


44
00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:42.129 line:-2 align:center
with newer categories
and symbols to choose from.


45
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.331 line:-1 align:center
There are some great additions for Home,


46
00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:48.869 line:-2 align:center
including lights, blinds,
windows, and doors.


47
00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:52.806 line:-2 align:center
We even have light switches
and power outlets.


48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,609 line:-1
There are new furniture and appliances.


49
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,978 line:-1
And new health symbols.


50
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,783 line:-2
And this year, our fitness figures
are available for you to use.


51
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:06,153 line:-2
We have expanded
the library's currency symbols.


52
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:09.756 line:-2 align:center
And we have many new objects
to choose from.


53
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.126 line:-2 align:center
And, of course,
we keep expanding our localized symbols,


54
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.699 line:-2 align:center
with new ones covering different scripts
and right-to-left writing systems.


55
00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:21.835 line:-2 align:center
There are over 700 new symbols
to choose from,


56
00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:27.040 line:-2 align:center
making SF Symbols a library
of more than 4,000 unique symbols.


57
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,876 line:-1
That is amazing.


58
00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.513 line:-2 align:center
With all these new additions,
we wanted to help you navigate


59
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,982 line:-2
through all the symbols
in the SF Symbols app,


60
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:39,486 line:-2
so we've added five new categories
that we think will be super helpful:


61
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,989 line:-1
Camera & Photos,


62
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,957 line:-1
Accessibility,


63
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,026 line:-1
Privacy & Security,


64
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,496 line:-1
Home, and Fitness.


65
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,367 line:-2
And remember that in the app,
you can always create your own collection


66
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,638 line:-2
with a selection of symbols
that best suits your needs.


67
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:02,075 line:-2
Now, let's have a quick reminder
about the different rendering modes.


68
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,778 line:-1
As you may know, in SF Symbols,


69
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.047 line:-2 align:center
there are four rendering modes
to choose from,


70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,519 line:-2
each one providing a greater control
over how color is applied to a symbol.


71
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:16,323 line:-2
Monochrome is the most neutral
of all the rendering modes.


72
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,825 line:-1
It gives a uniform and consistent look,


73
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,428 line:-2
and it is the rendering mode
that most closely reflects


74
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,965 line:-1
the typographic nature of SF Symbols.


75
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,936 line:-2
Hierarchical is the rendering mode
that provides a subtle emphasis


76
00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.606 line:-2 align:center
while having a single color hue
drive the overall aesthetic.


77
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.177 line:-2 align:center
We can apply depth by highlighting
the most important shape of a symbol


78
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:40.981 line:-2 align:center
or differentiate the foreground
and background elements.


79
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,618 line:-2
That way, we create a visual hierarchy
by emphasizing


80
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:48.589 line:-1 align:center
the essential part or parts of a symbol.


81
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,893 line:-2
Palette uses two or more contrasting
colors to give elements of a symbol


82
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,895 line:-1
more prominence and versatility,


83
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,598 line:-1
allowing for the symbols to be customized


84
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,468 line:-2
to integrate with the color palette
of the environment.


85
00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:05.172 line:-2 align:center
Palette helps the symbols
have a contrasting and unique look


86
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:08,809 line:-1
without sacrificing the overall aesthetic.


87
00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:12.779 line:-2 align:center
And Multicolor is the rendering mode
that represents the intrinsic


88
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,249 line:-1
or native color of a symbol.


89
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:19,753 line:-2
This rendering mode uses a range of colors
that can be applied to a symbol


90
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,390 line:-2
to describe the appearance of an object
in the physical world,


91
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,692 line:-2
or it can use colors
to emphasize the meaning


92
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,061 line:-1
that the symbol is trying to convey.


93
00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:32.432 line:-2 align:center
You can use Multicolor when
the symbols are very prominent in the UI,


94
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:38,038 line:-2
as it will help create a color narrative
that will relate to the symbol forms.


95
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:42,376 line:-2
Until now, if you didn't explicitly
specify a rendering mode,


96
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.478 line:-1 align:center
you would get Monochrome by default.


97
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.514 line:-2 align:center
But this year,
we've made it easier to display symbols


98
00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:52.419 line:-2 align:center
in a rendering mode that best highlights
each symbol's unique characteristics.


99
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,888 line:-2
Symbols now feature
a preferred rendering mode,


100
00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:57.624 line:-1 align:center
which can vary between symbols.


101
00:05:57.658 --> 00:06:01.495 line:-2 align:center
And we call this behavior
Automatic Rendering.


102
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:05.432 line:-2 align:center
When selected, it provides
the preferred rendering mode configuration


103
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,903 line:-2
for each symbol
without having to specify it manually.


104
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,639 line:-1
For example, when Automatic is selected,


105
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:16,143 line:-2
the camera filters symbol
will opt into Hierarchical,


106
00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:20.514 line:-2 align:center
as it is the rendering mode that conveys
a more precise visual representation


107
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,917 line:-2
by highlighting the opacities
that reference the translucency


108
00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:27.654 line:-1 align:center
of the physical camera lenses and filters.


109
00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:29.590 line:-1 align:center
Here's another example.


110
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,692 line:-1
When Automatic is selected,


111
00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:36.263 line:-2 align:center
the SharePlay symbol participates
in the Hierarchical rendering mode.


112
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:41,068 line:-2
This behavior lets the person's shape
stand prominently in the foreground


113
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,838 line:-2
while the waves play a secondary role
in the background.


114
00:06:44.872 --> 00:06:48.108 line:-2 align:center
Again,
this emphasizes the symbol's concept,


115
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,944 line:-2
as the SharePlay feature
is mainly a way to share


116
00:06:50.978 --> 00:06:53.981 line:-1 align:center
and connect with friends and family.


117
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,918 line:-2
In most cases,
Automatic will be the best way to go.


118
00:06:57.951 --> 00:07:00.587 line:-2 align:center
But you always have to be aware
of the context.


119
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:05.526 line:-2 align:center
For example, the AirPods Pro symbol
will render as Hierarchical


120
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,561 line:-1
when Automatic is selected.


121
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,731 line:-2
But in this context,
the symbol is very small


122
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:15,502 line:-2
and has low contrast
when presented on this background.


123
00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:19.606 line:-2 align:center
Remember that rendering modes
can still be explicitly specified


124
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.678 line:-2 align:center
for a uniform appearance
across symbols in a particular context.


125
00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:28.215 line:-2 align:center
So in this case,
Monochrome will be the best choice


126
00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:33.053 line:-2 align:center
as it is more legible
and has fewer details at small sizes.


127
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:38,959 line:-2
So always make sure to specify the most
suitable rendering mode configuration.


128
00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:42.529 line:-2 align:center
The different rendering modes
apply color to symbols


129
00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:46.900 line:-2 align:center
to present visual solutions
for a wide range of circumstances.


130
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:51,438 line:-2
Color is a powerful tool,
and we can explore it even further.


131
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.141 line:-1 align:center
Some symbols are more dynamic in nature.


132
00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:56.910 line:-1 align:center
If we analyze their visual representation,


133
00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:59.780 line:-1 align:center
we can notice two main characteristics:


134
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:05.385 line:-2 align:center
first, their paths or shapes convey
varying levels of strength,


135
00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:08.422 line:-2 align:center
and second,
they rely on color to communicate


136
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,625 line:-1
their status changing over time.


137
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,361 line:-2
This year,
we're expanding the use of color


138
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:18,432 line:-2
by introducing a new feature
called Variable Color.


139
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:22,202 line:-2
We've arranged the symbol's vector paths
into layers


140
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,606 line:-2
and organized those layers
in sequential order,


141
00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:29.576 line:-2 align:center
creating a new method of
distributing color through these layers.


142
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,579 line:-2
This allows us
to convey different levels of strength


143
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,882 line:-1
or communicate a sequence over time,


144
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:38,952 line:-2
which is dictated by the nature
of the design of the symbol.


145
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:42,256 line:-2
One important thing to know is that,
in Variable Color,


146
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,159 line:-2
some symbols have all paths
participating in the sequence,


147
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:51,565 line:-2
but for other symbols,
only some of the paths may opt-in.


148
00:08:51.598 --> 00:08:54.601 line:-1 align:center
Let's look at a few examples.


149
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:58,772 line:-2
With Variable Color,
we want the paths representing the iPhone


150
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,408 line:-1
to opt-out of the variable sequence,


151
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:05,445 line:-2
and we want to highlight the paths
representing the radio waves.


152
00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:09.917 line:-2 align:center
This will help differentiate the stages
that describe the levels of strength


153
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.920 line:-1 align:center
of the radio signal of the phone.


154
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,924 line:-2
It's important to know that we define
how we want to group the paths.


155
00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:19.359 line:-2 align:center
For example,
it wouldn't make much sense


156
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:23,030 line:-2
to highlight the waves
from left to right in this case.


157
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,767 line:-2
So instead, we can group the paths
following the sequence


158
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,170 line:-2
that best conveys
the radio signal strength:


159
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:33,440 line:-2
we have the two smaller waves
in one layer,


160
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,743 line:-2
and we have the two bigger waves
in a different layer.


161
00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:41.915 line:-2 align:center
And as mentioned, the phone does
not participate in the variable sequence.


162
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:46,486 line:-2
This time, let's look at a symbol
that we are very familiar with.


163
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.691 line:-2 align:center
In most cases, this symbol is paired
with a built-in slider


164
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:54,695 line:-2
that syncs with the states
represented in the symbol.


165
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,631 line:-2
The waves highlight their paths
following a sequence


166
00:09:57.664 --> 00:10:00.434 line:-2 align:center
dictated by the user
controlling the slider,


167
00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:04.505 line:-1 align:center
increasing or decreasing the volume level.


168
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,340 line:-1
Like in the iPhone example,


169
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,710 line:-2
we have a path that doesn't participate
in the sequence,


170
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,546 line:-2
which is the shape illustrating
the speaker,


171
00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:15.883 line:-2 align:center
and we have paths
that do participate in the sequence,


172
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,820 line:-2
which are the three waves
that define the volume's strength:


173
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:24,191 line:-2
low volume, mid-volume,
and high volume.


174
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,027 line:-1
These paths are organized into layers,


175
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,065 line:-2
and the selected layers opt-in
to the Variable Color feature.


176
00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:35.936 line:-2 align:center
We represent their strength
with percentage values:


177
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,105 line:0
0% is entirely off,


178
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:42,376 align:center
anything above 0%
will highlight part of the symbol,


179
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:48,582 line:0
and the whole symbol will be fully
highlighted as the value approaches 100%.


180
00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:51.385 line:-2 align:center
One important thing to know
is that Variable Color


181
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,654 line:-1
is not meant to create depth;


182
00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:58.125 line:-2 align:center
instead, it's meant to highlight
a sequence of steps or stages


183
00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.561 line:-1 align:center
that the symbol can represent.


184
00:11:00.594 --> 00:11:03.497 line:-2 align:center
For example,
let's imagine I need a symbol


185
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.366 line:-2 align:center
to represent people's capacity
inside a room.


186
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.969 line:-1 align:center
This symbol looks great for that.


187
00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.638 line:-1 align:center
Let's look at it in more detail.


188
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:15,275 line:-2
We don't want to highlight
just one part of the symbol.


189
00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:20.747 line:-2 align:center
Instead, we need to think of the symbol
as a sequence or a range.


190
00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:23.283 line:-1 align:center
My goal is to cover different states:


191
00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:25.352 line:-1 align:center
the room is empty,


192
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,222 line:-1
the room has few people in it,


193
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:32,659 line:-2
the room is half-full,
and the room is at full capacity.


194
00:11:32.693 --> 00:11:36.129 line:-1 align:center
So now, when I opt into Variable Color,


195
00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:38.699 line:-2 align:center
I can easily see
the graphic representation


196
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,602 line:-2
of the different states
I'm trying to convey.


197
00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:45.772 line:-2 align:center
And there are no limits to how
many paths can opt into the feature.


198
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:48,008 line:-1
There can be just one or many.


199
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:52.012 line:-2 align:center
You decide what is the design strategy
that best suits your needs.


200
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:56,617 line:-2
If you want to represent the strength
level of shapes that follow a sequence,


201
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,920 line:-1
like waves, rays, ellipsis, and layers,


202
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,890 line:-1
you can do so with Variable Color.


203
00:12:02.923 --> 00:12:07.561 line:-2 align:center
Variable Color is opacity based
and it's available in all rendering modes.


204
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:14,168 line:-2
This year, we have made annotations for
custom symbols faster and easier to use


205
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:18.705 line:-2 align:center
by creating a unified layer
structure across all rendering modes.


206
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,775 line:-2
I love baking,
and I was thinking of designing an app


207
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,977 line:-1
with cupcake-only recipes.


208
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,713 line:-1
I wanted to create my own custom symbols,


209
00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:29.683 line:-2 align:center
so I've designed a set
that will cover my needs.


210
00:12:29.716 --> 00:12:33.287 line:-2 align:center
This will be an excellent opportunity
to show you how to annotate symbols


211
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.989 line:-1 align:center
with the unified layer structure approach


212
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:40,194 line:-2
and how to annotate symbols
that participate in Variable Color.


213
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:43,197 line:-1
Let's use these two as an example.


214
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,134 line:-2
Before we start annotating,
there are a few things to consider:


215
00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:52.472 line:-2 align:center
we need to keep the hierarchy in mind
and make sure we outline the z-order.


216
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:58,545 line:0
The z-order refers to the order
of the paths in a symbol along the z-axis.


217
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,583 line:0
There are also two new concepts
you need to be aware of:


218
00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:05.085 line:-1 align:center
Draw and Erase.


219
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.989 line:-2 align:center
These are used to help define the way
a layer renders.


220
00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:12.559 line:-2 align:center
For example,
here we have the paths of a symbol


221
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:16,163 line:-2
representing a square
overlapping a circle.


222
00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:19.066 line:-2 align:center
When selecting the layers
containing the square,


223
00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:21.068 line:-1 align:center
if we choose the Draw option,


224
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:24.638 line:-2 align:center
the layer will draw the paths
contained in that layer.


225
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,974 line:-1
If we choose the Erase option,


226
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:30,310 line:-2
the layer will erase the path
containing the layer,


227
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:33,347 line:-1
affecting how the symbol is rendered.


228
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,149 line:-1
Now, let's start annotating the cupcake.


229
00:13:36.183 --> 00:13:39.953 line:-2 align:center
As a first step, we need to organize
the paths in layers


230
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,723 line:-1
to create the desired hierarchy.


231
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:47,361 line:-2
If I analyze it closely,
I can see four main shapes:


232
00:13:47.394 --> 00:13:50.564 line:-1 align:center
the frosting, the cupcake base,


233
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:53,033 line:-1
the badge, and the plus.


234
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:56,403 line:-2
You can add as many paths as needed
to a layer.


235
00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:59.773 line:-2 align:center
So in this case,
the frosting will be defined


236
00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:02.476 line:-1 align:center
by a layer with three different paths,


237
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:07,447 line:-2
and the rest of the layers will be defined
by just one path each.


238
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:12,085 line:-2
Organizing the shapes in this way
allows us to have more flexibility


239
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:15,722 line:-2
when annotating one structure
for all rendering modes.


240
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:18,892 line:-2
Now we have all the information
we need in one place


241
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,428 line:-1
to customize the symbol as needed.


242
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:26,166 line:-2
Now we can start annotating
all rendering modes.


243
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,735 line:-1
Let's look at Multicolor first.


244
00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:31.038 line:-1 align:center
I already have the shapes set up,


245
00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:33.774 line:-1 align:center
so I just need to choose the right colors.


246
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,210 line:-1
Red Velvet is my favorite flavor,


247
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:41,215 line:-2
so I'll choose white for the frosting
and red for the cupcake base.


248
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:44,818 line:-2
Now I will follow the same logic
that SF Symbols defines


249
00:14:44.852 --> 00:14:47.554 line:-1 align:center
for the plus badges in Multicolor:


250
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:50,824 line:-2
green for the badge
and white for the plus.


251
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:54,294 line:-1
Okay, this is looking great so far.


252
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,296 line:-1
Now, let's focus on the badge.


253
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,834 line:-2
This is where the unified annotation
approach is more apparent.


254
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:03,203 line:-1
We already defined Multicolor.


255
00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:06.406 line:-2 align:center
Now let's look at Hierarchical
and Palette.


256
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.843 line:-2 align:center
Because of the use of hierarchy
in this rendering modes,


257
00:15:09.877 --> 00:15:12.379 line:-1 align:center
I would expect the badge to be Primary,


258
00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:17.217 line:-2 align:center
which will render it white
on a black background, like this one.


259
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:21,355 line:-2
Now I need the plus shape
to erase part of the badge.


260
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:24,224 line:-2
This is where the Erase selection
is helpful.


261
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,394 line:-2
I will be able to see the badge
rendered as desired


262
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:32,566 line:-2
by erasing a part of a shape
when the layers overlap.


263
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,170 line:-2
Finally, I just need
the Monochrome annotation.


264
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:39,406 line:-2
Because there is no added complexity
in this rendering mode,


265
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,308 line:-1
I will follow the same logic,


266
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:46,213 line:-2
making the plus shape
erase part of the badge shape.


267
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,115 line:-1
I'm almost done now.


268
00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:50.918 line:-1 align:center
I just need a few extra details.


269
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,987 line:-2
For Hierarchical and Palette,
I just need to annotate


270
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:57.191 line:-2 align:center
the rest of the cupcake shape
as Secondary.


271
00:15:57.224 --> 00:16:01.528 line:-2 align:center
For Palette, I will choose a color
to give a bit of contrast.


272
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:04,364 line:-2
And for Monochrome,
I just need to make sure


273
00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:07.668 line:-2 align:center
I have the remaining shapes
opting into Draw.


274
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:11,038 line:-1
That's all I need.


275
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:14,942 line:-2
The cupcake is ready and customized
for all rendering modes.


276
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:19,213 line:-1
Now let's look at the kitchen timer.


277
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:23,217 line:-2
The paths represent the time passing,
and since this is a sequence,


278
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.221 line:-2 align:center
it's a great candidate
to participate in Variable Color.


279
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,390 line:0
We can use the same strategy
to annotate this symbol,


280
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:33,961 align:center
but instead of grouping
the timer paths in one layer,


281
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,764 line:0
we need to split them
with each in its own layer.


282
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,367 align:center
This is because
we need to organize the shapes


283
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,703 line:0
to allow us to recreate the sequence


284
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:47,307 align:center
that will help us communicate
the different states of the symbol.


285
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:51,745 line:-2
And remember that Variable Color
works in all rendering modes.


286
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,015 line:0
If you want to learn more about
the new Variable Color feature


287
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,050 line:0
and the SF Symbols app,


288
00:16:57,084 --> 00:17:02,523 line:0
check out Paul's talk
"Adopt Variable Color in SF Symbols.”


289
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,826 line:0
You can find the new beta version
of the SF Symbols app,


290
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,329 line:0

293
00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:22.209 line:-2 align:center
From Automatic Rendering behavior
to the Variable Color dynamic nature,


294
00:17:22.242 --> 00:17:25.646 line:-2 align:center
SF Symbols are an extremely powerful tool
to use


295
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,682 line:-1
when implementing symbols in your UIs.


296
00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:32.486 line:-2 align:center
And this year,
SF Symbols is even more powerful,


297
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,223 line:-2
with features that define
a spectrum of expression.


298
00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:37.891 line:-1 align:center
Thank you for joining today.


299
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:41,929 line:-2
I hope you enjoyed learning
about what's new in SF Symbols.
