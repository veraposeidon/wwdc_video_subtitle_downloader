Nicholas: Hi.
I’m Nicholas Felton,


4
00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:14.047 line:-2 align:center
a designer
on the Human Interface team.


5
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:17.718 line:-2 align:center
Today I’ll be talking about how to build
great app experiences using charts.


6
00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:21.321 line:-2 align:center
Charts are a great way to communicate
complex information.


7
00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.057 line:-2 align:center
We use them throughout Apple
to enhance our products.


8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,962 line:-2
Health uses charts to help us understand
our bodies,


9
00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.965 line:-2 align:center
Fitness inspires us
to stay active with charts,


10
00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.401 line:-2 align:center
and Weather displays charts
to help us plan our day.


11
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,105 line:-1
We know that developers love them as well,


12
00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:41.341 line:-2 align:center
and we see inspiring examples
in every category.


13
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,545 line:-2
From the detailed workout analysis
in Strava


14
00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:47.014 line:-2 align:center
to the playful progress charts
in Duolingo.


15
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,350 line:-2
Charts can be found everywhere, and when
well-designed,


16
00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.019 line:-1 align:center
can reveal subtleties in data


17
00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.555 line:-2 align:center
that you cannot communicate easily
through text.


18
00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:58.091 line:-2 align:center
In addition to their utility, charts
are also an opportunity


19
00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:01.828 line:-2 align:center
to support the personality of your app
and add visual interest to your UI.


20
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,166 line:-2
To demonstrate how an app can be enhanced
with charts,


21
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.435 line:-2 align:center
let’s look at one made
for the owner of a food truck


22
00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:09.736 line:-1 align:center
selling pancakes.


23
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.340 line:-2 align:center
The app currently has a tab
for entering orders,


24
00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.543 line:-2 align:center
and another for viewing
recent transactions.


25
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,879 line:-2
This works fine for keeping track
of sales,


26
00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:22.149 line:-2 align:center
but this information could be
much more useful.


27
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,718 line:0
This year, we’re introducing Swift Charts.


28
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,156 align:center
With this framework, making charts
for Apple devices has never been easier.


29
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,426 align:center
In the following sections, I will share
the principles we follow


30
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,962 line:0
when designing experiences
with charts at Apple.


31
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:38,065 line:0
We will apply these concepts to create
wireframes


32
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,068 align:center
for a more informative version
of the food truck app.


33
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.971 line:-2 align:center
In order to build a great experience
with charts,


34
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.906 line:-1 align:center
we should consider three things:


35
00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.008 line:-1 align:center
when to use charts,


36
00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.743 line:-1 align:center
how to use them,


37
00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:53.614 line:-2 align:center
and how they relate to each other
in a chart design system.


38
00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:56.683 line:-2 align:center
Let’s begin by discussing
when to use charts in an app.


39
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,586 line:-2
Here are some common cases
where a chart can elevate


40
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.522 line:-1 align:center
the information being presented:


41
00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:04.691 line:-3 align:center
When showing historical
or predicted values,


42
00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:07.394 line:-3 align:center
a chart can vividly demonstrate
changes in data.


43
00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:12.466 line:-3 align:center
By visualizing a portion of a whole,
we can use charts to show the state


44
00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:16.737 line:-3 align:center
of something that is completing,
progressing towards a goal, or emptying.


45
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:22.676 line:-3 align:center
When comparing items or categories, we can
easily evaluate their values with charts.


46
00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:26.713 line:-2 align:center
To decide whether any
of these approaches


47
00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:30.684 line:-2 align:center
are appropriate for your app,
consider what the experience needs first.


48
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,954 line:-2
How will a chart support
the core goals of your app?


49
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,224 line:-1
When used correctly, charts provide focus.


50
00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:39.993 line:-2 align:center
As an app creator,
there are many things you could visualize,


51
00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:42.496 line:-2 align:center
but only the most important information
should become a chart.


52
00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:46.366 line:-2 align:center
For someone using an app,
charts are a strong signal.


53
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.003 line:-2 align:center
They direct attention to the information
you want them to understand.


54
00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:53.273 line:-2 align:center
The goal of the food truck app
is to improve the operation


55
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,175 line:-1
of the businesses using it.


56
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,412 line:-2
If we can use charts to turn
a list of transactions


57
00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:00.180 line:-1 align:center
into actionable information,


58
00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:04.051 line:-2 align:center
food truck owners
will welcome the improvement.


59
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:08,155 line:-2
Here is some key information that we know
will be useful to food truck owners:


60
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.957 line:-1 align:center
viewing recent sales,


61
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.825 line:-1 align:center
understanding what items are popular,


62
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,862 line:-2
and knowing the best location
to visit each day.


63
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:19,433 line:-2
As you consider your app, remember
that charts should direct attention


64
00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:23.203 line:-2 align:center
and provide focus to the most
important information in your experience.


65
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,273 line:-2
Now that we’ve established
what we want to communicate,


66
00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.809 line:-2 align:center
let’s look
at how to achieve this using charts.


67
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,613 line:-2
To illustrate recent sales,
a chart showing change over time


68
00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:33.981 line:-1 align:center
will be appropriate.


69
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,951 line:-2
One way of doing this is to use
a bar chart showing sales totals


70
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,354 line:-1
for each of the last 30 days.


71
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:43.790 line:-2 align:center
We will add axis labels soon,
but first, it needs a description


72
00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:45.626 line:-1 align:center
to tell someone what the chart represents.


73
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:51,365 line:-2
A title like "Sales in the Past 30 Days"
labels the elements of the chart


74
00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:53.534 line:-1 align:center
but doesn’t communicate anything more.


75
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,736 line:-2
How can we summarize
the information being shown?


76
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:00,741 line:-2
A chart should be accompanied by text
that describes the chart contents.


77
00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:04.044 line:-2 align:center
If read in isolation,
it should be informative.


78
00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:07.848 line:-2 align:center
Adding the total number of pancakes sold
transforms the title


79
00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:10.217 line:-1 align:center
into a self-contained description.


80
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.554 line:-2 align:center
Now someone can quickly gather
key information from the text,


81
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,689 line:-2
while the chart
provides supporting details.


82
00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:20.327 line:-2 align:center
When a chart is not straightforward,
using a complete sentence


83
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,696 line:-2
for the description can make
it easier to understand.


84
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,803 line:-2
For example: "Sales in the past 30 days
totaled 1,234 pancakes."


85
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,708 line:-2
Another way of framing the chart
is to interpret the data.


86
00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:38.645 line:-2 align:center
For example: "Sales for the past 30
days are up 12%,


87
00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:41.815 line:-1 align:center
totaling 1,234 pancakes."


88
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,684 line:-1
This will help someone understand


89
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,954 line:-2
if the level of recent sales
is high or low


90
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,223 line:-1
or if it is increasing or decreasing.


91
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,226 line:-2
This technique can make
a description more meaningful,


92
00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.194 line:-1 align:center
particularly when the data is unfamiliar.


93
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,765 line:-2
Each of these approaches is
a good way of describing a chart,


94
00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:02.369 line:-2 align:center
but this overview is just one way
of explaining our sales data.


95
00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:05.405 line:-2 align:center
What else can we do
to illuminate these transactions?


96
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,910 line:-2
Try to incorporate details
from other perspectives.


97
00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:13.280 line:-2 align:center
It’s important to summarize your data,
but when we find ways


98
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,450 line:-2
to elevate categories or highlight
individual records,


99
00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.485 line:-1 align:center
a chart becomes multi-dimensional.


100
00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:21.321 line:-2 align:center
Here are some additional perspectives
to consider:


101
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:25,192 line:-2
At a macro level, we look for ways to
describe the entire data set,


102
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:28,795 line:-1
like a total, or average value.


103
00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:32.533 line:-2 align:center
At a medium scale,
we look at sub-sets of data.


104
00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:36.403 line:-2 align:center
These might be time-based,
like comparing weekdays to weekends


105
00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:40.607 line:-2 align:center
or investigating changes
related to the time of day.


106
00:05:40.641 --> 00:05:43.777 line:-2 align:center
Other approaches might categorize
sales by the style of pancake


107
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,746 line:-1
or the city where they were sold.


108
00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:50.651 line:-2 align:center
At the micro level,
we focus on individual data points.


109
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:55,055 line:0
The last transaction or largest sale
are important small-scale details


110
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,957 align:center
you may want to call out in your charts.


111
00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:02.629 line:-2 align:center
The more carefully you observe a data set,
the more detail will emerge.


112
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:05,766 line:-2
Some of the perspectives
we’ve identified could be useful


113
00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:09.503 line:-2 align:center
to food truck owners planning
their inventory or sales locations.


114
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,940 line:-2
It would be useful to augment
the recent sales chart


115
00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:14.842 line:-1 align:center
with some of these details.


116
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:19,146 line:-2
To do this, we can use a set
of tappable rows under the chart.


117
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,416 line:-2
Each row provides a summary statistic,
and when tapped,


118
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,384 line:-1
the chart is updated to match.


119
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,855 line:-1
We can show the daily average value


120
00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:33.160 line:-2 align:center
or the difference between weekday
and weekend sales


121
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,195 line:-1
or the best sales day.


122
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,665 line:-2
These overlays can be extremely useful,
but this amount of information


123
00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.068 line:-2 align:center
requires a large surface
to work effectively.


124
00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:46.206 line:-2 align:center
As the functionality of a chart increases,
so will its size.


125
00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:49.276 line:-1 align:center
Smaller charts tend to be static.


126
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.945 line:-1 align:center
Examples include Watch complications,


127
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,015 line:-2
the repeating thumbnail charts
in Stocks,


128
00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:56.817 line:-1 align:center
and the trend platters in Health.


129
00:06:57.384 --> 00:06:59.953 line:-1 align:center
Static charts rarely exist in isolation.


130
00:06:59.987 --> 00:07:04.491 line:-2 align:center
They tend to provide a preview
of a larger chart in another view.


131
00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:07.861 line:-2 align:center
As they are generally small,
static charts don’t require grid lines,


132
00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:10.163 line:-1 align:center
labels, or interactivity,


133
00:07:10.197 --> 00:07:14.334 line:-2 align:center
since they create the expectation
that additional detail is just a tap away.


134
00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:16.803 line:-1 align:center
Interactive charts tend to be larger,


135
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,572 line:-1
and include much more detail,


136
00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.542 line:-1 align:center
like the charts in Stocks and in Health.


137
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:25.479 line:-2 align:center
An interactive chart will typically be
the width of your view,


138
00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:26.880 line:-1 align:center
but not full-height.


139
00:07:26.914 --> 00:07:31.451 line:-2 align:center
You should include axis lines and labels
so that values can be estimated.


140
00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:36.990 line:-2 align:center
Interactivity is recommended at this size
for accessing precise values


141
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,492 line:-1
in the chart


142
00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:43.730 line:-2 align:center
and the ability to change the time range
or time scope will aid exploration.


143
00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:49.770 line:-2 align:center
The largest and most interactive charts
allow for deep investigation of data


144
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:52.339 line:-1 align:center
and require the most vertical space.


145
00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:54.875 line:-2 align:center
As charts become more powerful,
it’s important


146
00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:57.845 line:-2 align:center
to introduce
additional functionality gradually.


147
00:07:57.878 --> 00:08:00.781 line:-2 align:center
You should progressively reveal
chart complexity


148
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,083 line:-2
so that someone can choose
the level of information


149
00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:04.718 line:-1 align:center
that matches their interest.


150
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.691 line:-2 align:center
Use a small static chart higher
in the navigation hierarchy


151
00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:13.493 line:-2 align:center
to offer a path to expanded versions
of the chart.


152
00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:17.898 line:-2 align:center
When you create a link
between two versions of the same chart,


153
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,234 line:-2
that progression should maintain
continuity


154
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,403 line:-1
by preserving values, context and state.


155
00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:28.542 line:-2 align:center
Keep in mind that when someone
expresses interest in a chart,


156
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:32,045 line:-2
they want to see more of what
they have already seen.


157
00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:35.148 line:-2 align:center
This means that a chart
should retain its shape


158
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,252 line:-2
and any numbers apparent
in an earlier view should be preserved.


159
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:43.056 line:-2 align:center
You can add information,
but showing something different


160
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,158 line:-1
can be frustrating or disorienting.


161
00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:50.097 line:-2 align:center
While we’re considering the functionality
of different sized charts,


162
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,899 line:-1
let’s revisit our food truck app


163
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,568 line:-2
to determine where our planned charts
will go.


164
00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:58.805 line:-2 align:center
We currently have two tabs,
one dedicated to placing orders,


165
00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.241 line:-1 align:center
and a second that shows the sales history.


166
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,610 line:-2
These records
are what we will be visualizing,


167
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,413 line:-2
so it makes sense to adapt
this view to include our charts.


168
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:11,084 line:-2
Let’s clear the tab by moving
the sales to a separate view


169
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,221 line:-2
behind a "View all sales"
navigational element.


170
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,657 line:-2
We now have a prominent canvas
for our charts.


171
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.560 line:-2 align:center
As a result,
it’s appropriate to use a static chart


172
00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:22.930 line:-2 align:center
that lets someone scan the data
and decide whether they want to see more.


173
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,368 line:-2
Here’s the static chart
showing recent sales.


174
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:32,606 line:-2
Tapping the platter
leads to an expanded interactive chart.


175
00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:35.576 line:-2 align:center
We now have
a complete recent sales experience.


176
00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:38.679 line:-2 align:center
This interactive chart
will support detailed analysis


177
00:09:38.712 --> 00:09:42.216 line:-2 align:center
with 30-day and 1-year views,
touch states,


178
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,951 line:-1
and tappable summary statistics.


179
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:49,857 align:center
As you’re working on your app,
remember that charts need descriptions


180
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,459 line:0
to inform the contents
and provide a key takeaway,


181
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:56,763 align:center
the details in your data can add richness
to your charts,


182
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,000 align:center
and that you should progressively reveal
chart complexity within your app.


183
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,537 line:-1
Now let’s look at chart design systems.


184
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,839 line:-2
When your app includes
more than one chart,


185
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:08,008 line:-1
you’ve created a chart design system.


186
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,245 line:-2
Here are some things to remember
when planning multiple charts:


187
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,915 line:-1
Use familiar forms.


188
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,452 line:-2
Start with common chart styles
to aid comprehension.


189
00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:20.988 line:-2 align:center
If someone has
already used a similar chart,


190
00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:23.991 line:-2 align:center
they will be more likely
to understand yours.


191
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:29,596 line:0
Bar charts and line charts are forms
that many people encounter and use daily,


192
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,499 line:0
while a scatter plot
is less common and may require


193
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:35,936 line:0
extra guidance to ensure that
it is interpreted correctly.


194
00:10:36.637 --> 00:10:40.474 line:-2 align:center
If you want to do something unique,
it should be introduced clearly,


195
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:44,411 line:-2
as demonstrated here
in the onboarding flow for Activity.


196
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,181 line:-1
After the activity rings are introduced,


197
00:10:47.214 --> 00:10:54.121 line:-2 align:center
they are split apart to show the move,
exercise, and stand components.


198
00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.826 line:-2 align:center
Ideally, a new form is central
to your app, not supplementary.


199
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.763 line:-2 align:center
The prominence you give a novel chart
will encourage people


200
00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:04.398 line:-1 align:center
to explore and understand it.


201
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,035 line:-1
When creating supporting charts,


202
00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:09.803 line:-1 align:center
familiar forms are more important,


203
00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:11.872 line:-2 align:center
as they will not be given
as much prominence.


204
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.443 line:-2 align:center
Differences matter,
and the variations between charts


205
00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:18.378 line:-1 align:center
are a signal that something has changed.


206
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:24,051 line:-2
To demonstrate this, let’s start
with two copies of our recent sales chart.


207
00:11:24.084 --> 00:11:28.288 line:-2 align:center
I’ll slowly update the chart on the right
to communicate different information,


208
00:11:28.322 --> 00:11:32.893 line:-2 align:center
and we'll show how the design evolves
to signal these distinctions.


209
00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:36.663 line:-2 align:center
First, I’ll change the time scope
of the chart on the right.


210
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:41,602 line:-2
Rather than showing recent sales,
it now shows sales for the last 12 months.


211
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:47,140 line:-2
I have changed the description and updated
the chart to show 12 months of data.


212
00:11:47.174 --> 00:11:50.844 line:-2 align:center
Minimal changes
are required for this modification.


213
00:11:50.878 --> 00:11:54.515 line:-2 align:center
If I want to change the type of data
being displayed in the right-hand chart,


214
00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:57.451 line:-2 align:center
it may not be sufficient
to only change the description.


215
00:11:58.352 --> 00:12:00.721 line:-2 align:center
Noticing this change in text
could be easily missed,


216
00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:03.757 line:-1 align:center
so an additional change is necessary.


217
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,094 line:-2
Giving each of these charts
a distinct color helps.


218
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,631 line:-2
Now it is easier to notice
that these charts are unique.


219
00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:13.133 line:-2 align:center
Creating this difference
makes it more likely


220
00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:15.469 line:-2 align:center
that someone will now read
the description.


221
00:12:17.604 --> 00:12:20.474 line:-2 align:center
Finally, I want to update the chart
on the right


222
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:24,545 line:-2
to show the range of daily sales
for each of past 12 months.


223
00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:27.214 line:-2 align:center
This requires both a change
to the description


224
00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.183 line:-1 align:center
and the way that the data is represented.


225
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,220 line:-2
To underscore
the significance of this change,


226
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,889 line:-2
modifying the styling
of the bars is appropriate.


227
00:12:36.657 --> 00:12:39.860 line:-2 align:center
The chart on the right
now conveys a different subject,


228
00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:42.429 line:-2 align:center
different time range,
and different metrics.


229
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,631 line:-1
The design is purposefully distinct


230
00:12:44.665 --> 00:12:47.234 line:-2 align:center
to ensure that these differences
will be noticed.


231
00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:50.370 line:-2 align:center
We can apply these principles
to the two other charts


232
00:12:50.404 --> 00:12:51.939 line:-1 align:center
we need for our food truck app.


233
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.643 line:-2 align:center
To compliment the recent sales,
I’d like to add another chart


234
00:12:56.677 --> 00:12:59.213 line:-2 align:center
that shows
the most popular style of pancake.


235
00:13:00.147 --> 00:13:04.051 line:-2 align:center
One way of showing the most popular style
is to compare the relative sales level


236
00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:05.786 line:-1 align:center
for each pancake.


237
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.056 line:-2 align:center
Since we are interested
in the last 30 days as a whole,


238
00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:12.259 line:-2 align:center
we only need one bar to compare
the popularity of styles.


239
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:17,197 line:-2
If I separate the bars,
I can compare their sizes more clearly,


240
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:19.900 line:-2 align:center
but this starts to look
like a time series chart again.


241
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,605 line:-2
By making the bars horizontal,
I can accentuate the difference


242
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,940 line:-2
between this chart
and the recent sales chart.


243
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:32,012 line:-2
The horizontal orientation also
lets me make the bars longer


244
00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:34.848 line:-2 align:center
without needing to make the platter
on the sales tab taller.


245
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:40,320 line:-2
In this preview platter, I’ve omitted
labels to focus only on the top style.


246
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:46,560 line:-2
In the detail view, each bar is labeled,
and the relative values are visible.


247
00:13:47.628 --> 00:13:50.197 line:-2 align:center
For our final chart,
we would like to show sales


248
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.066 line:-2 align:center
in the two cities where the truck operates
for each day of the week.


249
00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:56.703 line:-2 align:center
For this, we will need to do
something a bit specialized.


250
00:13:56,737 --> 00:14:01,008 line:-2
The context for this chart
is sales by day of the week.


251
00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:03.977 line:-2 align:center
In this case, we want to look
at each day independently.


252
00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:07.548 line:-2 align:center
Here are the average daily sales
for each day of the week


253
00:14:07.581 --> 00:14:09.149 line:-1 align:center
over the past 30 days.


254
00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:13.453 line:-2 align:center
As the food truck operates
in both Cupertino and San Francisco,


255
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:17,457 line:-2
we need to split these bars
to represent each location.


256
00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:22.596 line:-2 align:center
Finally, let’s convert these bars
into lines to focus on the daily changes.


257
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,898 line:-1
I’ve added this chart to the sales tab


258
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:28,035 line:-2
and included a description
to summarize the data.


259
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,038 line:-2
In this case, the best sales day
over the past 30 days


260
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,674 line:-1
was Sunday in San Francisco.


261
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:38,412 line:-2
The subsequent detail page
is the last chart we will add to the app.


262
00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:40.948 line:-2 align:center
It provides additional interactivity
and details,


263
00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:43.183 line:-1 align:center
including keys for the two lines.


264
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,187 line:-2
We’ve now sketched out the set of charts
we plan to add


265
00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:49.289 line:-1 align:center
to the pancake food truck app.


266
00:14:49.323 --> 00:14:52.626 line:-2 align:center
Using charts to show recent sales,
popular items,


267
00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:54.294 line:-1 align:center
and top days and locations


268
00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:57.030 line:-2 align:center
will dramatically improve
the utility of this app.


269
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:02,736 align:center
As you work on your app, remember
to use familiar chart forms


270
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,738 align:center
to assist comprehension


271
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,674 line:0
and intentionally create differences
between your charts


272
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,877 line:0
to improve their interpretation.


273
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.180 line:-2 align:center
In this talk,
we discussed when to use charts,


274
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:17,684 line:-2
how to use them, and how they relate
to each other in a chart design system.


275
00:15:17.718 --> 00:15:20.954 line:-2 align:center
Applying these principles will help you
communicate data in your app


276
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,690 line:-1
with more clarity and appeal.


277
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:25,993 line:-1
To continue learning about chart design,


278
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,929 align:center
you can watch "Design an Effective Chart,"


279
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,731 line:1
or for an introduction to Swift Charts,


280
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,165 align:center
watch "Hello Swift Charts."


281
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:38,105 line:-1
