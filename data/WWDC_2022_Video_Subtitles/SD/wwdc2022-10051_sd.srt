August Joki: Hello, I'm August Joki,


4
00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:13.113 line:-1 align:center
a software engineer on watchOS,


5
00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:18.519 line:-2 align:center
and I'm here to show you how to go further
with WidgetKit complications.


6
00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:22.189 line:-2 align:center
I hope you've seen the wonderful
Complications and Widgets: Reloaded talk


7
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:26,260 line:-2
first, covering the basics
of complications in WidgetKit.


8
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:29,029 line:-2
This talk expands
on the concepts covered there


9
00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:33.066 line:-2 align:center
as they relate to complications
on the watch faces.


10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,238 line:0
And my WWDC 2020 talk:
Build complications in SwiftUI


11
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:43,477 line:0
covers more specifics about tinting
and SwiftUI drawing in complications.


12
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:46.713 line:-2 align:center
In this talk,
I'll be discussing the WidgetKit features


13
00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:48.782 line:-1 align:center
unique to watchOS,


14
00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.351 line:-2 align:center
as well as how to migrate your,
and your users',


15
00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:54.421 line:-2 align:center
existing ClockKit complications
to WidgetKit.


16
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,424 line:-2
I've taken inspiration from
the Coffee Tracker sample app


17
00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.793 line:-2 align:center
to use as an example
throughout this talk.


18
00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.896 line:-2 align:center
The app records the number of coffees,
teas, and sodas


19
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.598 line:-1 align:center
you drink throughout the day


20
00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:08.669 line:-2 align:center
and tracks the amount of caffeine
in your body over time.


21
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:12,072 line:-1
Let's start with what's unique to watchOS.


22
00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.975 line:-2 align:center
In iOS 16
we brought complication style widgets


23
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:16.810 line:-1 align:center
to the phone's lock screen


24
00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:21.682 line:-2 align:center
and in watchOS 9 we brought WidgetKit
to the watch's complications.


25
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:25,352 line:-2
On the watch faces we have
a unique complication presentation


26
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,087 line:-1
for the corners of the watch screen.


27
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.623 line:-1 align:center
And it requires a unique WidgetKit family


28
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:33,060 line:-1
called accessoryCorner, to describe it.


29
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,230 line:-2
Part of that unique presentation
is auxiliary content


30
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,298 line:-1
specified by your SwiftUI view,


31
00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:40.400 line:-1 align:center
but not rendered as part of your content.


32
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,836 line:-1
Instead, it is rendered by the watch face.


33
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.407 line:-2 align:center
The circular part of the corner
is standard SwiftUI rendering


34
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.878 line:-2 align:center
and the auxiliary content
is the curved part in the corners.


35
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.682 line:-1 align:center
Or in the dial on the Infograph face.


36
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,856 line:-2
The accessoryInline family
has a unique behavior on watch faces.


37
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.361 line:-2 align:center
It has multiple ways of being rendered
depending on the face.


38
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,697 line:-1
Sometimes flat,


39
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,766 line:-1
sometimes curved to match the dial.


40
00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:17.237 line:-2 align:center
Let's talk about how to support
these unique features


41
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,475 line:-2
by looking at how the coffee tracker app
might be updated to use WidgetKit.


42
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.580 line:-2 align:center
In addition to the three new
complication-styled widget families


43
00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:30.017 line:-2 align:center
on iOS 16:
AccessoryRectangular,


44
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.021 line:-2 align:center
accessoryCircular,
and accessoryInline,


45
00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:37.958 line:-2 align:center
we have a fourth family on watchOS 9
called accessoryCorner.


46
00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:43.330 line:-2 align:center
accessoryCorner can either be shown
as a large circular content,


47
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:47,768 line:-2
like the maps and heart rate
complications shown in the lower corners,


48
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:51.939 line:-2 align:center
or as smaller circular content
with a curved label or gauge


49
00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:56.009 line:-2 align:center
like the coffee tracker and moonphase
complications shown in the upper corners.


50
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,081 line:-2
To control whether
the inner auxiliary content is shown,


51
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:06,153 line:-2
watchOS 9 has added a new view modifier
you can use, which I'll show you now.


52
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,625 line:-2
Let's look at building a corner
complication for my coffee tracker app.


53
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.163 line:-2 align:center
Starting with the larger
circular content style,


54
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:19.933 line:-2 align:center
I have a ZStack
with an SF Symbol and a background.


55
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,936 line:-2
The SwiftUI content is
automatically clipped to a circle


56
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,807 line:-2
to keep in line with the design
of the other corner complications.


57
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:32,212 line:-2
To add the inner curved content,
we use the new to watchOS 9


58
00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:34.581 line:-1 align:center
widgetLabel view modifier.


59
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:38,886 line:-2
The watch face extracts the contents
of the modifier to draw the control


60
00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.890 line:-2 align:center
appropriate for the family
and the style of the watch face.


61
00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:47.261 line:-2 align:center
And the circular content
automatically scales down to make room.


62
00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:51.231 line:-2 align:center
For accessoryCorner
you can specify a SwiftUI text, gauge,


63
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:54,201 line:-1
or progressView in your widget's label.


64
00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:59.373 line:-2 align:center
AccessoryCorner isn't the only family
that supports widgetLabel.


65
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:03.510 line:-2 align:center
Let's look at how it is used
on the accessoryCircular family.


66
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,482 line:-2
On the Infograph watch face,
in addition to the corner complications,


67
00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:12.586 line:-2 align:center
there are four circular complications
inside the dial.


68
00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:16.256 line:-2 align:center
My coffee tracker circular complication,
in the middle top,


69
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,560 line:-2
looks very similar to the corner
complication we just saw,


70
00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:21.295 line:-1 align:center
but with text in the dial.


71
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,430 line:-1
I'll show you how to add that text now.


72
00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:28.168 line:-2 align:center
For my circular complication design,
I thought it more appropriate


73
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,370 line:-2
to move the gauge
that was in the widgetLabel


74
00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:34.107 line:-2 align:center
in my corner complication,
to be front and center.


75
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:37,311 line:-2
To take advantage of the top
middle position on Infograph,


76
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:41,481 line:-2
I add a widgetLabel to the gauge
in order to display additional text


77
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:46,453 line:-2
in the longer bezel area that wouldn't
otherwise fit in the circular content.


78
00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:49.156 line:-2 align:center
But now I have redundant information
between the main view


79
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.892 line:-1 align:center
and the text above it.


80
00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:54.695 line:-2 align:center
I can clean that up
by switching the circular content


81
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:59,733 line:-2
to that good looking coffee cup SF Symbol
from my corner complication


82
00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:02.903 line:-2 align:center
But when I switch to a face
showing my circular complication


83
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,438 line:-1
that does not have the bezel,


84
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,540 line:-1
then I've lost all of my caffeine info.


85
00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:10.110 line:-2 align:center
Luckily, there's a piece of API I can add
to make my complication work


86
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,311 line:-1
in both cases.


87
00:05:13.247 --> 00:05:16.350 line:-2 align:center
I update my complication
to add the Environment property


88
00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:19.052 line:-1 align:center
called showsWidgetLabel to my view.


89
00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:22.422 line:-2 align:center
This will be true whenever
the complication is in a position


90
00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:26.226 line:-2 align:center
on the watch face that shows
the content in the widget's label.


91
00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:33.500 line:-2 align:center
And then I can change the content
to depend on the value of showsWidgetLabel


92
00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:38.972 line:-2 align:center
so I am able to have the appropriate level
of information in each complication spot.


93
00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:42.776 line:-2 align:center
I just demonstrated two different ways
that the accessoryCircular family


94
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,378 line:-1
can show up on watch faces,


95
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,014 line:-2
and there is one more way
you need to be aware of.


96
00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:51.552 line:-2 align:center
The Extra Large watch face has long been
a great way for people to see the time


97
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,688 line:-1
in an extra large format.


98
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,091 line:-2
And it supports a single,
large circular complication.


99
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,295 line:-2
The Extra Large face uses
the accessoryCircular family


100
00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:06.533 line:-2 align:center
and automatically scales up the content
to match the style of the face.


101
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,769 line:-2
Please note:
as this face is designed


102
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,737 line:-1
to have a single, large complication,


103
00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:13.340 line:-1 align:center
do not use the increased canvas size


104
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,710 line:-2
as an opportunity
to densely pack your complication.


105
00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:22.216 line:-2 align:center
The content should be identical to
the normal circular family, only larger.


106
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,285 line:-2
As I mentioned earlier,
there are two more widget families used


107
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,857 line:-2
on watch faces:
accessoryRectangular and accessoryInline.


108
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.560 line:-2 align:center
There are no faces with rectangular
complications that show the widgetLabel.


109
00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:37.931 line:-2 align:center
And the accessoryInline family acts,
already, as a widgetLabel.


110
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:42,002 line:-2
The watch face extracts Images
and Texts from your inline content


111
00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:45.506 line:-2 align:center
and renders them itself
to match the look of the face.


112
00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.075 line:-1 align:center
Next up is Migration.


113
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,676 line:-1
There are two parts to migration:


114
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.247 line:-2 align:center
rewriting your existing ClockKit
complication code in WidgetKit;


115
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.617 line:-2 align:center
and providing a mapping
to let the system know how to upgrade


116
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,554 line:-2
your complications people have set
on their watch faces.


117
00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:04.925 line:-2 align:center
When you adopt WidgetKit the system
will stop asking your ClockKit data source


118
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:10,264 line:-2
for new content and show only your new
complications in the face editing picker.


119
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,867 line:-2
As well as bringing
WidgetKit to the watch,


120
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:18,572 line:-2
watchOS 9 has updated every face
to support rich complications,


121
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,909 line:-2
which allowed us to dramatically reduce
the number of complication families


122
00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:25.445 line:-1 align:center
from 12 to only 4.


123
00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.916 line:-2 align:center
Rectangular and Corner
map directly across


124
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,486 line:-2
to accessoryRectangular
and accessoryCorner.


125
00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:35.622 line:-2 align:center
All three graphic Circular
styled ClockKit families


126
00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:39.860 line:-2 align:center
are now a single
accessoryCircular WidgetKit family.


127
00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:44.398 line:-2 align:center
And the accessoryInline family
is used where the old utilitarianSmallFlat


128
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,334 line:-1
or utilitarianLarge used to be.


129
00:07:48.836 --> 00:07:52.139 line:-2 align:center
And many places that used to be
utilitarianSmall


130
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:56,443 line:-2
have been updated
to use the accessoryCorner family.


131
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,914 line:-2
With WidgetKit, SwiftUI views
and their state driven layout


132
00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:03.317 line:-1 align:center
have replaced ClockKit's templates.


133
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,019 line:-2
WidgetKit still has
familiar timelines and entries.


134
00:08:06.053 --> 00:08:09.590 line:-2 align:center
In fact, they were originally inspired
by ClockKit itself,


135
00:08:09.623 --> 00:08:12.826 line:-2 align:center
which means that your complication
data source will nicely migrate


136
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,730 line:-2
to one of either a static or intent based
WidgetKit configuration.


137
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,968 align:center
Please see the original WidgetKit talk
for more details


138
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,837 align:center
about the types of configurations
WidgetKit supports


139
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,906 line:0
as well as general family support.


140
00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:30.143 line:-2 align:center
We've added one last API to ClockKit
to allow a person's complications


141
00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:33.313 line:-2 align:center
to be migrated by
the system automatically.


142
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,450 line:-2
This allows for your existing
complications that are already


143
00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:40.754 line:-2 align:center
on watch faces to automatically be
upgraded to your new WidgetKit based


144
00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:44.625 line:-2 align:center
complications
without any user interaction.


145
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,793 line:-1
When your app gets updated on a watch,


146
00:08:46.827 --> 00:08:49.496 line:-2 align:center
the Watch Faces will check
for the presence of widgets


147
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,365 line:-1
in your app's bundle.


148
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:55,936 line:-2
If it finds any, it will then launch
your ClockKit complication data source


149
00:08:55.969 --> 00:09:00.140 line:-2 align:center
to generate the migrations
for the existing complications.


150
00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:03.410 line:-2 align:center
From this point forward,
your CLKComplicationDataSource


151
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:07,881 line:-2
will only be run to ask for migrations
when a person receives a shared face


152
00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:10.551 line:-1 align:center
with your ClockKit complications on it.


153
00:09:10.584 --> 00:09:14.855 line:-2 align:center
The system will ask for your migrations
every time a new face is shared,


154
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:18.592 line:-2 align:center
so for a consistent experience you should
keep your migrations consistent.

Once you've finished creating
your beautiful WidgetKit complications,


156
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,065 line:-2
you can add the new property,
widgetMigrator,


157
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:29,136 line:-2
to provide the object that conforms
to the new Migrator protocol.


158
00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:33.473 line:-2 align:center
Be that your complication data source
itself or some other type you provide.


159
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:39,213 line:-2
The CLKComplication WidgetMigrator
protocol has a single function


160
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:43,150 line:-2
to provide to the watch faces
widget migration configurations


161
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:47,321 line:-1
from existing CLKComplicationDescriptors.


162
00:09:47.354 --> 00:09:50.123 line:-2 align:center
The most straightforward way
to adopt the new API


163
00:09:50.157 --> 00:09:53.660 line:-2 align:center
is to have your data source conform
to the new Migrator protocol.


164
00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:58.632 line:-2 align:center
If your WidgetKit complication
uses the static configuration,


165
00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:02.569 line:-2 align:center
you provide a static migration
configuration.


166
00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:04.838 line:-2 align:center
And there's an equivalent
migration configuration


167
00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:08.275 line:-2 align:center
if you use intents
in your widget complication.


168
00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:12.045 line:-2 align:center
Note that if you provide intent based
migration configurations,


169
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,716 line:-2
you will need to also include your intent
definitions in your watch app


170
00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:17.651 line:-1 align:center
as well as your widget extensions,


171
00:10:17.684 --> 00:10:20.554 line:-2 align:center
so you can create your intent objects
in both places.


172
00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:25.292 line:-2 align:center
WidgetKit enables new and creative ways
to make complications for the watch,


173
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,161 line:-2
while dramatically simplifying
the experience.


174
00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:30.430 line:-1 align:center
Thanks for watching.
