Hi, my name is Vincenzo,


4
00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.048 line:-2 align:center
and I'm a type designer
on the Apple Design Team.


5
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,185 line:-2
I'm part of the group responsible
for the design and expansion


6
00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:21.255 line:-2 align:center
of many of the font families
used in our platforms.


7
00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.558 line:-2 align:center
We focus on making functional
and expressive fonts


8
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,594 line:-2
that are essential
in enabling great typography.


9
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,531 line:-2
I'm here to share some awesome
updates on San Francisco


10
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,934 line:-2
and tell you about all the latest
additions to the system fonts.


11
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,604 line:-2
We'll start with an overview
of the San Francisco family of fonts.


12
00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:40.040 line:-2 align:center
I'll take you through
the various available families,


13
00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.776 line:-1 align:center
styles, and Optical Sizes.


14
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.079 line:-2 align:center
Then I'll introduce
the new width styles in SF Pro:


15
00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:48.515 line:-1 align:center
Condensed, Compressed, and Expanded.


16
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:52,219 line:-2
I'll also share a few examples
of how and why to choose these styles


17
00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.855 line:-1 align:center
while designing User Interfaces.


18
00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.224 line:-2 align:center
And to wrap up,
I'll talk about how we're bringing


19
00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:00.928 line:-2 align:center
many of the features of San Francisco
to other writing systems,


20
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:04,531 line:-2
introducing SF Arabic
and SF Arabic Rounded.


21
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,200 line:-1
Let's jump right in,


22
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,303 line:-2
starting with a quick overview
of San Francisco.


23
00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:12.706 line:-2 align:center
San Francisco is a functional
and versatile family of fonts


24
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,009 line:-2
designed by Apple
and used throughout our platforms.


25
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,612 line:-2
Over the years San Francisco
has grown in parallel


26
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,248 line:-2
with an eco-system of products
and experiences,


27
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,417 line:-1
providing new styles and families


28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,820 line:-2
capable of adapting
to the various needs of UI design.


29
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:30,057 line:-2
Today San Francisco includes
different font families


30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,492 line:-1
which share a common visual language


31
00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:36.029 line:-2 align:center
but with unique features designed
specifically for different environments


32
00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:39.533 line:-2 align:center
and applications,
such as SF Pro and SF Pro Rounded,


33
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,669 line:-2
the main system fonts
used in many of our platforms,


34
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:47,107 line:-1
like iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS.


35
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,643 line:-1
SF Compact and SF Compact Rounded,


36
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:55,148 line:-2
a variation of San Francisco optimized
for narrow columns and small point sizes,


37
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,252 line:-1
also the default system fonts in watchOS.


38
00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:01.221 line:-2 align:center
And SF Mono,
the monospaced SF:


39
00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:05.626 line:-2 align:center
used in coding environments
like Xcode and Swift Playgrounds.


40
00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.363 line:-2 align:center
All of these font families, together,
provide great functionality


41
00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.031 line:-1 align:center
and range of expression


42
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,968 line:-2
that allows text to be rendered
in a variety of contexts.


43
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:18.872 line:-2 align:center
Most SF families come with
a comprehensive palette of weights,


44
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,542 line:-1
spanning from Ultralight to Black,


45
00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.610 line:-1 align:center
providing enough stylistic variation


46
00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:27.147 line:-2 align:center
to create emphasis
and typographic hierarchies.


47
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,851 line:-2
Also, most of the font families come
with Optical Sizes,


48
00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:34.221 line:-2 align:center
allowing the fonts to automatically adjust
certain design features


49
00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:37.024 line:-1 align:center
based on the point size of text.


50
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:41,895 line:-2
For example, moving the dot on top of
the "i" further away from the base shape,


51
00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:45.899 line:-2 align:center
or opening up
the apertures of certain glyphs,


52
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:50,671 line:-2
as well as progressively tracking out text
at smaller point sizes.


53
00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:55.342 line:-2 align:center
All of these adjustments optimize
the fonts generating unique designs


54
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,744 line:-1
to fit different point sizes,


55
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,681 line:-1
for both Display and Text typesetting,


56
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:05,485 line:-2
typographic terms used in reference
to Large and Small text.


57
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,223 line:-2
The San Francisco fonts offer control
and flexibility


58
00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:14.928 line:-2 align:center
to render clear and legible interfaces
consistently across all Apple platforms.


59
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,197 line:-1
These are some of the highlights of SF,


60
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,732 align:center
but there's so much more.


61
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:22,135 align:center
If you want to dive deeper
into Optical Sizes, Variable fonts,


62
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,671 line:0
and Dynamic Type,
I encourage you to check out


63
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:29,877 align:center
Loïc and Jiang's session "The details
of UI typography" from WWDC 2020.


64
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,380 line:-2
Now, today we're going to be focusing
on SF Pro,


65
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:37,084 line:-2
which is already an incredible tool
to design User Interfaces.


66
00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:41.788 line:-2 align:center
However, while weights and optical sizes
already cover many designers' needs,


67
00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:44.491 line:-1 align:center
we identified a set of specific tasks


68
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:47,928 line:-2
that couldn't be fulfilled by
just Weight and Optical axes.


69
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,297 line:-1
For instance, in the Photos app,


70
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.368 line:-2 align:center
where we expanded the stylistic variations
of the Titles in Memories.


71
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:59,106 line:-2
Or in News, where SF serves
as the editorial voice in headlines,


72
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,376 line:-2
with expressive
and space-efficient styles.


73
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,246 line:-2
And lastly, in Maps,
where providing more stylistic options


74
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.383 line:-2 align:center
increased typographic contrast
and legibility.


75
00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.753 line:-2 align:center
So we further expanded
the capabilities of SF


76
00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:15.255 line:-1 align:center
by designing a new axis.


77
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,325 line:-2
With Weights and Optical Sizes
already available,


78
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,896 line:-2
adding a Width axis was the natural
evolution of SF:


79
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,034 line:-2
Joining the Regular Width
we have three more styles:


80
00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:30.237 line:-2 align:center
Condensed,
narrow and space-efficient;


81
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,474 line:-2
Compressed, the most compact
style currently available in SF;


82
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:39,213 line:-2
and last but not least, on
the other end of the spectrum, Expanded.


83
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,982 line:-2
These are all the new available Widths
in SF,


84
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,117 line:-1
which in combination with all the Weights,


85
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,687 line:-1
add a tremendous amount of options,


86
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.556 line:-2 align:center
bringing a whole set of new voices
and functionalities


87
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,626 line:-2
to accommodate a broad range
of applications.


88
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:56,864 line:-2
Some of these styles are more neutral;
others are more expressive.


89
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,832 line:-2
Every style is functional
in its own right,


90
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:03,270 line:-2
but depending on the design intent,
some will perform better than others.


91
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.839 line:-1 align:center
There are no absolute rules in typography,


92
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:09,076 line:-2
but you can expect the styles that
gravitate towards the center


93
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,713 line:-2
of the stylistic map of SF
to have a more neutral voice,


94
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,449 line:-2
while the styles
around the perimeter of the map,


95
00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.552 line:-2 align:center
which feature more extreme Weight
and Width proportions,


96
00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:21.722 line:-2 align:center
to be more expressive,
have a stronger voice,


97
00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:25.592 line:-2 align:center
attributes that can be useful
if you want to draw people's attention


98
00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:27.761 line:-1 align:center
towards a certain area of the UI


99
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,497 line:-1
or strengthen a typographic hierarchy.


100
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:34,101 line:-2
Let's explore the shared and unique
features of these styles


101
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,537 line:-2
and learn how to make
more informed decisions


102
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,107 line:-2
during the process of choosing
and pairing fonts.


103
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,711 line:-2
First things first, all the styles provide
the same language support


104
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,181 line:-2
and can be used to typeset
most of the languages


105
00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:51.285 line:-2 align:center
which use the Latin script,
from English to Vietnamese.


106
00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:56.290 line:-2 align:center
But also Greek and languages
based on the Cyrillic writing system.


107
00:05:56,323 --> 00:06:01,261 line:-2
Something else that all the styles
have in common is the vertical proportions


108
00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:06.466 line:-2 align:center
so that they can be used without any
visual scale discrepancies across Weight.


109
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,538 line:-2
A feature that makes swapping
or mixing fonts predictable and easy,


110
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:16,677 line:-2
so when using different Width styles,
the focus is solely on the Width itself.


111
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.214 line:-2 align:center
In fact, only the horizontal proportions
of the glyphs change


112
00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:23.083 line:-2 align:center
and of course, as a byproduct,
the line length.


113
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:27,120 line:-2
The progressively narrower proportions
highlight a defining aspect


114
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,156 line:-1
that differs between the styles,


115
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:32.826 line:-2 align:center
which is the relationship between
the stem thickness of each style, which–


116
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,597 line:-2
albeit some optical adjustments–
remains fairly consistent.


117
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.199 line:-2 align:center
Instead, the negative area
inside the glyphs,


118
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:41.235 line:-1 align:center
which has a much more dramatic shift,


119
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:45,305 line:-2
becomes much tighter or wider
depending on the Width style.


120
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:49,042 line:-2
This balance has stylistic
and functional implications


121
00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:53.347 line:-2 align:center
in regards to the legibility of a font,
but also the personality.


122
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.017 line:-2 align:center
So here are some considerations
regarding each style.


123
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.554 line:-2 align:center
I'm sure it doesn't come as a surprise
that the Regular Width


124
00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.757 line:-2 align:center
is the most ubiquitous
and versatile style.


125
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,794 line:-2
It features standard proportions,
making text easy to read.


126
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:11,598 line:-2
You can stick to the Regular Width
when the functionalities offered


127
00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:14.034 line:-1 align:center
by the other Widths are not necessary.


128
00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:18.038 line:-2 align:center
Condensed, while looking narrower
compared to the Regular style,


129
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:20.274 line:-1 align:center
still features a comfortable Width,


130
00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:25.045 line:-2 align:center
allowing itself to be used to fit
more text without being overly present.


131
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,615 line:-2
Compressed features
very dense proportions,


132
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:33,320 line:-2
with flat-sided shapes, which allow
the design to become much tighter,


133
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,589 line:-1
making it very space-efficient


134
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,426 line:-2
but also graphical and
ideal as a Display style.


135
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.528 line:-1 align:center
And lastly, Expanded,


136
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,931 line:-1
with a striking loose and open appearance


137
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,133 line:-1
that can find use in Display typesetting


138
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,269 line:-2
but also smaller labels,
and secondary content.


139
00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:52.539 line:-2 align:center
We can see them in action,
typesetting the same text


140
00:07:52.573 --> 00:07:54.842 line:-2 align:center
using the same Weight
but different Widths,


141
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:59,246 line:-2
calls attention to one of the most obvious
use cases for these new styles,


142
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,748 line:-1
which is space-efficiency.


143
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:06,954 line:-2
In fact, we can notice how tighter
or wider SF looks at the same point size.


144
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,657 line:-2
But also how we can typeset
Condensed or Compressed much larger


145
00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:12.860 line:-2 align:center
while still fitting in
the same line length,


146
00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:16.897 line:-2 align:center
which is very useful when
dealing with titles and headlines.


147
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.700 line:-1 align:center
But it's not only about Display sizes.


148
00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:24.338 line:-2 align:center
In fact, the Width styles can
help control longer passages of text,


149
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,708 line:-2
providing the ability
to fit more characters per line,


150
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:31.745 line:-2 align:center
achieving a more ideal and comfortable
reading experience for narrow columns.


151
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,348 line:-2
or just shortening
or lengthening a paragraph,


152
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,518 line:-1
for filling or freeing space in a layout.


153
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:41,622 line:-2
However, this example highlights
also how the Compressed style,


154
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,458 line:-2
while still functional
for small single lines,


155
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:48,896 line:-2
might be too tight for longer
passages of text, like you see here.


156
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:54,201 line:-2
So always consider legibility
when opting for a non-Regular Width.


157
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,104 line:-2
Now that we've seen the main features
of these new styles,


158
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,907 line:-2
let me walk you through a few examples
of how they've helped us


159
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,676 line:-2
improve and expand
the typography in our apps.


160
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,613 line:-2
Let's start with Photos,
where the new range of Widths,


161
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,650 line:-2
joined other styles
bringing even more visual interest


162
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,852 line:-1
in the Titles of Memories


163
00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.155 line:-2 align:center
with text treatments that celebrate
and elevate the content


164
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,224 line:-1
from the rest of the UI.


165
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:20,994 line:-2
Taking a closer look,
we can see that the difference in scale


166
00:09:21.028 --> 00:09:24.464 line:-2 align:center
takes care of establishing
the typographic hierarchy,


167
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:28,101 line:-2
telling us clearly
which is the primary piece of information


168
00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:31.238 line:-1 align:center
and which is the secondary.


169
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:35,542 line:-2
Two contrasting Width styles,
like Compressed and Expanded,


170
00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:40.080 line:-2 align:center
take on the job of making the text
more unique and visually impactful.


171
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:44,418 line:-2
Pairing the wide and condensed styles
of SF with different weights


172
00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:48.322 line:-2 align:center
can allow for a near-endless variety
of font pairings.


173
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,458 line:-2
For instance, you can decide
to stick to just one Width style–


174
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,193 line:-1
Expanded in this case–


175
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:57,097 line:-2
and use contrasting Weights,
like Black and Light.


176
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.235 line:-2 align:center
Or you can pick a single Weight
and use different contrasting Widths,


177
00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:03.837 line:-1 align:center
like Expanded and Compressed.


178
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:08,642 line:-2
You can also combine both approaches
by mixing opposite Width and Weight,


179
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,712 line:-1
for an even more decided contrast.


180
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,481 line:-2
Together with the other
San Francisco families,


181
00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:17.751 line:-1 align:center
like SF Pro Rounded, SF Mono,


182
00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.888 line:-2 align:center
and also New York,
the serif system font,


183
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:25,692 line:-2
the new Width styles open
a world of possible combinations.


184
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:30,831 line:-2
In News, in addition to complementing
the editorial context of the app,


185
00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:35.502 line:-2 align:center
the Width styles provided
extra flexibility and practicality,


186
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:36,803 line:-1
like in this example,


187
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:41,742 line:-2
where using Condensed allows a long
Headline to be more space-efficient,


188
00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:44.611 line:-1 align:center
wrapping into four lines instead of five,


189
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,680 line:-1
or even tighter, with Compressed,


190
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,316 line:-2
which brings the title down
to three lines.


191
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,718 line:-2
Opening up quite a bit of real estate
in the layout,


192
00:10:51.752 --> 00:10:55.956 line:-2 align:center
as well as making the Title stand up,
giving it more personality.


193
00:10:55,989 --> 00:11:00,127 line:-2
Notice also how the Expanded Widths,
used to contrast the Headline,


194
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,130 line:-1
feel at home in captions and bylines.


195
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:08,635 line:-2
We can see another specific but very
interesting use case for Expanded in Maps,


196
00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:11.505 line:-2 align:center
where the wide horizontal proportions
of this style


197
00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:13.507 line:-1 align:center
paired with loose tracking


198
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,377 line:-2
work perfectly when used to represent
large geographical areas,


199
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,446 line:-1
like mountain ranges.


200
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,683 line:-2
But of course,
cartography's not just about mountains.


201
00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:28.355 line:-2 align:center
In fact, Maps adopted other Widths of SF
to create a rich typographic system,


202
00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:30.791 line:-1 align:center
with styles coherent between each other


203
00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:33.493 line:-1 align:center
but also diverse and contrasting,


204
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,297 line:-2
making it easier to read
and tell apart all kinds of labels:


205
00:11:37.331 --> 00:11:40.801 line:-2 align:center
such as roads,
countries, continents, et cetera.


206
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,137 line:-2
While, in most cases,
two or three styles are more than enough


207
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,440 line:-1
to design an effective hierarchy,


208
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:49,476 line:-2
this is a great demonstration
of how SF Pro can support


209
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,412 line:-1
even the most elaborate graphic systems.


210
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:57,284 line:-2
And those are just a few examples of how
to take advantage of the new Width styles.


211
00:11:57.317 --> 00:12:00.387 line:-2 align:center
The expanded functionality
and range of expression


212
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,891 line:-2
make SF Pro an even more powerful
communication tool.


213
00:12:03.924 --> 00:12:08.262 line:-2 align:center
However, with great typographic power,
comes great responsibility.


214
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:12,766 line:-2
Remember that fonts are design tools that
are meant to make interfaces beautiful,


215
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,103 line:-2
but most importantly
legible and accessible.


216
00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:18.438 line:-2 align:center
Let's do a quick recap
with some of the considerations made


217
00:12:18.472 --> 00:12:22.476 line:-2 align:center
on the new Compressed,
Condensed, and Expanded styles.


218
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:26,580 line:-2
First and foremost, the new Width styles
unlock an unprecedented level of control


219
00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:31.118 line:-2 align:center
in your layouts, giving you the ability
to make text wider or tighter


220
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:36,056 line:-2
to efficiently design and arrange
typographic elements in your apps.


221
00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:39.026 line:-2 align:center
Also,
in addition to Weight, Size, and Color,


222
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,029 line:-2
the new Width styles provide
more stylistic options


223
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:46,700 line:-2
to create even more clear
and precise typographic hierarchies.


224
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,903 line:-2
The fonts with more extreme
Weight and Width proportions


225
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:54,208 line:-2
provide expressive styles that work great
at Display point sizes,


226
00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:58.345 line:-2 align:center
to elevate titles and headlines
from the rest of the UI.


227
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:02,015 line:-2
All the SF Pro fonts cover most languages
using the Latin,


228
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,017 line:-1
Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets.


229
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:07,287 line:-2
However, if localization is
an essential aspect of your app


230
00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:09.923 line:-2 align:center
and you're looking to provide
a consistent experience


231
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,859 line:-1
across multiple writing systems,


232
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,994 line:-1
other than the aforementioned ones,


233
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,963 line:-1
make sure you have a fallback plan,


234
00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:20.634 line:-2 align:center
by identifying alternative solutions
that can help you localize your app.


235
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:24,805 line:-2
Okay, so we did go through many
of the new features of the system font,


236
00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:26.440 line:-1 align:center
but we're not done yet.


237
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,910 line:-2
There is another way
the family is expanding.


238
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,113 line:-1
At Apple, we design for a global audience.


239
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,416 line:-2
Our devices are used by people
from all around the world


240
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,553 line:-2
who read and write different scripts
and languages.


241
00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:42.356 line:-2 align:center
Fonts play a huge role
in designing interfaces


242
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,125 line:-2
that are both stylistically
and functionally consistent


243
00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.528 line:-1 align:center
across multiple languages,


244
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:51,899 line:-2
providing integrity to the many
graphical elements featuring text.


245
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,834 line:-1
And text is everywhere,


246
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:58,172 line:-2
like in the Large Titles and Table Rows
in these screens,


247
00:13:58.205 --> 00:14:00.507 line:-1 align:center
but also in Buttons,


248
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,544 line:-1
Platters, Icon labels.


249
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:06,213 line:-1
Text is in Widgets, Keyboards,


250
00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:08.248 line:-1 align:center
Tab bars and many more,


251
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:11,618 line:-1
in many more languages!


252
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:14,221 line:-2
One area where
we incorporate these principles


253
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:17,691 line:-2
and we can achieve
the highest level of consistency


254
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,761 line:-2
is with experiences
that are self-contained


255
00:14:20.794 --> 00:14:24.765 line:-2 align:center
and can use fonts we design
for the ultimate localized experience,


256
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:28,635 line:-2
allowing your screensaver on the Mac
to greet you in Japanese


257
00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:32.139 line:-2 align:center
and many other languages with
the iconic "hello" cursive style.


258
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,876 line:-2
or the iPhone to display the time
using Arabic,


259
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,679 line:-1
Arabic-Indic, or Devanagari numerals


260
00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:41.682 line:-1 align:center
with the same consistent typeface.


261
00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.650 line:-1 align:center
Or on the Typograph watch-face,


262
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:46,353 line:-2
which features
five different numeral sets,


263
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,122 line:-1
including the new Chinese numerals.


264
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:53,427 line:-2
We want to bring the same level
of consistency to the system fonts,


265
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.830 line:-2 align:center
which have to work
for a much broader range of applications.


266
00:14:56,864 --> 00:15:00,868 line:-2
This requires extending
the linguistic coverage of San Francisco


267
00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:03.971 line:-2 align:center
and allowing other writing systems
to benefit from features


268
00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:06.340 line:-1 align:center
like Weights and Optical Sizes,


269
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,809 line:-2
providing a reading experience that is,
at the same time,


270
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,844 line:-1
visually engaging and comfortable,


271
00:15:10.878 --> 00:15:13.981 line:-2 align:center
for every script and language,
in any of our platforms.


272
00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:16.683 line:-1 align:center
This expansion started last year


273
00:15:16.717 --> 00:15:19.553 line:-2 align:center
when we introduced
the new Arabic system font,


274
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,321 line:-1
SF Arabic.


275
00:15:21.355 --> 00:15:24.224 line:-2 align:center
We designed SF Arabic
to seamlessly integrate


276
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,094 line:-2
with the rest
of the San Francisco families.


277
00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:30.964 line:-2 align:center
SF Arabic is a contemporary interpretation
of the Naskh style


278
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:34,001 line:-1
with a rational and flexible design,


279
00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:38.172 line:-2 align:center
and it's the latest writing system,
after Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic,


280
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:41,074 line:-2
to benefit from the most advanced
font technologies,


281
00:15:41.108 --> 00:15:43.944 line:-1 align:center
available on the Apple platforms.


282
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,313 line:-1
Like the other San Francisco families,


283
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,049 line:-1
it features the full gamut of weights,


284
00:15:49.082 --> 00:15:51.351 line:-1 align:center
Ultralight through Black,


285
00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:55.355 line:-2 align:center
and each of the nine weights has been
carefully designed to fit and combine


286
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:59.226 line:-2 align:center
with the other scripts
and languages supported in SF.


287
00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:03.163 line:-1 align:center
Also, SF Arabic comes with Optical Sizes


288
00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:06.233 line:-2 align:center
tailored specifically
for the Arabic script.


289
00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:09.603 line:-2 align:center
Allowing the fonts to automatically adjust
the stroke contrast


290
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,972 line:-1
and terminals and spacing,


291
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:16,376 line:-2
adapting and scaling the design
between Display and Text sizes.


292
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.380 line:-2 align:center
The Text styles are fine-tuned
for high Legibility and familiarity,


293
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:23,984 line:-2
featuring a higher stroke contrast
and wider spacing.


294
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:28,555 line:-2
While the Display styles morph into
a design with a simpler geometry,


295
00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:32.359 line:-2 align:center
blending with the clean
and contemporary look of San Francisco.


296
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:35,596 line:-2
And all of this is automatically
and dynamically taken care of


297
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:37.064 line:-1 align:center
by the system,


298
00:16:37.097 --> 00:16:41.301 line:-2 align:center
enabling a comfortable
reading experience at all sizes.


299
00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:44.505 line:-2 align:center
Like the Latin,
and Cyrillic writing systems,


300
00:16:44.538 --> 00:16:47.274 line:-1 align:center
the Arabic script is highly multilingual


301
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,544 line:-2
and is used to write
not only the Arabic language,


302
00:16:50.577 --> 00:16:52.446 line:-1 align:center
but also a variety of other languages,


303
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,548 line:-1
such as Persian, Pashto,


304
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:59,353 line:-2
Sindhi, and many more,
all supported by SF Arabic.


305
00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:02.856 line:-2 align:center
Numerous vocalization,
tone, and poetic marks,


306
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,327 line:-2
extended vowel signs, honorifics,
and Quranic annotations


307
00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:12.132 line:-2 align:center
complete the extensive character set
supported in SF Arabic.


308
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,235 line:-2
And I'm excited to announce
that this year we're introducing


309
00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:18.172 line:-1 align:center
a new member to the San Francisco family,


310
00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:20.307 line:-1 align:center
SF Arabic Rounded.


311
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.744 line:-2 align:center
Which packs the same great features
of SF Arabic,


312
00:17:23.777 --> 00:17:29.116 line:-2 align:center
coming with a full range of Weights,
and Optical Sizes.


313
00:17:29.149 --> 00:17:32.920 line:-2 align:center
The new Rounded design
