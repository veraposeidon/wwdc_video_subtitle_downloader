8
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,655 line:-1
Miranda: In this video,
Elana and I will be diving into


9
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:26,193 line:-1
how to enhance collaboration
with Messages in your app.


10
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:31,865 line:-1
I'll start with an introduction
of what the feature is.


11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,936 line:-1
You'll learn how to prepare
to adopt this feature,


12
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,605 line:-1
and how to tie Messages
into the process


13
00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:42.676 line:-1 position:50%
to start a collaboration.


14
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,512 line:-1
Elana will explain
how to add collaboration


15
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:49,616 line:-1
with Messages UI to your app,


16
00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:52.552 line:-1 position:50%
and finally she will discuss
how to keep up to date


17
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:56,523 line:-1
when the collaboration
is updated.


18
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:02,296 line:-1
First, let me introduce
collaboration with Messages!


19
00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:07.768 line:-1 position:50%
In iOS 16 and macOS Ventura,
we've added a new and easy way


20
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:13,907 line:-1
to improve communication between
people who are collaborating.


21
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:17.711 line:-1 position:50%
Collaborators are able to tie
a document to conversations


22
00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:21.815 line:-1 position:50%
by sharing via Messages.


23
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:25.052 line:-1 position:50%
Collaboration activity
is surfaced in Messages


24
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:31,325 line:-1
conversations and in
ongoing FaceTime calls.


25
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,227 line:-1
A customizable
Collaboration popover


26
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:38,065 line:-1
is also provided to your app
to manage details


27
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:44,638 line:-1
of the collaboration and connect
to the Messages conversation.


28
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,874 line:-1
This builds on technologies
that you are already using,


29
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:52,379 line:-1
such as the share sheet
and drag and drop.


30
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,550 line:-1
Next, I'll go over the types of
collaboration infrastructures


31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,653 line:-1
we support,
and how to tie each of those


32
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:02,856 line:-1
to Messages collaboration.


33
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:07,561 line:-1
We support three types of
collaboration infrastructures:


34
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:11,164 line:-1
CloudKit, iCloud Drive,
and whatever custom


35
00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:15.635 line:-1 position:50%
collaboration infrastructure
you may be using today!


36
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,138 line:-1
In this video,
I'll mainly focus


37
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,142 line:-1
on the CloudKit
and iCloud Drive cases.


38
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,278 line:0
If you are using
a custom infrastructure,


39
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:29,383 position:50%
watch the "Integrate your custom
collaboration app with Messages"


40
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:33,286 position:50%
video for more details.


41
00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:36.490 line:-1 position:50%
If you use CloudKit-based
collaboration,


42
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,860 line:-1
we've provided a new API
to create an object


43
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.264 line:-1 position:50%
that the system
can recognize for collaboration.


44
00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:47.534 line:-1 position:50%
This is based off
the macOS Sierra API


45
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:52,639 line:-1
to start or manage a share
with NSSharingService.


46
00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.375 line:-1 position:50%
Once you have
the collaboration object,


47
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,612 line:-1
identify where in the app
you are showing UI


48
00:02:58.612 --> 00:03:02.149 line:-1 position:50%
to start or manage the share.


49
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.484 line:-1 position:50%
You need to update
to the new API


50
00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.454 line:-1 position:50%
to enhance your
collaboration with Messages,


51
00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:13.894 line:-1 position:50%
as we will deprecate
the existing AppKit API.


52
00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:19.299 line:-1 position:50%
The new collaboration object API
uses NSItemProvider.


53
00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.136 line:-1 position:50%
NSItemProvider is used
by system services


54
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:28,308 line:-1
to transport your app's data to
other processes on the system.


55
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,044 line:-1
The provider requires
either the CKShare


56
00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:35.382 line:-1 position:50%
for the collaboration item,
or a preparation handler


57
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,920 line:-1
to create a CKShare
when collaboration starts.


58
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,723 line:-1
Your app's CKContainer
is also required.


59
00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:48.328 line:-1 position:50%
And finally, provide a
CKAllowedSharingOptions object


60
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,698 line:-1
representing the access
and permissions options


61
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,634 line:-1
for the collaboration.


62
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,204 line:-1
The values of the options
are the same as the


63
00:03:57.204 --> 00:04:02.342 line:-1 position:50%
NSCloudKitSharingServiceOptions
which were previously requested


64
00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:05.378 line:-1 position:50%
from
NSCloudSharingServiceDelegate


65
00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:08.048 line:-1 position:50%
methods.


66
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:11,051 line:-1
Here's a brief overview
of what it looks like to create


67
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:15.622 line:-1 position:50%
a CloudKit collaboration object.


68
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:19,126 line:-1
If the collaboration
is being started and you pass in


69
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,995 line:-1
a preparation handler,
you need to both


70
00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:28.535 line:-1 position:50%
create the share and save it
to the server in the handler.


71
00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:35.575 line:-1 position:50%
If it's already started, just
pass in the associated share.


72
00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:39.446 line:-1 position:50%
The CKAllowedSharingOptions
instance being registered


73
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,782 line:-1
is using
a static standard property


74
00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:46.853 line:-1 position:50%
which returns the default set
of allowed options.


75
00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:51.158 line:-1 position:50%
CloudKit adopters can use that
or create a custom instance


76
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:55,862 line:-1
of the class for a restricted
set of allowed options.


77
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:02,235 line:-1
For those of you who might be
interested in adopting CloudKit,


78
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,805 line:-1
CloudKit lets you use iCloud
as your app's database


79
00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:09.276 line:-1 position:50%
without writing your own
server code.


80
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:12,412 line:-1
You will also get a built-in
method of sharing parts


81
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,916 line:-1
of that data
with other iCloud users.


82
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:22,389 line:0
For more details, watch the
"What's new in CloudKit" video.


83
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,591 line:-1
If you're using iCloud Drive,


84
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:29,062 line:-1
your object for collaboration
is simply your file URL --


85
00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:33.166 line:-1 position:50%
we'll do all the work
to recognize it!


86
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,336 line:-1
Once you have that,
identify the entry points


87
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,140 line:-1
to start or manage collaboration
in your app


88
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:46,313 line:-1
and prepare to replace them with
the new and improved versions.


89
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,349 line:-1
For custom collaboration
infrastructures,


90
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:54,988 line:-1
your collaboration object is
called SWCollaborationMetadata,


91
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:59,192 line:-1
wrapped in new
NSItemProvider API.


92
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,929 line:-1
Watch the "Integrate your custom
collaboration app with Messages"


93
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,733 line:-1
video for details on
how to use this API


94
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,804 line:-1
to update your collaboration UI.


95
00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:13.039 line:-1 position:50%
Now you're ready to go.


96
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,409 line:-1
Next, initiating
a collaboration.


97
00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.279 line:-1 position:50%
There are two different ways:
through the share sheet


98
00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.049 line:-1 position:50%
in its new collaboration mode,
and through drag and drop


99
00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.852 line:-1 position:50%
to Messages,
either from your app


100
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:31,891 line:-1
or from the Files app on iOS
and Finder on macOS.


101
00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.661 line:-1 position:50%
The new share sheet
collaboration mode


102
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:38,498 line:-1
can be identified
by an indicator in the header,


103
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,635 line:-1
which also provides
a choice between collaboration


104
00:06:41.635 --> 00:06:44.404 line:-1 position:50%
and sending a copy.


105
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,641 line:-1
In order to have collaboration
in the share sheet,


106
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,543 line:-1
give the share sheet
the collaboration object


107
00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:54.481 line:-1 position:50%
you prepared earlier.


108
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,517 line:-1
On macOS,
this collaboration indicator


109
00:06:57.517 --> 00:07:01.788 line:-1 position:50%
is shown in a beautiful
new share popover!


110
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,825 line:-1
The share popover
also includes a title and image


111
00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:09.496 line:-1 position:50%
in the header, plus a row
of conversation suggestions,


112
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:13,600 line:-1
and all the transports
we offered already.


113
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,502 position:50%
For more details about this,


114
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:20,874 line:0
watch the WWDC22
"What's new in AppKit" video.


115
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:24,978 line:-1
On iOS and Mac Catalyst,
show the share sheet using


116
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,648 line:-1
the UIActivityViewController
class.


117
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:36,456 line:-1
On macOS, show the share popover
using NSSharingServicePicker.


118
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,694 line:-1
Pass the collaboration object
to UIActivityViewController


119
00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:47.300 line:-1 position:50%
as an activity item to present
it with collaboration enabled.


120
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,071 line:-1
And similarly, initialize
NSSharingServicePicker


121
00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:54.140 line:-1 position:50%
with the collaboration object
to show it


122
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,811 line:-1
with collaboration enabled.


123
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,448 line:-1
CloudKit adopters
will need to take an extra step


124
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:06,052 line:-1
to provide a title
and image for the headers.


125
00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:12.525 line:-1 position:50%
On iOS, use existing API such
as UIActivityItemsConfiguration


126
00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:16.296 line:-1 position:50%
or UIActivityItemSource
to provide


127
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:23,670 line:-1
an LPLinkMetadata object
with a title and imageProvider.


128
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,108 line:-1
Create your configuration
with your collaboration object,


129
00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:31.611 line:-1 position:50%
then set the metadata provider
to return


130
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:38,318 line:-1
your LPLinkMetadata object
for the item being shared.


131
00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:42.088 line:-1 position:50%
Finally, initialize
UIActivityViewController


132
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,692 line:-1
with that configuration.


133
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,762 line:-1
On macOS,
we have a new API called


134
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:52,332 line:-1
NSPreviewRepresenting
ActivityItem


135
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,268 line:-1
for providing
the header metadata.


136
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,336 position:50%
Refer to the


137
00:08:56,336 --> 00:09:00,340 line:0
NSPreviewRepresenting
ActivityItem documentation


138
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,244 line:0
for more details.


139
00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:07.914 line:-1 position:50%
To use NSPreviewRepresenting
ActivityItem,


140
00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:12.519 line:-1 position:50%
first choose your title,
image, and icon.


141
00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:15.588 line:-1 position:50%
The image represents
the item being shared,


142
00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:18.725 line:-1 position:50%
while the icon represents
the source of the item


143
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:24,831 line:-1
being shared --
for example, an app icon.


144
00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:28.401 line:-1 position:50%
Create an NSPreviewRepresenting
ActivityItem


145
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:34.174 line:-1 position:50%
with your collaboration object,
title, image, and icon,


146
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,610 line:-1
and initialize
NSSharingServicePicker


147
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.414 line:-1 position:50%
with that preview item.


148
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,652 line:-1
On an exciting note,
the new SwiftUI ShareLink API


149
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:50,256 line:-1
for the share sheet will also
support collaboration mode!


150
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,760 line:-1
To adopt, the item you are
sharing must be represented


151
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,066 line:-1
by Transferable, a new protocol
for sharing and data transfer.


152
00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:03.770 line:-1 position:50%
CloudKit adopters provide
the share, container,


153
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,041 line:-1
and options through
a CKShareTransferRepresentation


154
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:11.444 line:-1 position:50%
returned by your
Transferable item.


155
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,081 position:50%
For more details,
watch the "Meet Transferable"


156
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:22,155 line:0
and WWDC22
"What's new in SwiftUI" videos.


157
00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:25.725 line:-1 position:50%
Here's an example of how
a CloudKit adopter like Notes


158
00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:32.065 line:-1 position:50%
would create a transferable
object to share with ShareLink.


159
00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:38.304 line:-1 position:50%
The note provides a
CKShareTransferRepresentation,


160
00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:41.608 line:-1 position:50%
which is constructed either
as its existing value


161
00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:45.712 line:-1 position:50%
with an existing CKShare,
CKContainer,


162
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:49,716 line:-1
and CKAllowedSharingOptions
value,


163
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:54,120 line:-1
or as its prepareShare value
with a CKContainer,


164
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,125 line:-1
CKAllowedSharingOptions value,
and a preparation handler


165
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:06,399 line:-1
to create and save a CKShare
for the collaboration object.


166
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,537 line:-1
For iCloud Drive adopters,
your file URL


167
00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:15.742 line:-1 position:50%
is the Transferable object which
you share through ShareLink.


168
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:19,279 line:-1
If you have a custom
collaboration infrastructure,


169
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,483 line:-1
watch the "Integrate your custom
collaboration app with Messages"


170
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:29,289 line:-1
video for how to return an
SWCollaborationMetadata object


171
00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:33.993 line:-1 position:50%
from your transferable object.


172
00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:36.796 line:-1 position:50%
Once you have
your Transferable object,


173
00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:38.998 line:-1 position:50%
pass it
to the ShareLink initializer


174
00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:41.367 line:-1 position:50%
as the item to share.


175
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,003 line:-1
At the same time,
pass in a preview


176
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:50,977 line:-1
with a title and image to
fill in the share sheet header.


177
00:11:50.977 --> 00:11:52.378 line:-1 position:50%
One notable feature


178
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,281 line:-1
of the share sheet
collaboration mode header


179
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,986 line:-1
is the summary of the access
and permissions options.


180
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:03,256 line:-1
Tapping this summary brings up
a view where collaborators


181
00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:06.459 line:-1 position:50%
choose what access
and permissions options


182
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:11,631 line:-1
to use when collaborating.


183
00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:14.534 line:-1 position:50%
For CloudKit adopters,
this view shows


184
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:19,339 line:-1
the set of options registered
in the collaboration object.


185
00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:21.074 line:-1 position:50%
iCloud Drive adopters


186
00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:25.478 line:-1 position:50%
show the standard set
of iCloud Drive options.


187
00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.880 line:-1 position:50%
If you have a custom
infrastructure,


188
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.085 line:-1 position:50%
watch the "Integrate your custom
collaboration app with Messages"


189
00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:36.189 line:-1 position:50%
video for how to specify
your custom options


190
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:41.094 line:-1 position:50%
and have them
show up in this view.


191
00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:44.097 line:-1 position:50%
There's one more way
to start a collaboration,


192
00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.833 line:-1 position:50%
and that's through
drag and drop.


193
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:51,204 line:-1
A collaborator can simply drag
your document into Messages


194
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:54,507 line:-1
and get the new
collaboration-enabled rich link


195
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,543 line:-1
for the document in Messages.


196
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,179 line:-1
This rich link
provides functionality


197
00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:03.983 line:-1 position:50%
both for collaboration
and sending a copy,


198
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:08,254 line:-1
and for selecting
collaboration options.


199
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,324 line:-1
To adopt, provide your
collaboration object


200
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:18,598 line:-1
through ShareLink on iOS 16
and macOS Ventura.


201
00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:22.368 line:-1 position:50%
And that's how you prepare for
and initiate collaborations


202
00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:24.037 line:-1 position:50%
with Messages.


203
00:13:24.037 --> 00:13:27.040 line:-1 position:50%
Next, I'll hand it
over to Elana,


204
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,710 line:-1
who will talk about taking your
app's collaboration experience


205
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.979 line:-1 position:50%
to the next level.


206
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,681 line:-1
Elana: Thanks, Miranda!


207
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,516 line:-1
Now that you know
how to get started,


208
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,484 line:-1
I'll talk about
how to further integrate


209
00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:42.422 line:-1 position:50%
our collaboration UI
into your app.


210
00:13:42.422 --> 00:13:43.956 line:-1 position:50%
We've added these new features


211
00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:47.193 line:-1 position:50%
to amplify the collaboration
experience.


212
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,763 line:-1
The collaboration button is
placed in your app's navigation


213
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,031 line:-1
and will show the group photo


214
00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:54.367 line:-1 position:50%
of the associated
messages group.


215
00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:56.703 line:-1 position:50%
There is also an active
participant count


216
00:13:56.703 --> 00:13:59.072 line:-1 position:50%
to the right of the button
that will show when others


217
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:02,842 line:-1
are present in the document.


218
00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.044 line:-1 position:50%
When you tap
the collaboration button,


219
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,347 line:-1
the new collaboration
popover appears.


220
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,782 line:-1
The customizable popover


221
00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:12.585 line:-1 position:50%
shows the overview
of the collaboration.


222
00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:15.188 line:-1 position:50%
It also allows users
to initiate communication


223
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,324 line:-1
with other participants
with just one tap.


224
00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:21.961 line:-1 position:50%
This provides them the ability
to work together in real time


225
00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:24.864 line:-1 position:50%
via Messages and FaceTime.


226
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,136 line:-1
These UI elements are all
powered by a single class


227
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:34,240 line:-1
in the SharedWithYou framework:
SWCollaborationView.


228
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,111 line:-1
This view represents the
button view in the navigation.


229
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,679 line:-1
All you need to do
is initialize


230
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,381 line:-1
the SWCollaborationView
and we will take care


231
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,919 line:-1
of the popover layout
and presentation for you.


232
00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:49.422 line:-1 position:50%
To show custom content,
you'll provide a view


233
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,658 line:-1
which will be added
to the popover.


234
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:58,865 line:-1
Now, I'll go over the code to
create the SWCollaborationView.


235
00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:01.367 line:-1 position:50%
Initialize
the SWCollaborationView


236
00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.269 line:-1 position:50%
with an itemProvider.


237
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,504 line:-1
The itemProvider contains


238
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:07,607 line:-1
the CKShare
for CloudKit-based apps,


239
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,143 line:-1
the fileURL
for iCloud Drive-based apps,


240
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,512 line:-1
or the SW Collaboration
metadata


241
00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:16.015 line:-1 position:50%
for custom collaboration
infrastructures.


242
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,520 line:-1
Set the activeParticipantCount
property


243
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.189 line:-1 position:50%
on the collaboration view
to show the number


244
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:27.860 line:-1 position:50%
of active participants
on the document.


245
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,163 line:-1
Then set the contentView
property


246
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,765 line:-1
on the collaborationView
to provide the popover


247
00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:35.535 line:-1 position:50%
with custom content.


248
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,470 line:-1
The ContentView
is what makes the popover


249
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,939 line:-1
completely customizable.


250
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,642 line:-1
This is where you'll add
your own content to give users


251
00:15:42.642 --> 00:15:47.013 line:-1 position:50%
a unique view of what is
going on in the collaboration.


252
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,916 line:-1
For example, in Pages,
the ContentView contains


253
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,951 line:-1
the Current Participants list


254
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,822 line:-1
and the Participant Cursors
toggle.


255
00:15:55.822 --> 00:15:58.591 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let's look at
the "manage" button.


256
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,927 line:-1
For CloudKit
and iCloud Drive adopters,


257
00:16:00.927 --> 00:16:04.030 line:-1 position:50%
this manage button
will bring up the manage UI,


258
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,965 line:-1
where you can add
and remove participants


259
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:08.768 line:-1 position:50%
or change the share settings.


260
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:12,505 line:-1
I'll talk more
about this shortly.


261
00:16:12.505 --> 00:16:15.174 line:-1 position:50%
Customize the provided
button title by setting


262
00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:19.011 line:-1 position:50%
the manageButtonTitle property
on the collaboration view.


263
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:21.080 line:-1 position:50%
If you do not set
this property,


264
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.383 line:-1 position:50%
the title will default
to "Manage Share."


265
00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:27.954 line:-1 position:50%
If your app uses a custom
collaboration infrastructure,


266
00:16:27.954 --> 00:16:31.858 line:-1 position:50%
include your own manage button
in the contentView.


267
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,694 line:-1
One will not be
provided for you.


268
00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:38.231 line:-1 position:50%
On Mac, make sure the button
has a transparent background


269
00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:43.302 line:-1 position:50%
to adhere to Apple design
recommendations.


270
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,073 line:-1
Finally,
create a UIBarButtonItem on iOS


271
00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:49.642 line:-1 position:50%
as shown here,
using the collaborationView


272
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,711 line:-1
as the custom view.


273
00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:54.513 line:-1 position:50%
On Mac,
initialize an NSToolbarItem


274
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,183 line:-1
using a UIBarButtonItem.


275
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,553 line:-1
Then, add the bar button item
or toolbar item


276
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:04,590 line:-1
to the ViewController's
navigationItem.


277
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,626 line:-1
As I mentioned earlier,


278
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,128 line:-1
CloudKit and iCloud Drive
adopters are provided


279
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,131 line:-1
with a button
in the collaboration popover.


280
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,667 line:-1
This enables you to manage
the share in the same way


281
00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:17.169 line:-1 position:50%
you've always been able to.


282
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,772 line:-1
Changes in the provided
manage UI are observable


283
00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:22.341 line:-1 position:50%
by adhering to
the same delegate protocols


284
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,911 line:-1
already used to observe changes:


285
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:27.046 line:-1 position:50%
UICloudSharing
ControllerDelegate


286
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,917 line:-1
and NSCloudSharing
ServiceDelegate.


287
00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:33.753 line:-1 position:50%
Now you have an understanding
of how to integrate


288
00:17:33.753 --> 00:17:38.524 line:-1 position:50%
the new collaboration UI
into your app.


289
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,127 line:-1
Next, I'll go over how
to observe and handle


290
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:44,997 line:-1
updates to collaborations.


291
00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:48.968 line:-1 position:50%
It is critical to know when
a share starts or stops.


292
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:52,838 line:-1
For CloudKit adopters,
we've added a new protocol


293
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,808 line:-1
called CKSystemSharing
UIObserver


294
00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:58.444 line:-1 position:50%
to notify you of just that.


295
00:17:58.444 --> 00:18:01.147 line:-1 position:50%
With this protocol,
you get callbacks corresponding


296
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,350 line:-1
to when your CKShare
is saved or removed


297
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,753 line:-1
without needing
the CloudKit Sharing UI.


298
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,824 line:-1
I'll take you
through some code now.


299
00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:17.163 line:-1 position:50%
Initialize an observer
using the CKContainer.


300
00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:19.999 line:-1 position:50%
On the observer,
define a closure to be executed


301
00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:22.768 line:-1 position:50%
when the CKShare
is saved and assign it


302
00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:28.474 line:-1 position:50%
to the systemSharingUI
DidSaveShareBlock.


303
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,444 line:-1
In the closure, if the Share
was saved correctly,


304
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,212 line:-1
you'll get a success result --


305
00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:35.448 line:-1 position:50%
indicating the share
was started --


306
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,952 line:-1
and an associated
CKShare to work with.


307
00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:42.288 line:-1 position:50%
If the save was unsuccessful,


308
00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:47.593 line:-1 position:50%
you receive a failure result
and the associated error.


309
00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:49.628 line:-1 position:50%
Here is the implementation
of the closure


310
00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:53.699 line:-1 position:50%
for when the document owner
stops sharing.


311
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,368 line:-1
In the success case,


312
00:18:55.368 --> 00:18:59.372 line:-1 position:50%
the CKShare
has successfully been deleted.


313
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:05,177 line:-1
In the failure case, you will
also get the associated error.


314
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,746 line:-1
Starting and stopping shares


315
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,882 line:-1
are not the only changes
you may care about.


316
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:14,120 line:-1
Some changes, you might even
want to bubble up to users.


317
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.156 line:-1 position:50%
We've added API to enable you
to post notices


318
00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:19.959 line:-1 position:50%
summarizing updates
to a collaboration,


319
00:19:19.959 --> 00:19:23.496 line:-1 position:50%
right at the top
of the relevant Messages thread.


320
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,198 line:-1
Collaborators are shown
what the update was


321
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:30,436 line:-1
and who made the change.


322
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:34,373 line:-1
To post a notice, retrieve
the SWCollaborationHighlight,


323
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,208 line:-1
which is a
collaboration-specific


324
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,278 line:-1
type of highlight
in Shared with You.


325
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:43,115 line:-1
Use it to create an
SWCollaborationHighlight event.


326
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:47,253 line:-1
Learn more about SWHighlights
and other SharedWithYou APIs


327
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:51,290 line:-1
in the "Add Shared with You
to your app" video.


328
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,559 line:-1
Watch this video before
beginning your work


329
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,696 line:-1
to adopt notices.


330
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,665 line:-1
I'll talk through posting
different notices


331
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,668 line:-1
using a CloudKit app
as an example.


332
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:06,138 line:-1
If your app uses a custom
collaboration infrastructure,


333
00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:08.674 line:-1 position:50%
view the "Integrate your
custom collaboration app


334
00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:12.278 line:-1 position:50%
with Messages" video
for detailed instructions.


335
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,714 line:-1
To represent a notice,
we've introduced a protocol


336
00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:18.217 line:-1 position:50%
called SWHighlightEvent.


337
00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:21.587 line:-1 position:50%
Highlight events are
initialized with SWHighlights


338
00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:24.857 line:-1 position:50%
retrieved from
the SWHighlightCenter API.


339
00:20:24.857 --> 00:20:28.060 line:-1 position:50%
The supported event types
include a change event


340
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,463 line:-1
for content updates or comments;


341
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:34,600 line:-1
a mention event when a user
is mentioned in a collaboration;


342
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,238 line:-1
a persistence event when content
is moved, renamed, or deleted;


343
00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.706 line:-1 position:50%
and a membership event


344
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:45,277 line:-1
when a participant is added
or removed from a document.


345
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,214 line:-1
Here's an example showing
how to post a change event


346
00:20:48.214 --> 00:20:52.318 line:-1 position:50%
when a collaboration
has been edited.


347
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,386 line:-1
Using the highlight center API,


348
00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:58.324 line:-1 position:50%
retrieve a collaboration
highlight using the CKShare URL.


349
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,660 line:-1
Remember, this CKShare
is one you defined during


350
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.997 line:-1 position:50%
the collaboration initiation,
so your app should have


351
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:09,535 line:-1
this available when
a content change is made.


352
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:12,972 line:-1
Next, create a
HighlightChangeEvent instance.


353
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,640 line:-1
The initializer
takes a highlight,


354
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.343 line:-1 position:50%
and a trigger enum value.


355
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:22,148 line:-1
In this case,
we set the trigger type to edit.


356
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,617 line:-1
Lastly,
post the notice for that event


357
00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:27.987 line:-1 position:50%
to the highlightCenter.


358
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,356 line:-1
The rest of the events
follow a similar format


359
00:21:30.356 --> 00:21:33.058 line:-1 position:50%
with the sole exception
being the mentionEvent,


360
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,560 line:-1
as it requires more information


361
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.330 line:-1 position:50%
to indicate which
user was mentioned.


362
00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.432 line:-1 position:50%
You are able to post
this type of event


363
00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:44.803 line:-1 position:50%
only if your app
supports user mentions.


364
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,339 line:-1
Create the mentionEvent
by passing in the retrieved


365
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:52,845 line:-1
highlight and the handle of the
mentioned CKShare participant.


366
00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:57.650 line:-1 position:50%
This notice will only be shown
to the mentioned user.


367
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,653 line:-1
Use the persistence event type
when content is moved,


368
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,955 line:-1
renamed, or deleted.


369
00:22:02.955 --> 00:22:05.991 line:-1 position:50%
Here, the renamed trigger type
is used to signify


370
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,262 line:-1
the document name
has been changed.


371
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,831 line:-1
Finally,
here is a membershipEvent.


372
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,467 line:-1
For a membershipEvent,
use the addedCollaborator


373
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:20,439 line:-1
or removedCollaborator
trigger type instead.


374
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,108 line:-1
With mentionevents,
notices are posted to show


375
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:26,212 line:-1
how the document
membership has changed.


376
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,582 line:-1
However, we've also made it
possible to keep collaborators


377
00:22:29.582 --> 00:22:31.850 line:-1 position:50%
on your shared documents
in sync


378
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,621 line:-1
when the Messages group
membership changes.


379
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:38,857 line:-1
For CloudKit and iCloud Drive,
this is simple:


380
00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:42.394 line:-1 position:50%
we do the work for you.


381
00:22:42.394 --> 00:22:45.097 line:-1 position:50%
When someone new is added
to the Messages group


382
00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:47.566 line:-1 position:50%
with a collaboration,
the document owner


383
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:51,637 line:-1
is prompted via a notice
to add them to the share.


384
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:54,807 line:-1
The same goes for when
someone is removed.


385
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,179 line:-1
For apps with custom
collaboration infrastructures,


386
00:23:00.179 --> 00:23:02.381 line:-1 position:50%
there's a little more work
to be done.


387
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,816 line:-1
You will need to adopt the


388
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:07,119 line:-1
SWCollaborationActionHandler
API,


389
00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:09.722 line:-1 position:50%
which you can learn more about
in "Integrate your custom


390
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,758 line:-1
collaboration app
with Messages."


391
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.163 line:-1 position:50%
Now you know how to get started
with collaboration in Messages


392
00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:22.134 line:-1 position:50%
and integrate it into your app,
whether you're using CloudKit,


393
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:26,305 line:-1
iCloud Drive, or your own
collaboration infrastructure.


394
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:29,708 line:-1
Prepare your app to initiate
collaborations by adopting


395
00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:33.712 line:-1 position:50%
the new share sheet
and drag and drop APIs.


396
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,215 line:-1
Integrate the new
collaboration UI


397
00:23:36.215 --> 00:23:38.117 line:-1 position:50%
to provide a customized overview


398
00:23:38.117 --> 00:23:41.687 line:-1 position:50%
of what is happening
in the shared document.


399
00:23:41.687 --> 00:23:43.155 line:-1 position:50%
Once you have that set up,


400
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:47,326 line:-1
go even further and adopt
notices to display changes


401
00:23:47.326 --> 00:23:51.063 line:-1 position:50%
to the collaboration
from within the Messages thread.


402
00:23:51.063 --> 00:23:54.199 line:-1 position:50%
Miranda and I can't wait to see
how your app takes advantage


403
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,569 line:-1
of these new collaboration
features in Messages!


404
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,738 line:-1
Both: Thank you for watching!
