Hi, I'm Alex Young,
and I'm an engineer


5
00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.515 line:-1 position:50%
on the iCloud developer
experience team.


6
00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.418 line:-1 position:50%
CloudKit is an easy way
to create great experiences


7
00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:21.321 line:-1 position:50%
by allowing users
to effortlessly synchronize data


8
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,624 line:-1
between devices.


9
00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:26.460 line:-1 position:50%
CloudKit Console helps to make
this even easier by providing


10
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.731 line:-1 position:50%
tools that let you work with
your app's schema and data.


11
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:33.600 line:-1 position:50%
I'm going to share several
updates to CloudKit Console


12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.369 line:-1 position:50%
that will help you
understand and debug


13
00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:38.171 line:-1 position:50%
your application's
schema and data.


14
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,909 line:-1
First, I'll walk through
how to use hidden containers,


15
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,311 line:-1
then dive into a new way
you can view records


16
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.713 line:-1 position:50%
using iCloud accounts,


17
00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.415 line:-1 position:50%
and finally,
there are some great updates


18
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,151 line:-1
for working with shared zones.


19
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,054 line:-1
It's common to create lots of
containers while in development,


20
00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.657 line:-1 position:50%
and only focus
on a few later on.


21
00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:57.891 line:-1 position:50%
You can better organize this


22
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,694 line:-1
with the new
hidden containers feature.


23
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,629 line:-1
In CloudKit Console,
you can choose


24
00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.499 line:-1 position:50%
which containers
are hidden or visible.


25
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,234 line:-1
Hidden containers
aren't just hidden


26
00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.403 line:-1 position:50%
from the lists
inside the Console,


27
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,538 line:-1
but also across
all developer tools,


28
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,740 line:-1
including Xcode.


29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,009 line:-1
Even better,
when a container is hidden,


30
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.878 line:-1 position:50%
it applies at the team level,


31
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,681 line:-1
which means all of your test
and prototype containers


32
00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:24.084 line:-1 position:50%
no longer clutter
your teammates' views.


33
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:28.655 line:-1 position:50%
I'll open the Console and use
this new functionality now.


34
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.424 line:-1 position:50%
Once you're signed in
to the Console,


35
00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:34.428 line:-1 position:50%
open the container selector
from the top-level navigation.


36
00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.830 line:-1 position:50%
Then click Manage Containers.


37
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.466 line:-1 position:50%
This displays a new menu
that allows you to toggle


38
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,704 line:-1
the visibility of every
container in the current team.


39
00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:46.773 line:-1 position:50%
For people with several teams,
you can switch between them


40
00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.576 line:-1 position:50%
using the account menu
in the top right.


41
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,378 line:-1
Then you can go on
to hide containers


42
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,381 line:-1
in your other teams as well.


43
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:57.351 line:-1 position:50%
Here's the container
from WWDC21,


44
00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:59.052 line:-1 position:50%
which isn't needed anymore.


45
00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.655 line:-1 position:50%
I can hide it, like this.


46
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,691 line:-1
And if you refresh
the container list in Xcode,


47
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,962 line:-1
you'll see the containers
are now hidden there too.


48
00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.565 line:-1 position:50%
I'll tell you about
a new addition to the Console


49
00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:13.900 line:-1 position:50%
that lets you view data
as iCloud accounts


50
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,236 line:-1
instead of your
developer account.


51
00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:19.806 line:-1 position:50%
This is called Act As iCloud.


52
00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.010 line:-1 position:50%
Sometimes, it can be difficult
to understand why certain users


53
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.814 line:-1 position:50%
are experiencing trouble with
data in their private databases.


54
00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.649 line:-1 position:50%
Now you have the ability
to sign in


55
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:34,087 line:-1
as a separate iCloud account
to view private data.


56
00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:36.156 line:-1 position:50%
When you're logged in
with an iCloud account,


57
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.226 line:-1 position:50%
CloudKit Console's query tools
work as you'd expect


58
00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:42.229 line:-1 position:50%
from the perspective
of that account.


59
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,497 line:-1
This helps you debug


60
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,868 line:-1
development and production
issues on behalf of your users.


61
00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:49.503 line:-1 position:50%
I'll demonstrate
this in the Console


62
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,572 line:-1
to illustrate how it works.


63
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,709 line:-1
This query was performed
using my developer account.


64
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,778 line:-1
I'm going to switch
to an iCloud account


65
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:01,014 line:-1
to show how
the query results change.


66
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:05.052 line:-1 position:50%
First, navigate to the
Act As iCloud account menu item.


67
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,254 line:-1
This will open a dialog
that allows you to sign in


68
00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:09.256 line:-1 position:50%
as an iCloud account.


69
00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:13.393 line:-1 position:50%
When I sign in, the context of
the Console is going to change.


70
00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.729 line:-1 position:50%
Now you'll see a banner
at the top of the page.


71
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,964 line:-1
All subsequent operations
will be performed


72
00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:22.402 line:-1 position:50%
using the iCloud account instead
of your developer account.


73
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,704 line:-1
You can query records
and view zones,


74
00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:28.909 line:-1 position:50%
but you cannot perform
schema operations.


75
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,911 line:-1
As you can see,
the results of this query


76
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:34,881 line:-1
are for my iCloud account,
not my developer account.


77
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,950 line:-1
Switching to another
container or environment


78
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,586 line:-1
will stop acting
as the iCloud account.


79
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,555 line:-1
You can also click
the button in the banner


80
00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:45.325 line:-1 position:50%
to stop the Act As session.


81
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,228 line:-1
Remember, acting as an iCloud
account applies to records,


82
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,597 line:-1
not schema,
so this feature only works


83
00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.100 line:-1 position:50%
in the data parts
of the Console.


84
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,370 line:-1
Attempting to access schema
will halt the Act As session.


85
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.272 line:-1 position:50%
This feature helps you
to better understand


86
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,374 line:-1
how your data
is used in production


87
00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:06.279 line:-1 position:50%
and investigate data-related
bugs more effectively.


88
00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.615 line:-1 position:50%
Encrypted fields
remain unreadable to you


89
00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.851 line:-1 position:50%
when acting as another account.


90
00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:14.721 line:-1 position:50%
Only the original user who
owns the data can decrypt it.


91
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,490 line:-1
This is by design
and helps iCloud


92
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.192 line:-1 position:50%
maintain a high level
of security and privacy


93
00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:23.163 line:-1 position:50%
and ensures
that sensitive data stays safe.


94
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:27,234 line:-1
Next, I'll show you how
to share zones in the Console.


95
00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.302 line:-1 position:50%
CloudKit sharing is a safe way


96
00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:33.006 line:-1 position:50%
to securely share records
between users of your app.


97
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,808 line:-1
This is sharing done securely,


98
00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:36.576 line:-1 position:50%
using permissions
that allow your app


99
00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:40.914 line:-1 position:50%
to determine a participant's
read and write access.


100
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,883 line:-1
Participant access
is further controlled


101
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:47,888 line:-1
by defining shares
as public or private.


102
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:52,192 line:-1
Zone sharing works by applying
rules to every record in a zone.


103
00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:54.861 line:-1 position:50%
A shared zone
has a CloudKit share record


104
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,430 line:-1
that contains the options
for accessing each record


105
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.599 line:-1 position:50%
in the zone.


106
00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.603 line:-1 position:50%
Shared zones cannot have
existing shared records.


107
00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.239 line:-1 position:50%
The standard public
and private zone sharing options


108
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:10,210 line:-1
are supported by shared zones.


109
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,113 line:-1
A public shared zone
makes every record visible


110
00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:15.615 line:-1 position:50%
to everyone who has
the share code.


111
00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:19.019 line:-1 position:50%
Anyone with the short share code
can join this share.


112
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,688 line:-1
This is ideal for records
that should be easy to share


113
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:25,458 line:-1
between users
without strict access control.


114
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,595 line:1
Private shared zones have
an additional layer of security


115
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,897 position:50%
because members must be
in the participant list


116
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,667 position:50%
to join the share.


117
00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.036 line:-1 position:50%
CloudKit Console
has several new tools


118
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,004 line:-1
for creating and viewing
zone shares,


119
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,240 line:-1
to help you
better understand shared zones


120
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.843 line:-1 position:50%
and work with them during
development and production.


121
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:48,582 line:-1
Let's create a zone share now
so you can learn how it works.


122
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:52,185 line:-1
Navigate to Zones, then select
a zone that you want to share.


123
00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.588 line:-1 position:50%
Click the Configure zone
wide sharing... button


124
00:05:54.588 --> 00:05:56.356 line:-1 position:50%
in the details view.


125
00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.091 line:-1 position:50%
This shows a form
that lets you decide


126
00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:01.461 line:-1 position:50%
if you want a public
or private share.


127
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,964 line:-1
Public zones have
an additional permission option


128
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:07,300 line:-1
for creating read-only
or read/write shares.


129
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,402 line:-1
For private shares,
the permissions are defined


130
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,504 line:-1
at a participant level.


131
00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:14.507 line:-1 position:50%
I'm going to create
a private share, like this.


132
00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.145 line:-1 position:50%
Once the zone is shared,
you will see a short unique ID


133
00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:23.950 line:-1 position:50%
that can be sent to participants
to join the share.


134
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,152 line:-1
Shared zones can be joined
in the console


135
00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:28.555 line:-1 position:50%
by using the Accept Shared
Record menu option


136
00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.057 line:-1 position:50%
found in the Records page.


137
00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.859 line:-1 position:50%
Now any record created
in this zone


138
00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.996 line:-1 position:50%
will be automatically shared.


139
00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:38.765 line:-1 position:50%
Now that you've seen these
updates to CloudKit Console,


140
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,269 line:-1
go and tidy up your container
lists by hiding containers,


141
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,938 line:-1
try out Act As iCloud
so you can see records


142
00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:48.341 line:-1 position:50%
with different iCloud accounts,
and try out zone sharing


143
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,945 line:-1
for easier sharing
of multiple records.


144
00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:54.581 line:-1 position:50%
We hope these tools
enable you to better understand


145
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,517 line:-1
your schema,
debug issues in your apps,


146
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,187 line:-1
and make CloudKit
a little easier to work with.


147
00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:03.623 line:-1 position:50%
Thanks, and have a great WWDC.
