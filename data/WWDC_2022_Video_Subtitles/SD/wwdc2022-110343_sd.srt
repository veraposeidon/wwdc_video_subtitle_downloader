Harry: Hi, I'm Harry,
an engineer on the SwiftUI team.


4
00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:21.221 line:-2 align:center
Welcome to the second part
of the SwiftUI on iPad series.


5
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,992 line:-2
In the first part of this series,
my colleague Raj dove deep


6
00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.294 line:-1 align:center
into how you can use lists, tables,


7
00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:30.330 line:-2 align:center
selection, and split views
to really make your apps shine


8
00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:34.935 line:-2 align:center
using the iPad's larger screens
and various input devices.


9
00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.470 line:-1 align:center
If you haven't seen that session,


10
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,839 line:-1
I highly recommend starting with that.


11
00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:42.109 line:-2 align:center
I really enjoyed seeing Raj build out
the Places app


12
00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.811 line:-2 align:center
and I wanted to add some features
of my own.


13
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,947 line:-2
So in this session
I'll be looking at something


14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,150 line:-1
near and dear to my heart, toolbars!


15
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,787 line:-2
In SwiftUI, the toolbar API
configures many system bars


16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,790 line:-2
like the navigation bar
or bottom bar on iOS


17
00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.493 line:-1 align:center
or the window toolbar on macOS.


18
00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:03.830 line:-2 align:center
Toolbars provide quick actions
to a lot of your most common features.


19
00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:09.036 line:-2 align:center
Creating a good toolbar can really improve
the productivity of people using your app.


20
00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.673 line:-2 align:center
I've been spending a lot of time
thinking about toolbars


21
00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:17.411 line:-2 align:center
and how Places could use some of
the new toolbar features in iOS 16.


22
00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:20.080 line:-2 align:center
I'd like to start by briefly showing you
what I've built


23
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,450 line:-2
to give you a taste
of what is now possible on iPad.


24
00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:28.021 line:-2 align:center
After all my changes,
here is the updated Places app.


25
00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:33.694 line:-2 align:center
You might notice some new features,
like leading aligned navigation titles,


26
00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:36.930 line:-1 align:center
title menus, title menu headers,


27
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,867 line:-1
and centered aligned toolbar items.


28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,036 line:-2
If you've used a Mac, you might
also be familiar with features


29
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.872 line:-1 align:center
like Toolbar customization,


30
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:48,575 line:-2
which allows people to make toolbars
uniquely their own.


31
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,412 line:-2
These powerful Mac features
are making their debut on the iPad.


32
00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:54.715 line:-1 align:center
To start this session,


33
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:58,185 line:-2
I'll show some enhancements
to the toolbar API.


34
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:02,589 line:-2
Then I'll walk you through
some new APIs for titles and documents.


35
00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:05.259 line:-1 align:center
So let's dive right in with toolbars.


36
00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:09.630 line:-2 align:center
Now, many of you have already configured
toolbars in your own iOS app


37
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,132 line:-1
and to optimize for a smaller screen,


38
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:16,236 line:-2
you might've added a menu like I did
when I first looked at Places.


39
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,073 line:-1
My menu looked like this in code.


40
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,946 line:-2
You can see I have a toolbar item
with a primary action placement.


41
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.948 line:-1 align:center
Inside, I have a more menu,


42
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,985 line:-1
with a few controls as the menu's content.


43
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,788 line:-1
Let's see what this looks like on iPad.


44
00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:38.125 line:-2 align:center
As you might have guessed,
it doesn't really take advantage


45
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.093 line:-1 align:center
of the space available there.


46
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,963 line:-1
What's great, though, is that in iOS 16,


47
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,900 line:-2
toolbars can implement these kind of menus
on your behalf.


48
00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:49.002 line:-1 align:center
We call these overflow menus


49
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,671 line:-1
and to make best use of them,


50
00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:53.841 line:-2 align:center
I'll want to restructure
the content of my toolbar.


51
00:02:55,008 --> 00:03:00,347 line:-2
I'll start by converting the toolbar item
into a toolbar item group.


52
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,083 line:-2
I'll then remove the menu
and make its content


53
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,320 line:-1
the content of the toolbar item group.


54
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:11,425 line:-2
This group inserts individual toolbar
items for each view in the group.


55
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,360 line:-2
On iPad and Mac,
this is all that's needed


56
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:17,364 line:-2
to automatically move items into
an overflow menu when needed.


57
00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:20.501 line:-2 align:center
There's more I can do here,
but before I can get to that,


58
00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.604 line:-2 align:center
I'll need to think about the placement
of my toolbar items.


59
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,708 line:-2
Placements define the area
in which a toolbar item is rendered.


60
00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:31.512 line:-2 align:center
Different placements
can resolve to the same area.


61
00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:35.682 line:-2 align:center
You can think of a navigation bar
as having three distinct areas:


62
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:40,053 line:-2
the leading, the center,
and the trailing area.


63
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:44,291 line:-2
The leading and trailing areas
typically contain controls.


64
00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:47.661 line:-2 align:center
While the center contains
your app's navigation title.


65
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,264 line:-2
Let's look at this
in the context of Places.


66
00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:54.668 line:-2 align:center
In Places
my primary action toolbar item group


67
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,872 line:-2
resolves to the trailing area
on iPad or Mac.


68
00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:02.376 line:-2 align:center
Primary actions represent
the most common action available


69
00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.878 line:-1 align:center
to the user for a particular screen.


70
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:10,317 line:-2
In iOS 16, there's a new placement
called secondary action.


71
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.221 line:-2 align:center
These items represent controls
that are not the most used controls,


72
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,957 line:-1
but still warrant their own toolbar items.


73
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.495 line:-2 align:center
Actions like favoriting and editing
aren't the most important in Places,


74
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,430 line:-1
so I'll make them secondary actions.


75
00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:29.403 line:-2 align:center
By default, secondary actions
will not be visible in the toolbar.


76
00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.973 line:-1 align:center
Instead, they live in the overflow menu.


77
00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:37.477 line:-2 align:center
You can change that behavior
by using the new toolbarRole modifier.


78
00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:44.885 line:-2 align:center
This modifier influences the behavior of
a toolbar by assigning it a semantic role.


79
00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:48.188 line:-2 align:center
Here I pass an editor role
which tells the navigation bar


80
00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:52.192 line:-2 align:center
that it should be optimized
for editing content.


81
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:55,562 line:-2
The navigation bar interprets this
as a desire to have more space


82
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:59,266 line:-2
to render toolbar items
and so it moves the navigation title


83
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,236 line:-1
from the center area to the leading area.


84
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,639 line:-2
This makes room for secondary actions
to be placed in the center


85
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,842 line:-1
before moving to the overflow menu.


86
00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:12.379 line:-2 align:center
In compact size classes,
the navigation bar doesn't change


87
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,649 line:-2
and continues to render the title
in the center.


88
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,953 line:-2
Using the secondary action
and toolbar role API


89
00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:23.957 line:-2 align:center
really lets Places start to take advantage
of the iPad's size.


90
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,661 line:-2
With the center available to me,
I can add more items to my toolbar,


91
00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:29.997 line:-2 align:center
like a noise button,
or a comfort level button,


92
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,265 line:-1
or a trash button.


93
00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:33.433 line:-1 align:center
But if I start adding a lot of items,


94
00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:37.104 line:-2 align:center
my toolbar might become unwieldy
for some users.


95
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,973 line:-2
MacOS has long supported
customizable toolbars


96
00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:43.177 line:-2 align:center
which lets each person choose the toolbar
best for them


97
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,682 line:-2
and I'm excited to say that now iPadOS
also supports user customization.


98
00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:51.919 line:-2 align:center
You can use the existing toolbar
customization API


99
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,521 line:-2
that's worked on macOS
to adopt this feature.


100
00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:56.590 line:-1 align:center
Let's look at that now.


101
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,760 line:-1
Only toolbar items are customizable


102
00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:05.365 line:-2 align:center
so I'll first split up my toolbar item
group into individual toolbar items.


103
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,602 line:-2
Note that there is no functional
difference after this change.


104
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,905 line:-2
Customization also requires
every item in the toolbar


105
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,808 line:-1
to be associated with a unique identifier


106
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:18,011 line:-1
so I'll add IDs to each of my items.


107
00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:22.783 line:-2 align:center
It's important for these IDs to be unique
and consistent across app launches.


108
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,052 line:-1
When a user customizes their toolbar,


109
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,287 line:-1
SwiftUI persists these IDs


110
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:31.225 line:-2 align:center
and uses them to look up
the associated view to render.


111
00:06:31.258 --> 00:06:34.962 line:-2 align:center
Finally, I'll add an ID
to the toolbar modifier as a whole.


112
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,465 line:-2
Altogether, this opts the toolbar
into supporting customization.


113
00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.935 line:-1 align:center
Unique to customizable toolbars,


114
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:46,874 line:-2
toolbar items have the ability to not be
initially present in the toolbar.


115
00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:50.210 line:-2 align:center
These items start their life
in the customization popover


116
00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:52.880 line:-1 align:center
and can be added to the toolbar later.


117
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,082 line:-2
Because these items
aren't initially present,


118
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:59,620 line:-2
this is a good option for actions that are
more useful to specific workflows.


119
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,021 line:-1
Let's check them out.


120
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:06,760 line:-2
I want to hide some of my current toolbar
items to make my new items easier to see.


121
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,131 line:-2
Now let's add a toolbar item
that contains a share link.


122
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:16,503 line:-2
Share links are new in SwiftUI and rely on
a new protocol called transferable.


123
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:19,473 line:-2
For more information
on Transferable and ShareLink,


124
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,743 line:-2
be sure to check out
the Meet Transferable session.


125
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,411 line:-1
With my toolbar item in place,


126
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,048 line:-2
I'll provide a value of false to the shows
by default parameter


127
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:31,418 line:-2
which makes this item
not be initially present in the bar.


128
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,255 line:-2
Now you can see my share link
living its best life


129
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,392 line:-1
in the customization popover.


130
00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:42.596 line:-2 align:center
And I'm able to drag it from
the customization popover into the bar.


131
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.465 line:-1 align:center
People are going to love that.


132
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,868 line:-2
With my share link in place,
I started to think about


133
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:51,471 line:-1
the relationship between my toolbar items.


134
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,607 line:-1
After moving the share link into the bar,


135
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,477 line:-2
I noticed that my image
and map adjustment items are separated,


136
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,814 line:-2
but I think of these items
as a group of quick editing control,


137
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:04,418 line:-2
and I'd like to model that relationship
in the toolbar itself.


138
00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:09.890 line:-2 align:center
iOS 16 and macOS Ventura support
modeling this relationship


139
00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:11.692 line:-1 align:center
by using ControlGroup.


140
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,894 line:-1
I'll show you how.


141
00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:16.430 line:-2 align:center
You can see
I have two individual toolbar items


142
00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:19.166 line:-1 align:center
for my image and map adjustment actions.


143
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,904 line:-2
To group them together,
I'll first move them to the same item.


144
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,240 line:-1
Then I'll wrap them in a control group.


145
00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:32.613 line:-2 align:center
A user can now add or remove them
from the toolbar as a unit.


146
00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:35.682 line:-2 align:center
That's pretty cool,
but I can take this even further


147
00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:39.720 line:-1 align:center
using a new API available on ControlGroup.


148
00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:42.356 line:-1 align:center
By providing a label to the control group,


149
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,859 line:-2
this group of items can collapse
into its own smaller menu


150
00:08:45.893 --> 00:08:49.162 line:-1 align:center
before moving into the overflow menu.


151
00:08:50.063 --> 00:08:52.266 line:-2 align:center
The toolbar is really
starting to come together.


152
00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:54.701 line:-1 align:center
There's one last change I'd like to make.


153
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:58,372 line:-2
Adding a new place
is a common and important action,


154
00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:00.774 line:-2 align:center
so I'd like to add a toolbar item
for that.


155
00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:05.546 line:-2 align:center
To do that,
I'll add a new button to my toolbar,


156
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,949 line:-2
but this time
I'll use the primary action placement


157
00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:12.486 line:-2 align:center
as I consider the new button
to be the most common action.


158
00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:19.593 line:-2 align:center
This placement highlights an important
distinction between iOS and macOS.


159
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:25,465 line:-2
All items within a customizable toolbar
modifier support customization on macOS,


160
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:29,903 line:-2
but on iPadOS,
only secondary actions do.


161
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:33,540 line:-2
So my new button here renders
in the trailing area of the bar


162
00:09:33.574 --> 00:09:37.010 line:-1 align:center
and is not customizable by the user.


163
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,378 line:-1
Wow!


164
00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:39.780 line:-1 align:center
That was a lot about toolbars


165
00:09:39.813 --> 00:09:41.748 line:-1 align:center
and those aren't the only improvements.


166
00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:44.117 line:-2 align:center
Navigation titles gained
some new features as well


167
00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:46.854 line:-1 align:center
around menus, documents, and more.


168
00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:49.223 line:-1 align:center
Let's take documents as an example.


169
00:09:49.256 --> 00:09:51.191 line:-1 align:center
There are lot of kinds of documents.


170
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:53,493 line:-2
You might be familiar with documents
that are managed


171
00:09:53.527 --> 00:09:55.996 line:-1 align:center
by the document group API.


172
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,233 line:-2
Document groups come with
a lot of built-in functionality


173
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,236 line:-2
for representing
and managing their documents.


174
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:06,673 line:-2
All of what I'm about to talk about
comes for free when using document groups.


175
00:10:07.975 --> 00:10:12.779 line:-2 align:center
In Places, though, an individual place
can be considered a document


176
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:16,717 line:-2
even though Places
isn't using a document group.


177
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.485 line:-1 align:center
It has properties that you can edit,


178
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,021 line:-2
you can add or remove them
to the Places app,


179
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,357 line:-2
and you can share
a place with your friends.


180
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.726 line:-2 align:center
Let's look at how
we can show off this relationship


181
00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:28.562 line:-1 align:center
in a non-document group based app.


182
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:33,400 line:-2
I already associate the name of the place
as the navigation title of the view.


183
00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:38.105 line:-2 align:center
So I'm already associating a piece
of the place to the title of my toolbar.


184
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,074 line:-1
In iOS 16, I can take that even further


185
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:44,144 line:-1
by using new navigation title modifiers.


186
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:47,481 line:-2
Navigation titles now support
presenting a menu.


187
00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:51.185 line:-2 align:center
You can kind of think of this
like the File menu on macOS.


188
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,886 line:-1
To create one of these menus,


189
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,722 line:-2
provide a set of actions
to the navigation title,


190
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,925 line:-1
just like you would a normal menu.


191
00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.528 line:-2 align:center
Notice that the title now has
a menu indicator attached to it


192
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:04,765 line:-2
that presents a menu
populated with your actions.


193
00:11:04.798 --> 00:11:07.801 line:-2 align:center
And that's not all
navigation titles can do.


194
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:12,573 line:-2
One of my favorite parts is its
new ability to support editable titles.


195
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,209 line:-2
You can pass a binding
to your navigation title


196
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:19,513 line:-2
and this tells the toolbar
that you support editing the title.


197
00:11:19.546 --> 00:11:23.317 line:-2 align:center
All you're missing is a way
to actually start editing.


198
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,987 line:-2
You can use the new RenameButton
inside your titles menus actions


199
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.889 line:-1 align:center
to accomplish this.


200
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:34,595 line:-2
Tapping on the rename button
allows you to start renaming the title.


201
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:37,831 line:-2
Just like you can associate
a navigation title to your view,


202
00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:42.135 line:-2 align:center
you can now also associate a document,
like my place.


203
00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:44.671 line:-2 align:center
When provided a document,
the title menu renders


204
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,408 line:-2
a specialized header that shows
a preview of that document.


205
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:53,080 line:-2
The preview can be dragged and there's
quick access to share the document.


206
00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:56.517 line:-2 align:center
To get one of these headers,
associate your navigation document


207
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,654 line:-2
to your view using the new
navigation document modifier.


208
00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:02.523 line:-1 align:center
You can do this by providing a type


209
00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:06.960 line:-2 align:center
that conforms to transferable,
or by providing a URL directly.


210
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:12,299 line:-2
Here I'll provide a URL that will open
the Maps app to the place I'm viewing.


211
00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:16.570 line:-2 align:center
The navigation document modifier
will also configure the proxy icon


212
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:20,174 line:-2
of the window toolbar on macOS
when providing a URL.


213
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:25,279 line:-2
After all that, I think I'll take a break
from updating my app's toolbars.


214
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,614 line:-2
Can you believe all the features
I've added in this time?


215
00:12:27.648 --> 00:12:30.150 line:-1 align:center
I can't wait to start using them.


216
00:12:30.184 --> 00:12:35.255 line:-2 align:center
I covered a lot in my journey
to improve the Places experience on iPad.


217
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,491 line:-2
Toolbars on iPad have gained
a lot of new features


218
00:12:37.524 --> 00:12:41.061 line:-2 align:center
like overflow menus
and user customization.


219
00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:44.698 line:-2 align:center
Use the secondary action placement
and customization APIs


220
00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:48.535 line:-2 align:center
to really make the most of the larger
space available on iPad and Mac.


221
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,640 line:-2
Titles have gained some new ways
to represent themselves in the toolbar.


222
00:12:53.674 --> 00:12:59.546 line:-2 align:center
Use a navigation title or create
a title menu or support title renaming.


223
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.351 line:-2 align:center
And remember to use the navigation
document modifier when appropriate.


224
00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:07.221 line:-2 align:center
I hope you've enjoyed
the SwiftUI on iPad series.


225
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:10,424 line:-2
With all the improvements in tables,
selection, toolbars, and more,


226
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,260 line:-2
go out and take your iPad apps
to the next level.


227
00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.662 line:-1 align:center
Thank you, and have a great WW.
