00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.080 line:-2 align:center
Hello, I'm Devin Rousso,
an engineer on the WebKit team,


4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,250 line:-2
and I'm here today to share with you
the exciting new opportunity


5
00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:19.186 line:-2 align:center
to create extensions
for Safari's Web Inspector.


6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,589 line:-2
Web Inspector is the primary
developer tool for debugging web content


7
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,791 line:-1
on all of Apple's platforms.


8
00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:29.162 line:-2 align:center
It already has a ton of built-in
functionality for debugging websites,


9
00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:31.231 line:-2 align:center
but there are often areas
of web development


10
00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:35.102 line:-2 align:center
that are difficult to build into
a generalized developer tool.


11
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:38,038 line:-2
Maybe you're debugging
a popular JavaScript library,


12
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.375 line:-2 align:center
or you just need something more specific
to what you're working on.


13
00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:44.077 line:-2 align:center
Web Inspector extensions
are a fantastic solution


14
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,313 line:-1
for these personal workflow scenarios.


15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,818 line:-2
By utilizing cross-browser web extensions
and the DevTools APIs,


16
00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:56.456 line:-2 align:center
you can now add your own tabs
in Web Inspector in Safari 16.


17
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.793 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a quick look
at a Web Inspector extension in action,


18
00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.162 line:-2 align:center
and then I'll show you
how you can build your own.


19
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:05,265 line:-2
First I'll open Safari's
extension preferences.


20
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.070 line:-1 align:center
And enable a Web Inspector extension.


21
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,807 line:-2
Then I'll close Safari's extension
preferences and inspect the page.


22
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,046 line:-2
I'll do that from the Develop menu,
Show Web Inspector.


23
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,416 line:-2
In Web Inspector,
not only can I see the many built-in tabs


24
00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:23.951 line:-1 align:center
like the Elements Tab,


25
00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:28.121 line:-2 align:center
but also the tab for the Web Inspector
extension I just enabled.


26
00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:30.591 line:-2 align:center
Because we've just enabled
this extension, however,


27
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,628 line:-2
we first have to give it permission
to work with the currently inspected page.


28
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,965 line:-2
I have the same permission
duration options as other extensions


29
00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:39.700 line:-1 align:center
outside of Web Inspector,


30
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.336 line:-2 align:center
so for now
let's give it access for one day.


31
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,839 line:-2
This Open Graph extension is
what I'll be building in this session.


32
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:49,810 line:-2
It displays the common social media
metadata that most websites put


33
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,012 line:-2
on their pages
for use by link previews


34
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,882 line:-1
in Messages and other social media sites.


35
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,552 line:-2
Now that we've gotten a quick look
at what a Web Inspector extension can do,


36
00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.687 line:-1 align:center
let's talk about how they're built.


37
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:03.757 line:-2 align:center
Like other Safari Web Extensions,
Web Inspector extensions


38
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.527 line:-2 align:center
are distributed via an app
in the App Store.


39
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,798 line:-2
To build your own Web Inspector extension,
you will need to have Xcode,


40
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:15,936 line:-2
Apple's app creation tool
for building Mac and iOS apps.


41
00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.273 line:-2 align:center
Xcode also comes with project templates
to help jumpstart


42
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,408 line:-1
making a new Safari extension app.


43
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.777 line:-2 align:center
If you already have
an existing web extension


44
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,512 line:-1
you've created for another browser,


45
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,815 line:-2
you can also use
Xcode's bundled conversion tool.


46
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:32,219 line:-2
Simply run safari-web-extension-converter
from the Terminal,


47
00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.621 line:-2 align:center
passing a path
to your extension's directory


48
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,491 line:-1
that contains the manifest.json file.


49
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,527 line:-2
A full app project will then be created
for your extension


50
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,029 line:-1
that is ready to build and run.


51
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,932 align:center
For more information on this tool,


52
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,836 align:center
check out Meet Safari Web Extensions
from WWDC 2020,


53
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,971 line:0
as well as the online documentation.


54
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:56.476 line:-2 align:center
So today I'm going to go over the basic
structure of a Web Inspector extension,


55
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.147 line:-2 align:center
cover how to best evaluate code
in that extension,


56
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.650 line:-2 align:center
and discuss some good
best practices for your users.


57
00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:05.118 line:-1 align:center
Let's get started.


58
00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:11.024 line:-2 align:center
Web Inspector extensions are structured
just like other Safari Web Extensions,


59
00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:14.928 line:-2 align:center
with a toolbar icon, background page,
content scripts, and more,


60
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:18,432 line:-2
but they also have
a dedicated devtools background page.


61
00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:21.068 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a look at how that works
in practice.


62
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,403 line:-2
The structure
of a typical Safari Web Extension


63
00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:26.473 line:-2 align:center
begins with a manifest file
that declares the basic details


64
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:30,944 line:-2
about the extension, like the name,
icons, descriptions, and more.


65
00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:34.882 line:-2 align:center
It can declare a background page
to handle all the behind-the-scenes logic


66
00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:36.450 line:-1 align:center
of your extension,


67
00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:40.287 line:-2 align:center
and can also declare any content scripts
used to inject functionality


68
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,790 line:-1
into web pages visited by the user.


69
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,794 line:-2
For Web Inspector extensions,
a couple other pages enter the mix.


70
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,898 line:-2
First there is a required
devtools background page


71
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:54,401 line:-2
for the behind-the-scenes logic
of your Web Inspector extension.


72
00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:58.338 line:-2 align:center
This page has access
to the unique devtools APIs


73
00:03:58.372 --> 00:04:01.775 line:-2 align:center
and only a limited set
of content script APIs.


74
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:06,113 line:-2
From this devtools background page
you can create devtools tab pages


75
00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:08.215 line:-1 align:center
that will be shown in Web Inspector.


76
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,485 line:-2
But all of that is just for
a single Web Inspector.


77
00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:15.422 line:-2 align:center
If there are multiple Web Inspectors,
each has its own instance


78
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,758 line:-1
of this same devtools background page,


79
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,762 line:-2
staying alive for the duration
that the related Web Inspector is open.


80
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,932 line:-2
As such,
you might also have multiple instances


81
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,701 line:-1
of each devtools tab page as well.


82
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,103 line:-2
Let's take a look
at how this structure looks in practice,


83
00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:33.607 line:-2 align:center
and start building my Open Graph
Web Inspector extension.


84
00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:37.544 line:-2 align:center
I'll start by creating a new project
in Xcode.


85
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:45,219 line:-2
The project type I'm going to create
is a Safari Extension App.


86
00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:48.755 line:-2 align:center
I only really need macOS,
but I'm going to leave it as is,


87
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,392 line:-2
in multiplatform, in case I want to add
iOS functionality in the future.


88
00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:56.496 line:-2 align:center
I'm going to name this "Open Graph",
and keep the rest of the defaults.


89
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,300 line:-2
Note that you need to pick a team
and bundle identifier


90
00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:02.970 line:-2 align:center
based on the Apple developer account
you're using.


91
00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:05.672 line:-2 align:center
And finally,
I'm going to save this on the Desktop.


92
00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:11.979 line:-2 align:center
Now I have a generic Safari Web Extension
project, ready for me to modify.


93
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,681 line:-2
I am first taken
to the manifest.json file,


94
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:18,151 line:-2
which is the root configuration file
for every web extension.


95
00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:22.422 line:-2 align:center
The manifest file references the other
resources that make up your extension–


96
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:26,693 line:-2
localizations, images,
pages, scripts, styles, and more.


97
00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:30.330 line:-2 align:center
For my Web Inspector extension,
I won't need some of these files,


98
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:33,867 line:-2
like the background page,
content scripts, or popup,


99
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,303 line:-2
so I'm going to delete them from
the manifest


100
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,772 line:-1
and from the entire project.


101
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:46,313 line:-2
Okay, let's start making this
a Web Inspector extension.


102
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,184 line:-2
To do that I need to add
a devtools background page to the manifest


103
00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:52.386 line:-1 align:center
and create a corresponding file for it,


104
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,722 line:-2
as well as a JavaScript file
I'm going to use inside it.


105
00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:58.926 line:-1 align:center
I'm going to go to File - New - File...


106
00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:04.765 line:-2 align:center
And scroll down
to find the Empty file template.


107
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:16,176 line:-2
I'm going to call this file
"devtools_background.html"


108
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,679 line:-1
to match the name I used in the manifest.


109
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:24,318 line:-2
The location is already set
to be right next to my other resources


110
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:28,589 line:-2
and part of the correct targets,
so I don't need to change anything here.


111
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:35,329 line:-2
I'll repeat the same steps again
with the JavaScript file...


112
00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:44.338 line:-1 align:center
…which I'll call "devtools_background.js".


113
00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:52.679 line:-2 align:center
Finally, I need to include the JavaScript
file in my devtools background page.


114
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,985 line:-2
Remember, this page gets created
when Web Inspector opens,


115
00:06:58.018 --> 00:07:02.189 line:-2 align:center
and is responsible for creating the custom
tabs that appear in Web Inspector.


116
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,191 line:-1
I almost always want to create a tab


117
00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:07.294 line:-2 align:center
so that, if needed,
the permissions I saw earlier


118
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,997 line:-2
will be displayed to my users
right there in-line,


119
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,598 line:-1
instead of in some other place.


120
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:15,502 line:-2
This devtools panels create API
takes three simple arguments.


121
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:18,539 line:-1
The first is the name of the tab.


122
00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:21.074 line:-2 align:center
For that,
I am using the localization method


123
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,977 line:-2
to look up the localized name
of my extension.


124
00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:26.947 line:-1 align:center
The next argument is the icon path to use.


125
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,018 line:-2
Note that this should be a vector image
to smoothly scale to any size


126
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,921 line:-2
if the user chooses
to zoom their user interface.


127
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,758 line:-2
But in order to use this icon, I need to
make sure it's part of my project,


128
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,827 line:-2
along with all of the other icons
I need for my extension.


129
00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:44.965 line:-2 align:center
The icons in the "images" folder are still
the defaults from the project template.


130
00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:47.534 line:-1 align:center
So let's delete these from the project.


131
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,373 line:-2
And replace them with some icons
I created earlier...


132
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:02,115 line:-2
…including the "logo.svg" I am trying to
use when creating the devtools tab.


133
00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:08.522 line:-2 align:center
Now that this is here, I'll go back
to the devtools background script.


134
00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:14.595 line:-2 align:center
The third argument is the HTML used
by the tab in Web Inspector.


135
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,496 line:-2
And just like
with the images a moment ago,


136
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.566 line:-2 align:center
I need to create this page
before I can use it.


137
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,643 line:-1
I'll name this "devtools_tab.html"


138
00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.179 line:-1 align:center
to match the name I gave the API.


139
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,019 line:-2
Unlike the devtools background page,
however,


140
00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:42.756 line:-2 align:center
this devtools tab page
will actually be shown to the user,


141
00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:47.194 line:-2 align:center
so this time I'll create both
a JavaScript and CSS file.


142
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:59,640 line:-2
I'll name the JavaScript file
"devtools_tab.js"...


143
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:06,947 line:-1
…and the CSS file "devtools_tab.css".


144
00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.817 line:-2 align:center
It's great that I've already set up
this structure,


145
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,787 line:-2
but for now I'll just add the usual
"Hello World"


146
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,822 line:-2
to make sure that things
are working correctly.


147
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,859 line:-2
But don't worry, we'll dive deeper
into this a little bit later,


148
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,129 line:-2
because first,
we still have a few more icons to replace


149
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:25,232 line:-2
to make sure this extension
has a consistent look.


150
00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:28.569 line:-2 align:center
First we need to replace
the default large icon...


151
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,140 line:-1
…by deleting it...


152
00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:37.644 line:-1 align:center
…and dragging my large icon in its place.


153
00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:44.017 line:-2 align:center
Since this large icon
is part of the app, however,


154
00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:46.520 line:-1 align:center
I need to add it to the right target.


155
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,727 line:-2
The remaining icons are all part
of the Assets catalog,


156
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.530 line:-1 align:center
specifically the AppIcon set.


157
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.670 line:-2 align:center
I've already prepared these icons,
so I'll just paste them in.


158
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:07,241 line:-2
And with that, I think we've replaced
all of the default icons,


159
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,976 line:-1
so I'm now going to run my extension.


160
00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:13.347 line:-2 align:center
Note that this may take a few seconds
the first time the project is built.


161
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:21,622 line:-1
And there it is!


162
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,091 line:-2
Most of this UI
is from the Xcode template,


163
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,895 line:-2
but I do correctly see
my icon instead of the default one.


164
00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:30.964 line:-2 align:center
Once we've launched
the Safari extension app at least once,


165
00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:33.233 line:-2 align:center
we can close it,
as the app doesn't need to be running


166
00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:34.902 line:-1 align:center
anymore for Safari to pick it up.


167
00:10:39.373 --> 00:10:41.508 line:-2 align:center
But before I can see it in Safari,
however,


168
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:44,611 line:-2
I have to Allow Unsigned Extensions
in the Develop menu


169
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,514 line:-1
as this is a locally built unsigned app.


170
00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:49.950 line:-1 align:center
Now, in Safari's Extensions preferences,


171
00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:53.520 line:-2 align:center
I can see Open Graph.
I'll turn it on.


172
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:56,790 line:-2
I'm going to open a Safari tab
and browse to apple.com


173
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,026 line:-1
so that I can try my extension.


174
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,596 line:-2
And already we can see
that my icon is in the toolbar.


175
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,834 line:-2
And my extension tab
is now in the tab bar.


176
00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:09.369 line:-1 align:center
Switching to it,


177
00:11:09.403 --> 00:11:12.239 line:-2 align:center
we can see the same permission prompt we
saw earlier.


178
00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:14.508 line:-2 align:center
This permission prompt
is automatically shown


179
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,944 line:-2
if permissions are needed
by the extension.


180
00:11:16.977 --> 00:11:20.414 line:-2 align:center
Just like earlier,
I'll allow it for one day.


181
00:11:21.682 --> 00:11:25.219 line:-2 align:center
And there's the "Hello World"
I added to the devtools tab page earlier.


182
00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:30.457 line:-2 align:center
Those are the basics of how to create
a Web Inspector extension for Safari 16.


183
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,825 line:-1
Let's recap.


184
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:36,063 line:-2
I declared the devtools background page
and added it to my Xcode project.


185
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,733 line:-2
From there, I was able to create
a new tab in Web Inspector


186
00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.335 line:-1 align:center
to show my custom tooling.


187
00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:45.305 line:-2 align:center
And finally, I've started considering
the permissions my extension needs.


188
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,443 line:-2
For a Web Inspector extension,
this often boils down to evaluating code


189
00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:52.446 line:-2 align:center
in the inspected page,
usually to extract some data


190
00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:54.448 line:-1 align:center
for display inside of Web Inspector.


191
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:58,252 line:-2
Web Extensions already have
a number of ways to evaluate code.


192
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,987 line:-1
For Web Inspector extensions,


193
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.322 line:-2 align:center
there is another API
that is the preferred method


194
00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:05.392 line:-2 align:center
of evaluating scripts
inside the inspected page.


195
00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:10.631 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a look at this API and see how
I can use it for my OpenGraph extension.


196
00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:14.735 line:-2 align:center
This devtools extension API to evaluate
JavaScript in the inspected window


197
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,171 line:-1
is the best way to get quick results.


198
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:20,407 line:-2
It will automatically target the page
associated with the Web Inspector


199
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,476 line:-1
your extension is running in.


200
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:27.447 line:-2 align:center
Remember, the user could be inspecting
multiple pages at the same time.


201
00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:30.050 line:-2 align:center
There are also some useful options
for this API


202
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,452 line:-1
that can help you get the right results.


203
00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:35.889 line:-2 align:center
By default the expression given
to this API is evaluated


204
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:39,893 line:-2
in the context of the main frame
of the inspected page.


205
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,162 line:-1
But you can use the frameURL option


206
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:45,465 line:-2
to specify evaluation
inside a different frame.


207
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,035 line:-2
This is needed when your extension
needs to extract data


208
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,971 line:-2
from one of many possible sub-frames
in the page.


209
00:12:51.004 --> 00:12:54.842 line:-2 align:center
For my OpenGraph extension,
I only need to worry about the main frame,


210
00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:56.543 line:-1 align:center
but I recommend you keep this in mind


211
00:12:56.577 --> 00:12:59.880 line:-2 align:center
when evaluating scripts
for your Web Inspector extensions.


212
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,983 line:-2
Let's take a look at how I can use
this function in my extension


213
00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:05.853 line:-2 align:center
to get and display data
from the inspected page.


214
00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:09.790 line:-2 align:center
I'll start by replacing the placeholder
"Hello World" I added earlier


215
00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:14.094 line:-2 align:center
with HTML that actually loads
my CSS and JavaScript files.


216
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:22,503 line:-2
Then I'll add some basic CSS
to give my devtools tab a nice style.


217
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:27.674 line:-2 align:center
I want to make sure that my devtools tab
fits in with the rest of Web Inspector,


218
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,578 line:-2
so I've declared
a root `color-scheme` property


219
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:36,083 line:-2
that will make my devtools tab match the
appearance of the rest of Web Inspector.


220
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:41,054 line:-2
I am using a system font family
and inheriting the font size,


221
00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:44.725 line:-2 align:center
and matching the colors
of more important text.


222
00:13:44.758 --> 00:13:48.529 line:-1 align:center
As far as functionality,


223
00:13:48.562 --> 00:13:50.264 line:-1 align:center
I'll start by adding some text


224
00:13:50.297 --> 00:13:53.834 line:-2 align:center
in case the page doesn't have
any opengraph metadata.


225
00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:57.971 line:-2 align:center
Note that I can use web extension
localized strings in Web Inspector


226
00:13:58.005 --> 00:14:00.474 line:-2 align:center
just like I can anywhere else
in a web extension.


227
00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:04.478 line:-2 align:center
But in order to do so, I need to add
that same localized string identifier


228
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,380 line:-1
to the localized strings file.


229
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,783 line:-1
Next,


230
00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:13.687 line:-2 align:center
I'll create the JavaScript
I'll provide to the powerful devtools


231
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,789 line:-1
inspectedWindow eval API,


232
00:14:15.822 --> 00:14:18.192 line:-2 align:center
which lets me evaluate it
in the inspected page.


233
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:21,428 line:-2
In this case,
I want to query the inspected page's DOM


234
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,097 line:-1
for some common opengraph metadata,


235
00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:28.836 line:-1 align:center
specifically the title, description...


236
00:14:30.737 --> 00:14:33.607 line:-1 align:center
…and image,


237
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,344 line:-2
as well as the current ready state
of the inspected page's document,


238
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:41.815 line:-2 align:center
bundling it all together to send back
to the devtools page via the return value.


239
00:14:41.849 --> 00:14:45.152 line:-2 align:center
Once that's done,
I can grab the HTML element


240
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:48,488 line:-2
that corresponds
to each of these properties


241
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:51,992 line:-2
and configure them so that they show
the data that was gathered.


242
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:58,699 line:-2
And if the document isn't quite ready yet,
I can try again after a short delay.


243
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:03,837 line:-2
I also want to redo all of this
every time the inspected page navigates,


244
00:15:03.871 --> 00:15:07.074 line:-2 align:center
so I'll add a listener
for devtools network onNavigated.


245
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,653 line:-2
This all looks great,
so I'll build again to test it.


246
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:30,297 line:-2
Now, whenever I open Web Inspector or
navigate with Web Inspector already open,


247
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.968 line:-2 align:center
I can see the opengraph title,
description, and image of every page.


248
00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:38.305 line:-2 align:center
And that's a simple example of
how to use some of the many new


249
00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:41.275 line:-1 align:center
and powerful Web Inspector extension APIs.


250
00:15:41.308 --> 00:15:44.378 line:-2 align:center
My OpenGraph extension
is coming along very nicely.


251
00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:47.414 line:-2 align:center
My Web Inspector extension's
devtools tab page


252
00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:50.684 line:-2 align:center
is now able to evaluate
in the inspected page.


253
00:15:50.717 --> 00:15:54.221 line:-2 align:center
I'm able to take the result data
and process it


254
00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:57.491 line:-2 align:center
to display it in a user friendly format
for quick access.


255
00:15:57.524 --> 00:16:00.761 line:-2 align:center
So what are some great ways to make
great user experiences


256
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,729 line:-1
when creating a Web Inspector extension?


257
00:16:02.763 --> 00:16:07.301 line:-2 align:center
Always create devtools tab pages
from the devtools background page.


258
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:11,572 line:-2
This way, the user can see where
these tabs will appear in Web Inspector,


259
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:15,075 line:-2
and any appropriate permission prompting
will be shown in-line.


260
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,744 line:-2
Instead of asking
for specific host permissions,


261
00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:19.880 line:-1 align:center
try to use the activeTab permission


262
00:16:19.913 --> 00:16:22.816 line:-2 align:center
to keep Web Inspector extensions
as targeted as possible.


263
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,719 line:-2
And make sure to use
the CSS color-scheme property


264
00:16:25.752 --> 00:16:28.422 line:-1 align:center
or the web extension devtools theme APIs


265
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,657 line:-2
to match the overall theme
of Web Inspector.


266
00:16:30.691 --> 00:16:34.161 line:-2 align:center
So today I showed you at how to create
entirely new debugging tools


267
00:16:34.194 --> 00:16:36.096 line:-1 align:center
with Web Inspector extensions


268
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,399 line:-2
and covered some great best practices
to keep in mind while doing so.


269
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:42,603 line:-2
You're welcome to download
the OpenGraph Web Inspector extension
