Ahmed: Hi, my name is Ahmed, and
I work on the Clang and Swift compilers.


4
00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:17.684 line:-2 align:center
In this session we're going to dive deep
into changes we've made


5
00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:21.788 line:-2 align:center
to make common Swift and Objective-C
operations faster and more efficient,


6
00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:24.558 line:-2 align:center
so that we can improve your app's size
and runtime performance.


7
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,494 line:-2
When you write code
in Swift or Objective-C,


8
00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:30.764 line:-2 align:center
you're always really interacting
with two major components.


9
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,733 line:-1
First, you build using Xcode,


10
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.435 line:-2 align:center
and that uses the Swift
and Clang compilers.


11
00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.138 line:-2 align:center
But when you run your app,
a lot of the heavy lifting is done


12
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:41,441 line:-1
in the Swift and Objective-C Runtime.


13
00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:45.345 line:-2 align:center
The runtime is embedded in the operating
systems for all of our platforms.


14
00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.584 line:-2 align:center
What the compiler cannot do at build time,
the runtime does, well, at run time.


15
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,386 line:-2
We're going to look at several
improvements we've made


16
00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:54.488 line:-1 align:center
in both compilers and runtimes.


17
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:58.192 line:-2 align:center
Now, this session is a bit unusual;
there are no new APIs,


18
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,727 line:-1
language changes, or new build settings.


19
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,430 line:-2
You don't have to change your code,
so all these improvements are transparent


20
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,632 line:-1
to you, the developer.


21
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.700 line:-1 align:center
Let's dive in.


22
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.902 line:-1 align:center
We're going to look at four improvements.


23
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:11,538 line:-2
We've made protocol checks in Swift
more efficient,


24
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,708 line:-2
we've also made Objective-C message send
calls smaller,


25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,944 line:-1
as we did retain and release calls,


26
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:21,248 line:-2
and finally, we've made autorelease
elision faster and smaller.


27
00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:22.783 line:-1 align:center
Let's take a closer look.


28
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,953 line:-1
Let's start with protocol checks in Swift.


29
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.090 line:-1 align:center
Here we have a CustomLoggable protocol.


30
00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.527 line:-2 align:center
It has a read-only computed property
customLogString,


31
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.262 line:-1 align:center
and we can use it in our log function,


32
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,832 line:-2
that has special handling
for CustomLoggable objects.


33
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:42,636 align:center
Later, we're defining an Event type
with name and date fields.


34
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,272 line:0
And we're conforming
to the CustomLoggable protocol,


35
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,809 line:0
by defining the getter
for the customLogString property.


36
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.247 line:-2 align:center
And this lets us pass
Event objects to our 'log' function.


37
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.450 line:-2 align:center
When we execute this code,
the 'log' function needs to check


38
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,553 line:-2
whether the value we passed
conforms to the protocol.


39
00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:04.024 line:-2 align:center
And it does that using the 'as' operator.
You may also have seen the 'is' operator.


40
00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:09.930 line:-2 align:center
Whenever possible, this check is optimized
away at build time, in the compiler.


41
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,767 line:-2
However, we don't always
have enough information yet.


42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,802 line:-2
So this often needs to happen
in the runtime,


43
00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:20.340 line:-2 align:center
with the help of protocol check metadata
we compute earlier.


44
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:23,810 line:-2
With this metadata, the runtime knows
whether this particular object


45
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,846 line:-1
really does conform to the protocol,


46
00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.581 line:-1 align:center
and the check succeeds.


47
00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:31.485 line:-2 align:center
Part of the metadata is built
at compile time,


48
00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.587 line:-2 align:center
but a lot can only be built
at launch time,


49
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.656 line:-1 align:center
particularly when using Generics.


50
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,761 line:-2
When you use a lot of protocols, this can
add up to hundreds of milliseconds.


51
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:45,599 line:-2
On real-world apps, we've seen this take
up to half of the launch time.


52
00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:48.869 line:-2 align:center
With the new Swift runtime,
we now precompute these ahead of time,


53
00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:51.538 line:-2 align:center
as part of the dyld closure
for the app executable


54
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,074 line:-1
and any dylib it uses at launch.


55
00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:56.877 line:-2 align:center
Best of all,
this is enabled even for existing apps


56
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.048 line:-2 align:center
when running on iOS 16, tvOS 16,
or watchOS 9.


57
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,684 line:0
If you'd like to learn more
about dyld and launch closures,


58
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,521 align:center
watch the talk "App Startup Time:
Past, Present, and Future."


59
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,389 line:0
That was protocol checks in Swift.


60
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,427 line:-1
Let's move on to message send.


61
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,197 line:-2
With the new compilers
and linker in Xcode 14,


62
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.833 line:-2 align:center
we've made message send calls
up to 8 bytes smaller,


63
00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:22.636 line:-1 align:center
down from 12, on ARM64.


64
00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.205 line:-2 align:center
As we'll see in just a moment,
message send is really everywhere,


65
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,607 line:-1
so this adds up,


66
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.811 line:-2 align:center
and we've seen up to 2% code size
improvements on binaries.


67
00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:33.714 line:-2 align:center
This is enabled automatically
when building with Xcode 14,


68
00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:38.051 line:-2 align:center
even if you use an older OS release
as deployment target.


69
00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:40.854 line:-2 align:center
It defaults to a balance
of size win and performance,


70
00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:43.223 line:-2 align:center
but you can opt into optimizing
for size only,


71
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:46,593 line:-1
using the objc_stubs_small linker flag.


72
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:49,496 line:-1
Now let's look into what changed.


73
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.831 line:-1 align:center
So let's start with an example.


74
00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:54.168 line:-2 align:center
Here we're trying to make an NSDate
for the start day of the conference.


75
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:56.303 line:-1 align:center
We start by making an NSCalendar,


76
00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.205 line:-1 align:center
then we fill out NSDateComponents,


77
00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.742 line:-2 align:center
make a date out of that,
and finally return it.


78
00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:05.012 line:-2 align:center
Now let's look at the assembly
the compiler generates.


79
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,314 line:-2
Now, the details of the assembly
aren't super important.


80
00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:11.018 line:-2 align:center
Us compiler folks stare at it all day
so that you don't have to.


81
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.820 line:-2 align:center
What's important is that
almost every line here


82
00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:16.690 line:-2 align:center
ends up needing an instruction
to call objc_msgSend,


83
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:21,628 line:-2
even when doing property accesses
like we do for the date components.


84
00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:24.464 line:-2 align:center
This is because at compile time,
we don't know which method to call,


85
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,834 line:-1
and it's only the objc runtime that does.


86
00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.002 line:-2 align:center
So we call into the runtime
using objc_msgSend


87
00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:32.039 line:-1 align:center
to ask it to find the right method.


88
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,608 line:-1
Let's focus on one of these calls.


89
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.411 line:-2 align:center
We already mentioned
the instruction to call objc_msgSend.


90
00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:38.745 line:-1 align:center
But there's more.


91
00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.614 line:-1 align:center
To tell the runtime which method to call,


92
00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:44.952 line:-2 align:center
we have to pass a selector
to these objc_msgSend calls.


93
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:48,422 line:-2
That needs a couple more instructions
to prepare the selector.


94
00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:52.292 line:-2 align:center
When we look at the binary, each of these
instructions takes a little bit of space.


95
00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:55.529 line:-1 align:center
On ARM64, that's 4 bytes each.


96
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:59,566 line:-2
So for each of these objc_msgSend calls,
we're using 12 bytes,


97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,602 line:-2
and we need that for every single one
of these calls;


98
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,505 line:-1
that really adds up.


99
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,473 line:-1
Let's see what we can do to improve that.


100
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,843 line:-1
Now, as we've seen before,


101
00:05:09.877 --> 00:05:13.447 line:-2 align:center
8 of those bytes are dedicated
to preparing the selector.


102
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,885 line:-2
Interesting thing is, for any given
selector, it's always the same code.


103
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,088 line:-2
And this is where
our optimization comes in.


104
00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.190 line:-2 align:center
Since this is always the same code,
we can share it


105
00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:25.292 line:-1 align:center
and only emit it once per selector


106
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,961 line:-2
instead of every time
we do a message send.


107
00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.797 line:-2 align:center
We can take it out and put it
into a little helper function,


108
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.534 line:-1 align:center
and call that function instead.


109
00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:35.702 line:-1 align:center
Over many calls using the same selector,


110
00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:38.338 line:-1 align:center
we can save all these instruction bytes.


111
00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:40.941 line:-2 align:center
We call this helper function
a "selector stub."


112
00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:45.245 line:-2 align:center
We still need to call the real
objc_msgSend function, though,


113
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,681 line:-1
so we continue onto that.


114
00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:51.084 line:-2 align:center
And again, that has another,
different, indirection to load the address


115
00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:53.520 line:-1 align:center
of the function itself and call it.


116
00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:55.989 line:-2 align:center
The details aren't important,
but what's important is that we need


117
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,192 line:-1
another several bytes of code to do that.


118
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,695 line:-2
And this is where you can choose
which mode you want,


119
00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:03.630 line:-1 align:center
as I mentioned earlier.


120
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:07,434 line:-2
We can either keep these two little stub
functions separate, like we've done here.


121
00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.636 line:-2 align:center
We get to share the most code,
and make these functions


122
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.905 line:-1 align:center
as small as possible.


123
00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.174 line:-2 align:center
But unfortunately,
this would do two calls back to back,


124
00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:17.444 line:-1 align:center
which is not ideal for performance.


125
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,781 line:-2
So we can further improve this
with an alternative version.


126
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:25,652 line:-2
We can take these two stub functions
we've created, combine them into one.


127
00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:29.156 line:-2 align:center
That way, we keep the code closer together
and we don't need as many calls.


128
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,124 line:-1
And that's on the right here.


129
00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:33.894 line:-1 align:center
So these are the two options.


130
00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:36.096 line:-2 align:center
You can choose whether
to optimize for size alone,


131
00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.765 line:-2 align:center
and get the maximum
size savings available.


132
00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:42.636 line:-2 align:center
You can enable that using
the -objc_stubs_small linker flag,


133
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,906 line:-2
or you can use the code generation
that provides size benefits


134
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,375 line:-1
while keeping the best performance.


135
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.345 line:-2 align:center
And unless you're severely
size-constrained, we recommend using this,


136
00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:54.181 line:-1 align:center
and that's why it's the default.


137
00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:57.050 line:-2 align:center
And that was smaller message send
using stubs.


138
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,488 line:-2
Another improvement we've made
is making retain/release cheaper.


139
00:07:01.522 --> 00:07:03.357 line:-1 align:center
With the new compilers in Xcode 14,


140
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.759 line:-2 align:center
retain/release calls are now
up to 4 bytes smaller,


141
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,629 line:-1
down from 8 on ARM64.


142
00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:11.131 line:-2 align:center
As we'll see in just a moment,
just like message send,


143
00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:13.000 line:-1 align:center
retain/release is also everywhere.


144
00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:18.539 line:-2 align:center
So this adds up, and we've seen up to 2%
more code size improvements on binaries.


145
00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:21.775 line:-2 align:center
Now, unlike message send stubs,
this does need runtime support,


146
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,545 line:-2
so you'll get this automatically
as you migrate to a deployment target


147
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:28,248 line:-1
of iOS 16, tvOS 16, or watchOS 9.


148
00:07:28.282 --> 00:07:31.018 line:-1 align:center
Now let's look into what changed.


149
00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:32.853 line:-1 align:center
Let's go back to our example.


150
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,055 line:-1
We talked about msgSend calls,


151
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,591 line:-2
but with automatic reference counting,
or ARC,


152
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,726 line:-2
we also end up with a lot
of retain/release calls


153
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,462 line:-1
inserted by the compiler.


154
00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:45.999 line:-2 align:center
At a very high level, whenever we make
a copy of a pointer to an object,


155
00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:49.102 line:-2 align:center
we need to increment
its retain count to keep it live.


156
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:53,707 line:-2
And here, this happens with our variables
cal, dateComponent, and theDate.


157
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.644 line:-2 align:center
We do that by calling into the runtime,
using objc_retain.


158
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,079 line:0
When the variables go out of scope,


159
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:03,383 line:0
we then need to decrement the retain count
using objc_release.


160
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:06,353 line:-2
Of course, part of the benefit of ARC
is all the compiler magic


161
00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:10.257 line:-2 align:center
that eliminates a lot of these calls,
to keep them to a minimum.


162
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,894 line:-2
And we're going to go into one
of these magic tricks a little bit later.


163
00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:17.898 line:-2 align:center
But even with all the magic,
we still often need these calls.


164
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:21,435 line:-2
In this example, we end up needing
to release our local copies of calendar


165
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,036 line:-1
and dateComponents.


166
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,474 line:-2
Under the hood,
these objc_retain/release functions


167
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,276 line:-1
are just plain C functions;


168
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,613 line:-2
take a single argument,
the object to be released.


169
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:36,049 line:-2
So with ARC, the compiler inserts calls
to these C functions,


170
00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:38.852 line:-1 align:center
passing the appropriate object pointers.


171
00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:42.189 line:-2 align:center
Because of that, these calls
have to respect the C calling convention,


172
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:46,093 line:-2
defined by our platform
Application Binary Interface, or ABI.


173
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,496 line:-2
Concretely, what that means
is that we need even more code


174
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.433 line:-2 align:center
to do these calls,
to pass the pointer in the right register.


175
00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:57.037 line:-2 align:center
So we end up with a few additional
'move' instructions just for that.


176
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,440 line:0
And that's where
our new optimization comes in.


177
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:03,877 line:0
By specializing retain/release
with a custom calling convention,


178
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,547 align:center
we can opportunistically use
the right variant


179
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,316 align:center
depending on where
the object pointer already is,


180
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,919 line:0
so that we don't need to move it.


181
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:15,455 align:center
Concretely, what this means is,
we get rid of a bunch of redundant code


182
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,124 align:center
for all these calls.


183
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,692 align:center
And again,
while this may not seem like much


184
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,494 line:0
for these puny little instructions,


185
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,530 align:center
over an entire app, it really adds up.


186
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,533 line:0
That's how we made retain/release
operations cheaper.


187
00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:29.870 line:-2 align:center
Finally,
let's talk about autorelease elision.


188
00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:32.339 line:-1 align:center
Now this one is even more interesting.


189
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:36,376 line:-2
With objc runtime changes,
we've made autorelease elision faster.


190
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.512 line:-2 align:center
That happens automatically
for existing apps


191
00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:41.548 line:-1 align:center
when you run them on the new OS releases.


192
00:09:41.582 --> 00:09:44.718 line:-2 align:center
Building on top of that,
with additional compiler changes,


193
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.321 line:-1 align:center
we also made the code smaller.


194
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,323 line:-2
And you'll get this size benefit
automatically


195
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:53,927 line:-2
as you migrate to a deployment target
of iOS 16, tvOS 16, or watchOS 9.


196
00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:59.600 line:-2 align:center
Now this is all great, but what's
autorelease elision in the first place?


197
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,102 line:-1
Let's go back to our example.


198
00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:05.072 line:-2 align:center
I mentioned earlier that ARC
already gives us a lot of compiler magic


199
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.040 line:-1 align:center
to optimize retains and releases.


200
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,909 line:-1
So let's focus on one case here:


201
00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.378 line:-1 align:center
autoreleased return values.


202
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:13.614 line:-2 align:center
In this example,
we made a temporary object,


203
00:10:13.647 --> 00:10:15.349 line:-1 align:center
and we're returning it to our caller.


204
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,951 line:-1
So let's look at how that works.


205
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,953 line:-1
So we have our temporary theDate,


206
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,889 line:-1
we return it, the call completes,


207
00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:24.825 line:-2 align:center
and the caller saves it
to its own variable.


208
00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:28.028 line:-1 align:center
So let's see how that works with ARC.


209
00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:32.232 line:-2 align:center
ARC inserts a retain in the caller,
and a release in the called function.


210
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:35,969 line:-2
Here, when we return our temporary object,
we need to release it first


211
00:10:36.003 --> 00:10:38.972 line:-2 align:center
in the function,
because it's going out of scope.


212
00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:43.343 line:-2 align:center
But we can't do that just yet, because
it doesn't have any other references yet.


213
00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:46.547 line:-2 align:center
If we did release it, it would be
destroyed before we even return,


214
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.048 line:-1 align:center
and that's no good.


215
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:51,952 line:-2
So a special convention is used
to be able to return the temporary.


216
00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:56.056 line:-2 align:center
We autorelease it before the return
so that the caller can then retain it.


217
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,992 line:-2
You've likely seen autorelease
and autoreleasepools before:


218
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:02,729 line:-2
it's simply a way to defer a release
until some later point.


219
00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:05.899 line:-2 align:center
Runtime doesn't really make any guarantees
as to when the release happens,


220
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:09,069 line:-2
but as long as it's not right here,
right now, it's convenient,


221
00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:12.039 line:-2 align:center
because it lets us
return this temporary object.


222
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,473 line:-1
Now, this isn't free.


223
00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:16.276 line:-2 align:center
There is some overhead
to doing an autorelease.


224
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.613 line:-2 align:center
This is where
autorelease elision comes in.


225
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,014 line:-1
So to understand how that works,


226
00:11:21.048 --> 00:11:24.518 line:-2 align:center
let's look at the assembly
and retrace this return.


227
00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:27.821 line:-2 align:center
When we call autorelease,
that goes into the objc runtime,


228
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,824 line:-1
and that's where the fun begins.


229
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,126 line:-2
The runtime tries to recognize
what's happening:


230
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.863 line:-2 align:center
that we're returning
an autoreleased value.


231
00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:38.332 line:-2 align:center
To help it out, the compiler emits
a special marker


232
00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:40.434 line:-1 align:center
that we never use otherwise.


233
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:45,405 line:-2
It's there to tell the runtime that this
is eligible for autorelease elision.


234
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,809 line:-2
And it's followed by the retain,
that we will execute later.


235
00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:50.644 line:-2 align:center
But right now,
we're still in the autorelease,


236
00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:54.781 line:-2 align:center
and when we do it, the runtime loads
the special marker instruction, as data,


237
00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:59.253 line:-2 align:center
and compares it to see if it is
the special marker value it expects.


238
00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:02.055 line:-2 align:center
If it is,
that means the compiler told the runtime


239
00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:05.192 line:-2 align:center
that we're returning a temporary
that will immediately be retained.


240
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,530 line:-2
And this lets us elide, or remove,
the matching autorelease and retain calls.


241
00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:11.498 line:-1 align:center
And that's autorelease elision.


242
00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:15.335 line:-1 align:center
However, this is not free either:


243
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:18,138 line:-2
loading code as data isn't something
that's super common otherwise,


244
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,174 line:-1
so it's not optimal on the CPUs.


245
00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:21.909 line:-1 align:center
We can do better.


246
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,977 line:-2
So let's retrace
the return sequence again,


247
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:26.747 line:-1 align:center
this time using the new way.


248
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,282 line:-1
We started at the autorelease.


249
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,817 line:-2
That still goes
into the Objective-C runtime.


250
00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:35.889 line:-2 align:center
At this point, we actually already have
valuable information: the return address.


251
00:12:35.923 --> 00:12:40.994 line:-2 align:center
It tells us where we need to return to
after this function completes execution.


252
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,963 line:-1
So we can keep track of that.


253
00:12:42.996 --> 00:12:45.165 line:-2 align:center
Thankfully, getting the return address
is very cheap.


254
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,535 line:-2
It's just a pointer,
and we can store it on the side.


255
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:51,371 line:-2
We then leave
the runtime autorelease call.


256
00:12:51.405 --> 00:12:52.973 line:-1 align:center
We return to the caller,


257
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:56,376 line:-2
and we re-enter the runtime
when doing the retain.


258
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.947 line:-2 align:center
And this is where
the new bit of magic happens.


259
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,982 line:-1
At that point, we can look at where we are


260
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,885 line:-2
and get a pointer
to our current return address.


261
00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:07.588 line:-2 align:center
In the runtime,
we can compare this pointer we just got


262
00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:09.990 line:-2 align:center
while doing the retain
with the one we saved earlier


263
00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:12.226 line:-1 align:center
when we were doing the autorelease.


264
00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:13.660 line:-2 align:center
And since we're
just comparing two pointers,


265
00:13:13.694 --> 00:13:14.795 line:-1 align:center
this is super cheap.


266
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,764 line:-2
We don't need to do
expensive memory accesses.


267
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,133 line:-2
If the comparison succeeds,
we know we can elide


268
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,535 line:-1
the autorelease/retain pair,


269
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,004 line:-1
and we get to improve some performance.


270
00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:27.241 line:-2 align:center
And on top of that,
now that we don't need to compare


271
00:13:27.274 --> 00:13:29.510 line:-2 align:center
this special marker instruction
as data anymore,


272
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,212 line:-1
we don't need it, so we can remove it.


273
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,948 line:-2
And that lets us
save some code size as well.


274
00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:38.051 line:-2 align:center
That's how we made autorelease elision
faster and smaller.


275
00:13:38.685 --> 00:13:41.989 line:-2 align:center
We went through several Swift
and Objective-C runtime improvements.


276
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,690 line:-1
Let's wrap up.


277
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:45,692 line:-1
When your app is run on the new OS,


278
00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:47.728 line:-2 align:center
thanks to the improvements
in the runtimes,


279
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:50.597 line:-1 align:center
Swift protocol checks are more efficient.


280
00:13:50.631 --> 00:13:54.968 line:-2 align:center
Every time we try to do
autorelease elision, that's faster too.


281
00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:58.805 line:-2 align:center
Thanks to the new compilers and linker
in Xcode 14 and message send stubs,


282
00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:02.843 line:-2 align:center
you can save up to 2% of code size
by rebuilding your app.


283
00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:06.880 line:-2 align:center
And finally, when you update
your deployment target to iOS 16, tvOS 16,


284
00:14:06.914 --> 00:14:10.384 line:-2 align:center
or watchOS 9,
you can further save another 2%


285
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,286 line:-1
by making retain/release calls smaller.


286
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:16,356 line:-2
Even more, thanks to the smaller
autorelease elision sequence.


287
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,893 line:-2
I hope you enjoyed this deep dive
into the Swift and Objective-C runtimes,


288
00:14:19.927 --> 00:14:21.361 line:-1 align:center
and thanks for watching.
