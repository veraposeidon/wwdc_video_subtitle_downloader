Susan Prescott: Welcome
to the Platform State of the Union


5
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,895 line:-1
for WWDC 2022.


6
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:31,532 line:0
We're always excited for WWDC
because it's an opportunity


7
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,634 line:0
for us to connect with all of you,


8
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,636 line:-2
share some news
about what we've been working on,


9
00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:39.973 line:-2 align:center
and better understand what you need
from our developer platforms.


10
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,510 line:-1
What you do as developers is amazing.


11
00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:48.048 line:-2 align:center
You transform your ideas,
the stuff of imagination,


12
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.618 line:-2 align:center
to take users' experiences
to another level.


13
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:55,489 line:-2
And we want to help you
take your ideas even further.


14
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,625 line:-2
In the Keynote, we already talked
about some new capabilities


15
00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.360 line:-1 align:center
across iPhone, iPad, Mac,


16
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,329 line:-1
Apple Watch, and Apple TV,


17
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,299 line:-2
and the incredible power
of Apple silicon


18
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:09,102 line:-2
to help bring even the most ambitious
ideas to life.


19
00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:13.273 line:-2 align:center
We have a lot to cover today.
Let's start with some updates.


20
00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:17.711 line:-2 align:center
Earlier this year, we opened
the brand-new Apple Developer Center,


21
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,614 line:-2
a place designed for you to connect
and collaborate


22
00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:24.518 line:-2 align:center
with Apple engineers and designers
right here at Apple Park.


23
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:28.488 line:-2 align:center
And last fall, thousands of you
from all over the world


24
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,691 line:-1
attended our new online Tech Talks,


25
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:34,361 line:-2
with hundreds of live sessions
originating in 11 countries


26
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,496 line:-1
and in five languages.


27
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.932 line:-2 align:center
For us, one of the best parts
of the Tech Talk series


28
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.334 line:-1 align:center
was one to one meetings,


29
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,904 line:-2
which were a great opportunity
to hear about what you're up to


30
00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:46.807 line:-1 align:center
and share some advice and guidance.


31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,376 line:-1
Last fall, Swift Playgrounds 4 shipped


32
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,280 line:-2
with the power to build apps and submit
them directly to the App Store


33
00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.182 line:-1 align:center
and support for SwiftUI,


34
00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:59.686 line:-2 align:center
making it an incredible tool for
experimentation and UI prototyping.


35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,523 line:-1
And of course, there's Xcode Cloud.


36
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,157 line:-1
We built Xcode Cloud to help you


37
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:07.327 line:-2 align:center
build better apps
faster and more easily.


38
00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:09.663 line:-2 align:center
It's a continuous integration
and delivery service


39
00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:14.268 line:-2 align:center
built right into Xcode
and hosted in the Cloud.


40
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,238 line:-2
Xcode Cloud supports development
for all Apple platforms.


41
00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:21.175 line:-2 align:center
It integrates with TestFlight
and App Store Connect


42
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,578 line:-2
as well as every major git based
source control provider.


43
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:28.015 line:-2 align:center
It even has REST APIs
to help connect to other aspects


44
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,483 line:-1
of your development workflow.


45
00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:34.154 line:-2 align:center
It's built with advanced security
to protect you and your projects.


46
00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:36.557 line:-1 align:center
And I'm delighted to say


47
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,892 line:-1
that Xcode Cloud is available


48
00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:40.527 line:-1 align:center
starting today.


49
00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:44.031 line:-1 align:center
We think nearly every development team


50
00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:45.732 line:-1 align:center
can benefit from Xcode Cloud,


51
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,937 line:-2
and we've priced it to be accessible
to developers of all sizes.


52
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.273 line:-2 align:center
We're offering
the 25 hour per month subscription


53
00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:59.179 line:-2 align:center
free to all Apple Developer Program
members through the end of 2023!


54
00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:03.217 line:-2 align:center
And you'll be able to subscribe to any
of the Xcode Cloud subscription levels


55
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.353 line:-1 align:center
in the Developer app later this Summer.


56
00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:10.824 line:-2 align:center
Today we're gonna talk
about three big topics.


57
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:15,796 line:-2
First, we want to share more about our
vision for developing for Apple platforms,


58
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,600 line:-2
where we are with our platforms,
and where we're headed.


59
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:23,237 line:-2
Then, we'll share some compelling
new ways your apps can integrate


60
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.340 line:-2 align:center
with the system experience
on Apple platforms.


61
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:30,244 line:-2
And finally,
we'll discuss some powerful new APIs


62
00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:33.847 line:-2 align:center
and show you how they can enable you
to do even more ambitious things


63
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:34.882 line:-1 align:center
with your apps.


64
00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:37.784 line:-2 align:center
Let's start with the vision
for our developer platform


65
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,286 line:-1
and how it's been evolving.


66
00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.822 line:-1 align:center
Josh is here to tell you all about it.,


67
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,760 line:-2
Josh Shaffer: A great developer platform
provides tight integration


68
00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:49.897 line:-2 align:center
between programming language,
frameworks and tools.


69
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,432 line:0
When all three
fully complement one another,


70
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,068 line:0
we can ensure that common things are easy,


71
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,337 line:0
and even uncommon things are possible.


72
00:03:57.938 --> 00:04:01.375 line:-2 align:center
Now, getting that right shortens the path
to building a great app,


73
00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.410 line:-1 align:center
and it benefits everyone.


74
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,146 line:-1
Customers get a consistent experience,


75
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,916 line:-1
like scrolling that always feels perfect.


76
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:13,620 line:-2
And you're able to focus your time
and effort on what makes your app unique.


77
00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:16.657 line:-1 align:center
But designs evolve, hardware advances,


78
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.561 line:-2 align:center
and what was once cutting edge
becomes the expected baseline.


79
00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:24.064 line:-2 align:center
The Objective-C language,
AppKit & UIKit frameworks,


80
00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:28.001 line:-2 align:center
and Interface Builder
have empowered generations of developers.


81
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,571 line:-2
These technologies
were built for each other,


82
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,907 line:-2
and will continue to serve us well
for a long time to come,


83
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:37.611 line:-2 align:center
but over time
new abstractions become necessary.


84
00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:41.648 line:-2 align:center
For a while now, you've seen us
hard at work defining the next generation


85
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:45,185 line:-2
of integrated language,
frameworks, and tools:


86
00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:49.089 line:-1 align:center
Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode Previews.


87
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:52,659 line:-2
Tight integration
in a development platform like this


88
00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:56.563 line:-2 align:center
requires that all three pieces
be designed and evolved together,


89
00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:59.666 line:-1 align:center
both driving and driven by one another.


90
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,972 line:-2
Swift result builders were inspired
by SwiftUI's compositional structure.


91
00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:10.110 line:-2 align:center
SwiftUI's declarative views
were enabled by Swift value types.


92
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:15.916 line:-2 align:center
And Xcode Previews was specifically
designed for, and enabled by, both.


93
00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.120 line:-2 align:center
Now, the result is the best development
platform that we have ever built.


94
00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:25.626 line:-2 align:center
And this year, Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode
all have fantastic updates


95
00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.661 line:-1 align:center
that take this vision further,


96
00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:31.965 line:-2 align:center
and make it even easier for you to build
great apps for all of our platforms.


97
00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.134 line:-1 align:center
And it all starts with Swift.


98
00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:37.938 line:-2 align:center
Now Ben from the Swift team
is gonna tell you all about what's next.


99
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:48,115 line:-1
♪ ♪


100
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,120 line:-2
Ben Cohen:
Swift is fast, modern, and safe.


101
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,156 align:center
It combines the speed
of a strongly-typed language,


102
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,193 align:center
with an expressive syntax
that's easy to read and write.


103
00:05:59.226 --> 00:06:03.163 line:-2 align:center
And its design eliminates
entire categories of programming errors.


104
00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:07.267 line:-2 align:center
Swift is the absolute best language
for building apps across our devices.


105
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,736 line:-1
Swift is also open source,


106
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.638 line:-1 align:center
with an amazing community of contributors


107
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,607 line:-1
organized at swift.org,


108
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,743 line:-2
supporting one another through
initiatives like Diversity in Swift


109
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,412 line:-1
and the Swift Mentorship Program,


110
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,147 line:-1
and advancing the language


111
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.716 line:-2 align:center
with working groups on topics
like Swift on server,


112
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,585 line:-1
and C++ interoperability.


113
00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:28.121 line:-2 align:center
Over the last year,
Swift has gotten even better,


114
00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:30.424 line:-1 align:center
with enhancements in concurrency,


115
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,460 line:-2
upgrades to make Swift code
easier to read and write,


116
00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:35.529 line:-2 align:center
tooling to help you
customize your workflow,


117
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,131 line:-1
and amazing under-the-hood improvements.


118
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,666 line:-1
It started last year,


119
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,735 line:-2
with the introduction
of Swift Concurrency.


120
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:46,073 line:-2
Swift Concurrency dramatically simplified
reading and writing code


121
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,009 line:-2
that runs in parallel,
and has been a huge hit,


122
00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:50.978 line:-2 align:center
with more than 40,000 apps
in the App Store


123
00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:52.980 line:-1 align:center
adopting it in just the first year.


124
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:56,383 line:-2
Because it's such a fundamental
and important improvement


125
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,118 line:-1
to your app's code base,


126
00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:00.621 line:-2 align:center
it's now possible to deploy code
with Swift Concurrency


127
00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:04.625 line:-2 align:center
to all operating systems
released in the last three years.


128
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:08,729 line:-2
Swift Concurrency also introduced
async sequences.


129
00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.431 line:-2 align:center
This year, there's a new,
open-source package


130
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:15,769 line:-2
that brings concurrency to Swift's
rich set of existing sequence algorithms.


131
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,138 line:-1
It's called async algorithms.


132
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:20,307 line:-2
For example,
where Swift's sequence protocol


133
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.610 line:-2 align:center
supports a zip algorithm
to combine two sequences,


134
00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:26.446 line:-2 align:center
async algorithms brings a version
for zipping together


135
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.282 line:-1 align:center
two asynchronous sequences.


136
00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:32.085 line:-2 align:center
Because async sequences are integrated
directly into the Swift language,


137
00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:34.955 line:-2 align:center
they use familiar constructs
like 'for' loops


138
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,024 line:-1
that, thanks to the async/await syntax,


139
00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:39.026 line:-1 align:center
looks like regular straight-line code.


140
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,062 line:-2
You're also able to use
the familiar try/catch pattern


141
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,031 line:-1
to handle things like network failures


142
00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:46.834 line:-2 align:center
from asynchronous data streaming
over the network.


143
00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:49.570 line:-1 align:center
A key thing about async sequences


144
00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:52.172 line:-1 align:center
is how they deliver data values over time.


145
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,511 line:-2
Swift now includes a new set of
clock types for representing time units,


146
00:07:57.544 --> 00:08:01.882 line:-2 align:center
and async algorithms builds on them
to provide many time-based algorithms,


147
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,383 line:-1
like throttle here,


148
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:06,987 line:-2
which can help slow down updates
from a sequence.


149
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.391 line:-2 align:center
Swift's concurrency model is designed
to make asynchronous code as easy


150
00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:14.161 line:-2 align:center
and safe to write
as your synchronous code.


151
00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:17.064 line:-1 align:center
A big part of that is Swift's actor model.


152
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,000 line:-1
Actors allow you to isolate your data


153
00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:23.537 line:-2 align:center
using thread-safe,
concurrently-executing code.


154
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.440 line:-2 align:center
Swift prevents you from
accidentally sharing that state


155
00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:27.941 line:-1 align:center
between parallel threads,


156
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,511 line:-1
defining away a major source of bugs.


157
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:35,849 line:-2
Communication between actors is
easy and efficient through async/await.


158
00:08:35.883 --> 00:08:39.653 line:-2 align:center
Now, Swift takes the idea
of actor isolation further


159
00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.421 line:-1 align:center
with distributed actors.


160
00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:46.059 line:-2 align:center
Distributed actors can communicate
across multiple processes or devices.


161
00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:49.129 line:-2 align:center
The "distributed" keyword
marks these actors


162
00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:51.632 line:-1 align:center
and methods that can be accessed remotely,


163
00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:54.735 line:-2 align:center
whether that's between
separate processes on your Mac,


164
00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:57.104 line:-1 align:center
peer to peer between different devices,


165
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:00,741 line:-2
or from a device talking to your backend
written with Swift on Server.


166
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:05,012 line:-2
Just as actors help Swift
protect your state data


167
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.280 line:-1 align:center
from race conditions,


168
00:09:06.313 --> 00:09:10.551 line:-2 align:center
distributed actors help Swift make them
available outside your process,


169
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,986 line:-1
using a pluggable transport mechanism.


170
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,657 line:-2
The Swift compiler can then
perform checks that help guarantee


171
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,359 line:-2
correct behavior
in a distributed environment,


172
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:23,063 line:-2
allowing you to get back to working
on the features that you care about.


173
00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:26.600 line:-2 align:center
Distributed actors
and other concurrency features


174
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:30,070 line:-2
show just how easy Swift code can be
to read and write


175
00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:33.307 line:-2 align:center
when enhancements
are crafted deep within the syntax.


176
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,543 line:-2
To tell you more
about usability enhancements in Swift,


177
00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:37.878 line:-1 align:center
here's Ken.


178
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,781 line:-2
Ken Orr: Strings are one
of the most important features


179
00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:42.516 line:-1 align:center
of any programming language.


180
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,853 align:center
But dealing with strings can
be a common source of frustration.


181
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,522 align:center
At some point in a developer's journey,


182
00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:50.824 line:-2 align:center
they may find themselves
needing to extract information


183
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:52,359 line:-1
from a string like this.


184
00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:56.997 line:-2 align:center
Writing code to parse the string
is easy to get wrong,


185
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,999 line:-1
with many details to track.


186
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:02,135 line:-2
And the resulting code–
it's hard to read and modify.


187
00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:06.673 line:-2 align:center
Regular expressions are a powerful
solution to this challenge.


188
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:10,010 line:-2
They allow you to describe the pattern
you expect to see in your string


189
00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:14.114 line:-2 align:center
and specify which pieces of information
you're interested in capturing.


190
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:18,685 line:-2
This year, Swift is delivering a huge
improvement to the developer experience


191
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,587 line:-1
around regular expressions,


192
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,590 line:-2
starting with
a new regular expression literal.


193
00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:26.593 line:-1 align:center
They're built directly into the language,


194
00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:29.062 line:-2 align:center
allowing the Swift compiler
to check for correctness.


195
00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:31.865 line:-2 align:center
And they unlock the power
of Swift's type system


196
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,334 line:-2
when you're extracting information
with a regular expression.


197
00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:39.406 line:-2 align:center
And they take full advantage
of Swift's best-in-class Unicode support.


198
00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:41.108 line:-1 align:center
Let's take a look.


199
00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.809 line:-2 align:center
I'm working on an app
called Food Truck


200
00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:46.613 line:-2 align:center
that organizes everything
from taking orders to tracking sales.


201
00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:49.583 line:-2 align:center
And some orders come in as strings,
packed with data.


202
00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:53.320 line:-2 align:center
Now, regular expressions are perfect
for extracting the details I want,


203
00:10:53.353 --> 00:10:57.057 line:-2 align:center
and there's no better place to experiment
with them than here in a Playground.


204
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.126 line:-1 align:center
I'll start by creating a regex literal.


205
00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:02.429 line:-1 align:center
Now I'll type the expression,


206
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,498 line:-1
and pull out who made the order,


207
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:06.066 line:-1 align:center
the donut type,


208
00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:08.168 line:-1 align:center
and the number of donuts.


209
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:10,971 line:-2
Now, as I type,
the regex is syntax highlighted,


210
00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:14.241 line:-2 align:center
which helps me confirm
my expression is correct.


211
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,142 line:-1
Now I'll try it out.


212
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.178 line:-1 align:center
Use the order string from above


213
00:11:18.212 --> 00:11:20.547 line:-1 align:center
and look for the first match of the regex.


214
00:11:21.682 --> 00:11:24.518 line:-2 align:center
Now, when I run the Playground,
I can see with the inline result


215
00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:28.488 line:-2 align:center
exactly what parts of the order string
the regex matches.


216
00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:31.458 line:-2 align:center
And here, it's finding
just what I was looking for.


217
00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:34.862 line:-2 align:center
Swift's new regex support
doesn't stop here.


218
00:11:34.895 --> 00:11:36.597 line:-1 align:center
As literals become more complex,


219
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,833 line:-2
like this one
that matches parts of a log file,


220
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:43,871 line:-2
Swift offers an even better way
to craft these patterns–


221
00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:45.506 line:-1 align:center
regex builders.


222
00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:49.776 line:-2 align:center
And it's easy
to convert a literal to a builder.


223
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,379 line:-1
Now I have code,


224
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,816 line:-2
and that makes it easier
to read and change.


225
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,619 line:-1
I can simplify this one even more.


226
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,054 line:-1
Here, where I'm looking for a hex digit,


227
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,590 line:-1
I'll use the new .hexDigit CharacterClass,


228
00:12:03.624 --> 00:12:06.693 line:-1 align:center
helping making my intent even clearer.


229
00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:09.730 line:-2 align:center
Now, the builder syntax makes it
so much easier for me to create


230
00:12:09.763 --> 00:12:12.065 line:-1 align:center
and extend my expressions,


231
00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:14.768 line:-1 align:center
and get the results I'm looking for.


232
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:17.304 line:-2 align:center
And that's the powerful,
new developer experience


233
00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:19.907 line:-1 align:center
around regular expressions in Swift.


234
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.277 line:-2 align:center
Ben: Beyond string syntax,
Swift is also getting easier


235
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:28.315 line:-2 align:center
to read and write through improvements
to a language feature known as generics.


236
00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:30.951 line:-2 align:center
Generics power features of Swift
you use every day,


237
00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:32.319 line:-1 align:center
like the Array type,


238
00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:36.023 line:-2 align:center
which holds any kind of element,
from strings to your own custom types.


239
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:39,293 line:-2
Generic code uses the concept
of a placeholder type


240
00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:42.796 line:-2 align:center
to stand in for another type
to be determined later.


241
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:45.666 line:-2 align:center
By removing assumptions
about specific types,


242
00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:48.302 line:-2 align:center
you can be more clear
about the intent of your code,


243
00:12:48.335 --> 00:12:50.838 line:-1 align:center
and make it easier to re-use.


244
00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:53.540 line:-2 align:center
But this can also make your code
harder to read.


245
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,711 line:-2
For example, if you wanted to handle
a generic collection of songs


246
00:12:57.744 --> 00:12:59.112 line:-1 align:center
as a function parameter,


247
00:12:59.146 --> 00:13:02.516 line:-2 align:center
you'd have to write quite a bit
of code to express your intent.


248
00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:07.287 line:-2 align:center
Now in Swift, writing a function
that accepts some collection of songs


249
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:12,259 line:-2
is as easy as using the 'some' keyword
to tell Swift about the parameter.


250
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,796 line:-2
You get the same meaning,
but with less code.


251
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,399 line:-2
In other cases,
you might need more dynamic behavior,


252
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:22,436 line:-2
like with this music library's
array of playlists,


253
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,973 line:-2
which might need to contain different
types of collections of songs–


254
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,742 line:-1
sets of songs, or arrays of songs.


255
00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:31.512 line:-2 align:center
That's where the new 'any' keyword
can help.


256
00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:33.780 line:-2 align:center
The 'any' keyword
is built right into Swift,


257
00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:38.252 line:-2 align:center
and allows you to express a type
that can hold any collection of songs.


258
00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:41.588 line:-2 align:center
And it works seamlessly
with generic functions too.


259
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:45,559 line:-2
By adopting familiar syntax
and using more natural keywords,


260
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:48,929 line:-2
writing generic code in Swift
has never been easier.


261
00:13:48.962 --> 00:13:52.733 line:-2 align:center
Just as important as the features
built into the Swift language


262
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:55,135 line:-1
are the tools built around it.


263
00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:59.039 line:-2 align:center
The Swift Package Manager makes it easy
to manage your app's dependencies


264
00:13:59.072 --> 00:14:01.341 line:-2 align:center
and take advantage
of the fantastic packages


265
00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:03.977 line:-1 align:center
published by developers around the world.


266
00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:08.215 line:-2 align:center
To date, those developers have
published thousands of Swift packages,


267
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,919 line:-2
providing code to help with everything
from authentication and web services


268
00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:15.222 line:-2 align:center
to data management
and reusable UI components.


269
00:14:15.255 --> 00:14:18.725 line:-2 align:center
And this year, the Swift Package Manager
is amplifying the ways


270
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,163 line:-2
you can create and build code
with all-new Package Plugins.


271
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:26,667 line:-2
Plugins are Swift packages
you can add to your project


272
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,169 line:-1
as easily as any other dependency.


273
00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:32.606 line:-2 align:center
They download and build
automatically on a fresh checkout,


274
00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:35.275 line:-1 align:center
except instead of being code in your app,


275
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,010 line:-1
they're code that helps build your app.


276
00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:41.548 line:-2 align:center
Package Plugins can be invoked
from the command line or within Xcode,


277
00:14:41.582 --> 00:14:44.852 line:-2 align:center
either as part of your build phase
or on-demand.


278
00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:46.920 line:-1 align:center
They run in a sandbox environment


279
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:50,424 line:-2
which prompts you for permission
before reading or modifying your code.


280
00:14:51.124 --> 00:14:53.660 line:-2 align:center
There are endless possibilities
for extending your workflow


281
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:54,695 line:-1
with Package Plugins.


282
00:14:54.728 --> 00:14:57.331 line:-2 align:center
You could use them to lint
and format your code


283
00:14:57.364 --> 00:14:58.765 line:-1 align:center
to match the team style guide


284
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,168 line:-2
with packages
like SwiftLint or SwiftFormat


285
00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:03.704 line:-2 align:center
or automatically generate source code
at build-time


286
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,205 line:-1
with tools like Sourcery.


287
00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:07.441 line:-1 align:center
Anything that helps you get the job done.


288
00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:10.944 line:-2 align:center
Ken: Package Plugins are a great way
to extend Xcode,


289
00:15:10.978 --> 00:15:13.180 line:-1 align:center
just by writing a little Swift.


290
00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:14.815 line:-1 align:center
And you can do that in two ways.


291
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:17,751 line:-2
With command plugins
that you use on demand,


292
00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:20.921 line:-2 align:center
and with build plugins
for whenever your project builds.


293
00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:22.956 line:-1 align:center
Now, back here in our Food Truck app,


294
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.259 line:-2 align:center
here's the code for a command plugin
I created.


295
00:15:26.894 --> 00:15:30.163 line:-1 align:center
My team has a unique code aesthetic.


296
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:33,000 line:-2
We like our imports
sorted in string length order.


297
00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:35.035 line:-1 align:center
Shortest to longest.


298
00:15:35.068 --> 00:15:38.906 line:-2 align:center
And since Package Plugins are
all about customization and control,


299
00:15:38.939 --> 00:15:42.342 line:-2 align:center
we created a command plugin that uses
SwiftFormat to take care of that.


300
00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:46.079 line:-1 align:center
It finds all the locally modified files,


301
00:15:46.113 --> 00:15:48.415 line:-1 align:center
and then it sorts their imports.


302
00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:52.519 line:-2 align:center
Now, here's a file I've been editing
with some unsorted imports at the top.


303
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:55,255 line:-2
I'll use the command
on the entire project.


304
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,792 line:-2
I can select any number of targets.
I'll run it on everything.


305
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,562 line:-2
And I can review
the plugin's code if I want.


306
00:16:01.595 --> 00:16:03.063 line:-2 align:center
I'm all set.
I'll run the command.


307
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.733 line:-2 align:center
And then, just like that,
the plugin goes to work on my files.


308
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,337 line:-2
It finds all of the locally modified
source files,


309
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.773 line:-1 align:center
and then it sorts them in length order.


310
00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.809 line:-2 align:center
With plugins,
you can go beyond just formatting.


311
00:16:15.843 --> 00:16:18.679 line:-2 align:center
You can generate source code,
work with git,


312
00:16:18.712 --> 00:16:21.715 line:-2 align:center
even surface your own custom errors
and warnings.


313
00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:25.319 line:-2 align:center
I have another plugin to make sure
my code is well documented.


314
00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:29.389 line:-2 align:center
It's a build plugin, and it's based on
the open source SwiftLint package.


315
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,994 line:-2
So now when I build, I can easily see
all the places in my code


316
00:16:34.027 --> 00:16:36.463 line:-1 align:center
where I need to add documentation.


317
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:40,267 line:-2
And build plugins extend
all the way to Xcode Cloud,


318
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,870 line:-1
where they run as part of every build.


319
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,638 line:-1
With Swift package plugins,


320
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,974 line:-1
my team and I can create our own commands,


321
00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.943 line:-2 align:center
customize builds locally
and in Xcode Cloud,


322
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:52,212 line:-1
and then share those plugins with others.


323
00:16:52.246 --> 00:16:55.449 line:-2 align:center
All using the power
of a few lines of Swift.


324
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,885 line:-2
And that's a quick look
at the ways Package Plugins


325
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:00,487 line:-1
can level up your development workflow.


326
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,591 line:-2
Ben: Finally, Swift has some impressive
changes under the hood.


327
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,560 line:-2
Building Swift projects
is quicker than ever.


328
00:17:06.593 --> 00:17:08.795 line:-1 align:center
Thanks to new parallelization efforts,


329
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.131 line:-1 align:center
link time is up to twice as fast.


330
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,000 line:-1
And the Swift concurrency runtime


331
00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:15.769 line:-1 align:center
is now more tightly integrated with the OS


332
00:17:15.802 --> 00:17:18.939 line:-2 align:center
to better ensure the priority
of your asynchronous tasks,


333
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:21,441 line:-2
helping your apps
stay efficient and responsive.


334
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:26,680 line:-2
Lastly, launch time for apps written
in Swift is dramatically faster on iOS 16,


335
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,851 line:-2
with apps like Lyft or Airbnb
launching almost twice as fast


336
00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:33.086 line:-2 align:center
thanks to improvement
in the dynamic linker.


337
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,322 line:-1
With these under-the-hood improvements,


338
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,990 line:-1
new abilities in tooling,


339
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:40,027 line:-2
an evolved syntax
that's easier to read and write,


340
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,895 line:-1
and improvements in concurrency,


341
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:44,831 line:-2
there has never been a better time
to develop in Swift.


342
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:49,803 line:-2
Swift is the absolute best language
for building apps across our devices.


343
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:53,640 line:-2
But a language is just part of what
you need to build your best apps.


344
00:17:53.674 --> 00:17:57.644 line:-2 align:center
You have to pair a language with
a powerful user interface framework.


345
00:17:57,678 --> 00:17:59,813 line:-1
And Eliza is gonna tell you more.


346
00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:02.816 line:-2 align:center
Eliza Block: A powerful UI framework
provides abstractions


347
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,319 align:center
that make it easy
to describe your interface,


348
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:08,355 align:center
to populate it with data,
and to keep it up to date.


349
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,657 line:-1
It should scale well with complexity.


350
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:13,227 line:-2
And it should be designed
for the platform you're targeting,


351
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.996 line:-2 align:center
giving you full access
to the power of the device.


352
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:21.034 line:-2 align:center
Your UI framework should help you make
your app feel familiar and intuitive.


353
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,871 line:-2
It should make it easy to create
standard controls


354
00:18:23.904 --> 00:18:25.639 line:-1 align:center
and native interaction patterns,


355
00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:28.242 line:-1 align:center
with options for advanced customization.


356
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,644 line:-1
And it needs to have an expressive API


357
00:18:30.677 --> 00:18:33.580 line:-2 align:center
that allows you to quickly prototype
your ideas


358
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:36,016 line:-2
and see the results
across a range of devices.


359
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,152 align:center
SwiftUI offers all this and more.


360
00:18:39.186 --> 00:18:42.623 line:-2 align:center
Like Swift,
Swift UI is designed with strong opinions


361
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:44,658 line:-1
about the best way to build apps.


362
00:18:44.691 --> 00:18:48.462 line:-2 align:center
It has a declarative syntax
that's easy to read and write.


363
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:52,933 line:-2
You describe what your interface
looks like, instead of how to build it.


364
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:57,504 line:-2
And this leaves room for SwiftUI
to provide intelligent defaults


365
00:18:57.538 --> 00:18:59.606 line:-1 align:center
for each platform.


366
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.944 line:-2 align:center
SwiftUI automatically keeps your interface
up-to-date with changes


367
00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:05.579 line:-1 align:center
to the underlying data model,


368
00:19:05.612 --> 00:19:08.916 line:-2 align:center
so your app's UI never ends up
in an inconsistent state.


369
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,320 line:-1
SwiftUI handles all these details for you,


370
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:17,391 line:-2
so you can focus your time and energy
on what makes your app unique.


371
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:21,028 line:-2
Writing a new UI framework
is a huge undertaking.


372
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:23,931 line:-2
Since its introduction
we've been continually expanding


373
00:19:23.964 --> 00:19:27.167 line:-2 align:center
SwiftUI's API coverage,
guided by your feedback.


374
00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:31.772 line:-2 align:center
This year we've made it even easier
to adopt SwiftUI incrementally


375
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,173 line:-1
in your existing apps,


376
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:37,377 line:-2
and we've made some exciting enhancements
to its power and flexibility,


377
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:39,780 line:-1
starting with app navigation.


378
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,482 line:-2
With SwiftUI,
it has always been easy to create


379
00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:46.453 line:-2 align:center
the common kinds of navigation
hierarchies found in many apps.


380
00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:49.690 line:-2 align:center
And this year,
SwiftUI is expanding that support


381
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:52,292 line:-1
with an all-new navigation API.


382
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.897 line:-2 align:center
The new navigation API makes it easy
to express the style of navigation


383
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.633 line:-1 align:center
that best fits the needs of your app.


384
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:03,770 line:-2
With robust programmatic control
over the presentation of your app's views,


385
00:20:03.804 --> 00:20:06.540 line:-1 align:center
you can easily save and restore selection,


386
00:20:06.573 --> 00:20:10.344 line:-2 align:center
and even replace the full contents
of a navigation stack.


387
00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:13.480 line:-2 align:center
This is really useful
when handling important behaviors


388
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:15,716 line:-1
like setting the launch state of your app,


389
00:20:15.749 --> 00:20:18.552 line:-1 align:center
managing transitions between size classes,


390
00:20:18.585 --> 00:20:20.220 line:-1 align:center
and responding to deep links.


391
00:20:21.154 --> 00:20:24.892 line:-2 align:center
SwiftUI also has huge improvements
when it comes to controlling


392
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:27,094 line:-1
the layout of your app's interface.


393
00:20:27.828 --> 00:20:32.065 line:-2 align:center
The layout of many app interfaces
can be described using SwiftUI's model


394
00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:34.868 line:-2 align:center
of horizontal
or vertical stacks of elements.


395
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,571 line:-2
And while this model works
for many common layouts,


396
00:20:37.604 --> 00:20:40.340 line:-2 align:center
sometimes
you need something more flexible.


397
00:20:40.374 --> 00:20:43.243 line:-1 align:center
This year, we're adding a new Grid API,


398
00:20:43.277 --> 00:20:45.779 line:-2 align:center
which makes it easier
to lay out a set of views


399
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,582 line:-1
aligned across multiple rows and columns.


400
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,118 line:-1
And you can take your layouts even further


401
00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:54.154 line:-1 align:center
with the all-new custom layout API.


402
00:20:54.188 --> 00:20:57.157 line:-2 align:center
The custom layout API
gives you the flexibility


403
00:20:57.191 --> 00:20:59.760 line:-1 align:center
to build any type of layout you want.


404
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:02,029 line:-2
For example,
you could create a flow layout


405
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:05,465 line:-2
where your views are arranged
like the content of a newspaper,


406
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:08,569 line:-2
wrapping to the next column
when more space is needed.


407
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:12,573 line:-2
Or you could create a radial layout
that draws your views in a circle,


408
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,107 line:-1
like the numbers on a watch face.


409
00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:19.546 line:-2 align:center
The custom layout API makes it easy
to re-use your layout logic,


410
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.349 line:-2 align:center
making your view code simpler
and easier to read.


411
00:21:22.382 --> 00:21:25.352 line:-2 align:center
SwiftUI continues to grow
to offer


412
00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:27.688 line:-1 align:center
many more types of interface elements.


413
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:30,858 line:-2
Like half sheets,
which define secondary views


414
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:32,759 line:-1
that slide above a main view.


415
00:21:32.793 --> 00:21:37.564 line:-2 align:center
These are great to provide quick access
to information on smaller screens.


416
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:40,100 line:-1
And SwiftUI now supports Share Sheets,


417
00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:41.835 line:-1 align:center
so your app can easily leverage


418
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:45,005 line:-2
all of the Share extensions available
on a user's device.


419
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,176 line:-2
Share Sheet support is powered
by the new Transferable protocol,


420
00:21:49.209 --> 00:21:52.913 line:-2 align:center
which introduces a type-safe API
for transferring app data.


421
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:58,652 line:-2
We've also made it easier to adopt SwiftUI
incrementally in your existing apps


422
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:03,557 line:-2
with a special collection view cell
that can host SwiftUI views.


423
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.660 line:-2 align:center
If you already have a collection view
in your UIKit app,


424
00:22:06.693 --> 00:22:10.764 line:-2 align:center
you can now write custom cells
using SwiftUI's declarative syntax.


425
00:22:10.797 --> 00:22:15.269 line:-2 align:center
These cells are tightly integrated
with UIKit, supporting swipe actions,


426
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:19,239 line:-2
cell backgrounds, and all the other
features of UICollectionView.


427
00:22:19.273 --> 00:22:22.109 line:-2 align:center
Today we're also introducing
a brand-new framework


428
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:23,677 line:-1
that complements SwiftUI


429
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,047 line:-2
and will allow you to express
even more of your interface.


430
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,049 line:-1
Here's Jo to tell you more.


431
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:31,218 line:0
Jo Arreaza-Taylor:
Today's world is filled with data.


432
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:33,453 line:0
Data to help understand, make decisions,


433
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:35,055 line:0
and see new perspectives.


434
00:22:35.088 --> 00:22:37.724 line:-2 align:center
A well-designed and accessible
data visualization


435
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:40,060 line:-1
can communicate complexities to your users


436
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:42,629 line:-1
in a way that feels clear and natural,


437
00:22:42.663 --> 00:22:44.798 line:-2 align:center
empowering them
as they move through the day.


438
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:48,702 line:-2
Like helping to show
changing trends in their health,


439
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,839 line:-2
highlighting their progress
towards personal goals,


440
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,807 line:-1
and preparing them for what's to come.


441
00:22:54.474 --> 00:22:58.312 line:-2 align:center
Today, we're introducing a new framework
to help empower your users


442
00:22:58,345 --> 00:23:00,581 line:-1
to unlock the data within your apps.


443
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:03,884 line:0
Say hello to Swift Charts.


444
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:07,354 line:-2
Swift Charts is a highly customizable
charting framework


445
00:23:07.387 --> 00:23:09.056 line:-1 align:center
built on top of SwiftUI


446
00:23:09.089 --> 00:23:12.793 line:-2 align:center
that makes it easy
to create gorgeous visualizations.


447
00:23:12.826 --> 00:23:16.830 line:-2 align:center
It uses the same declarative syntax
as SwiftUI to make it easy


448
00:23:16.864 --> 00:23:19.600 line:-2 align:center
to read and write code
which conveys visual information.


449
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,337 line:-2
Swift Chart lets you customize
the presentation of information


450
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.606 line:-1 align:center
to best fit the needs of your app


451
00:23:25.639 --> 00:23:28.175 line:-2 align:center
to create everything
from line and bar charts


452
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:32,446 line:-2
to more sophisticated examples
like heat maps and stream graphs,


453
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,314 line:-1
and many, many more types.


454
00:23:35.349 --> 00:23:38.285 line:-2 align:center
And because Swift Charts
is built on top of SwiftUI,


455
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:40,821 line:-2
charts have great support
for accessibility features,


456
00:23:40.854 --> 00:23:44.091 line:-2 align:center
like a terrific, out-of-the-box
VoiceOver experience


457
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:46,226 line:-1
that's easy to customize.


458
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,163 line:-2
Being built on SwiftUI also means
you can animate your charts,


459
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:53,534 line:-2
to help you give your app
just the right look and feel.


460
00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:57.871 line:-2 align:center
And of course, Swift Charts works great
across all our devices.


461
00:23:57,905 --> 00:23:59,973 line:-1
Eliza: Back in our Food Truck app,


462
00:24:00.007 --> 00:24:02.042 line:-1 align:center
here are the beautiful new Swift Charts


463
00:24:02.075 --> 00:24:05.479 line:-1 align:center
in Xcode's fully redesigned preview area.


464
00:24:05.512 --> 00:24:09.516 line:-2 align:center
I'm also using
the new multicolumn SwiftUI table view.


465
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.886 line:-2 align:center
Let me show you how easy it is
to build this chart.


466
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,256 line:-2
And as I scroll, check out
the awesome new structured headers


467
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.524 line:-1 align:center
in the source editor.


468
00:24:17.558 --> 00:24:20.394 line:-2 align:center
They make it really easy
to see where you are in the file.


469
00:24:21.428 --> 00:24:22.863 line:-1 align:center
Here's the code for the chart.


470
00:24:22.896 --> 00:24:26.767 line:-2 align:center
Now, this is actually a stacked bar chart,
but you can't really tell.


471
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,670 line:-2
Let's have each donut
use its own color.


472
00:24:31.038 --> 00:24:34.508 line:-2 align:center
Maybe it would be easier to see
how the donuts compare


473
00:24:34.541 --> 00:24:36.844 line:-1 align:center
if we position the bars side by side.


474
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:40,848 line:-2
I love how I can make
all these big changes


475
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:43.217 line:-1 align:center
with just a couple simple modifiers.


476
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.719 line:-1 align:center
We can customize the styling, too.


477
00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:48.689 line:-2 align:center
Let's make the bars
reflect the donut colors.


478
00:24:48,722 --> 00:24:52,292 line:-2
And we can even add annotations
to the bars with another modifier.


479
00:24:53.493 --> 00:24:54.962 line:-1 align:center
Looking great.


480
00:24:54.995 --> 00:24:56.897 line:-1 align:center
Previews are now live by default,


481
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,700 line:-2
so I can immediately interact
with my view.


482
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:01,435 line:-1
I'm gonna change the sort order.


483
00:25:01,468 --> 00:25:04,371 line:-1
Watch how the bars animate beautifully,


484
00:25:04.404 --> 00:25:07.241 line:-2 align:center
with Swift Charts
doing all the heavy lifting.


485
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:09,142 line:-1
Let's fetch more data.


486
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:11,612 line:-2
The chart and table
both automatically update


487
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:13,146 line:-1
as my model changes.


488
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,351 line:-2
The chart even recalculates its Y axis
to reflect the new totals.


489
00:25:17.384 --> 00:25:19.186 line:-1 align:center
Let me show you one more chart.


490
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:22,723 line:-2
I've stubbed out a line chart
which we can add to the view.


491
00:25:22,756 --> 00:25:25,192 line:-1
I'll jump to the implementation.


492
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:29,263 line:-2
Line charts with Swift Charts
have some really cool options.


493
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:32,032 line:-1
We can add symbols for each donut.


494
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:34,301 line:-1
We can annotate the lines.


495
00:25:34.334 --> 00:25:37.004 line:-2 align:center
We can even smooth the curves
with a variety


496
00:25:37.037 --> 00:25:38.839 line:-1 align:center
of interpolation strategies.


497
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:41,108 line:-1
Let's use catmullRom.


498
00:25:41.141 --> 00:25:43.610 line:-2 align:center
Finally, I'll override
the chart scale style


499
00:25:43.644 --> 00:25:45.746 line:-1 align:center
by providing my own mapping.


500
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:49,249 line:-2
That will make my chart fit in better
with the app's color scheme.


501
00:25:49.283 --> 00:25:50.751 line:-1 align:center
Really nice.


502
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:53,487 line:-2
The redesigned preview area
makes it easier than ever


503
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.223 line:-2 align:center
to see how my view looks
in different environments.


504
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:58,458 line:0
By pressing this button
in the canvas,


505
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:01,261 line:0
I can see my view in Dark and Light mode.


506
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:04,798 align:center
I can even look at my layout
in every interface orientation,


507
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:07,534 line:-2
all without adding
a single additional preview.


508
00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:10.037 line:-1 align:center
Let's zoom in on landscape.


509
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.207 line:-2 align:center
It looks like my UI
isn't quite fitting here.


510
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.608 line:-1 align:center
A few controls are offscreen,


511
00:26:14.641 --> 00:26:17.744 line:-2 align:center
and the charts have
an awkward aspect ratio.


512
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:21,048 line:-2
Let's see where we're describing
this layout.


513
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,384 line:-2
These views here are
in an implicit Vstack.


514
00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:29.089 line:-2 align:center
This year there are some powerful
new APIs in SwiftUI


515
00:26:29.122 --> 00:26:31.558 line:-1 align:center
that can create more flexible layouts.


516
00:26:31.592 --> 00:26:34.194 line:-1 align:center
Here, I'm going to use a ViewThatFits


517
00:26:34.228 --> 00:26:37.431 line:-2 align:center
to switch between a vertical
and a horizontal stack,


518
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,433 line:-1
depending on the available space.


519
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,469 line:-1
That looks much better.


520
00:26:42,503 --> 00:26:43,837 line:-1
Let's wire this up


521
00:26:43.871 --> 00:26:45.806 line:-2 align:center
so we can navigate to it
from the main screen.


522
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.977 line:-2 align:center
I'm using SwiftUI's
new navigation split view,


523
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,778 line:-1
which makes this really easy.


524
00:26:51.812 --> 00:26:55.249 line:-2 align:center
The split view has a sidebar
to track the selection


525
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,951 line:-2
and a NavigationStack
that changes its content


526
00:26:57.985 --> 00:27:00.687 line:-1 align:center
as the sidebar selection changes.


527
00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:02.089 line:-1 align:center
I'll jump into the sidebar


528
00:27:02.122 --> 00:27:05.158 line:-2 align:center
and add a navigation link
for our Donut Champion view.


529
00:27:05.192 --> 00:27:07.661 line:-2 align:center
And then, we can try it out
in the interactive preview.


530
00:27:08,428 --> 00:27:10,831 line:-2
I'd like to see my split view
in landscape,


531
00:27:10.864 --> 00:27:13.100 line:-1 align:center
so I'll use the new canvas settings


532
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,369 line:-1
to rotate the live preview.


533
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:17,004 line:-1
Works great.


534
00:27:17.037 --> 00:27:19.573 line:-2 align:center
I'm happy with how this is looking
on iPad,


535
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:21,842 line:-1
but now I'd love to bring it to Mac,


536
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:25,145 line:-2
and it's only a few clicks
to do that.


537
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:27,648 line:-2
I want to take full advantage
of the Mac SDK,


538
00:27:27.681 --> 00:27:29.116 line:-1 align:center
so I'm going to use native.


539
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:33,720 line:-1
With just a single target backing my app,


540
00:27:33.754 --> 00:27:35.756 line:-1 align:center
I can share almost all my code,


541
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:39.193 line:-2 align:center
and SwiftUI makes my app look great
on each platform.


542
00:27:39.226 --> 00:27:42.596 line:-2 align:center
I can also easily add
device-specific features.


543
00:27:42.629 --> 00:27:45.465 line:-2 align:center
For my Mac app,
let's add a menu bar extra.


544
00:27:45.499 --> 00:27:47.434 line:-1 align:center
Those are the little useful icons


545
00:27:47.467 --> 00:27:49.169 line:-1 align:center
on the upper right corner of your screen,


546
00:27:49.203 --> 00:27:52.239 line:-1 align:center
like Wi-Fi and Spotlight.


547
00:27:52.272 --> 00:27:55.309 line:-1 align:center
SwiftUI has a new API for this.


548
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,411 line:-1
I just add it to the body of my app.


549
00:27:57.444 --> 00:27:59.313 line:-1 align:center
Now let's run this for Mac.


550
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,720 line:-2
Our Donut Champion view looks great
on Mac right out of the box.


551
00:28:06.753 --> 00:28:08.755 line:-1 align:center
And here's that menu bar extra.


552
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:10,157 line:-1
That'll be handy.


553
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.459 line:-1 align:center
And that's a quick look at Swift Charts


554
00:28:12.492 --> 00:28:15.929 line:-2 align:center
and just a few of the enhancements
coming to SwiftUI and Xcode.


555
00:28:15.963 --> 00:28:17.798 line:-1 align:center
And now back to Josh.


556
00:28:17.831 --> 00:28:21.001 line:-2 align:center
Josh: We're continuing to expand
our adoption of SwiftUI


557
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:23,570 line:-1
across our apps and system interfaces.


558
00:28:23.604 --> 00:28:27.808 line:-2 align:center
For example, iOS's new Lock Screen widgets
were designed from the ground up


559
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:29.409 line:-1 align:center
using SwiftUI.


560
00:28:29.443 --> 00:28:32.346 line:-2 align:center
The new Font Book app was
completely rewritten with it.


561
00:28:32.379 --> 00:28:36.450 line:-2 align:center
And the modern, forward-looking design
of the new macOS System Settings app


562
00:28:36.483 --> 00:28:37.985 line:-1 align:center
was built using it.


563
00:28:38.018 --> 00:28:41.154 line:-2 align:center
Swift and SwiftUI were designed
from the start


564
00:28:41.188 --> 00:28:45.926 line:-2 align:center
to provide a single, native language
and API for all Apple platforms.


565
00:28:45.959 --> 00:28:48.795 line:-2 align:center
You can learn them once
and apply them everywhere.


566
00:28:48.829 --> 00:28:51.965 line:-2 align:center
Whether your vision is to provide
quick access to information


567
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,001 line:-1
at a glance on Apple Watch,


568
00:28:54,034 --> 00:28:57,271 line:-2
productivity tools
on MacBook Pro and iPad,


569
00:28:57.304 --> 00:28:59.173 line:-1 align:center
new experiences on iPhone,


570
00:28:59.206 --> 00:29:01.575 line:-1 align:center
or a new way to relax with Apple TV,


571
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:04,077 line:-1
Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode


572
00:29:04.111 --> 00:29:07.781 line:-2 align:center
provide a next-generation integrated
development platform


573
00:29:07.814 --> 00:29:11.051 line:-2 align:center
to help you build apps
for all of our products.


574
00:29:11.084 --> 00:29:12.686 line:-1 align:center
Now, if you have an existing app,


575
00:29:12.719 --> 00:29:16.156 line:-2 align:center
it's easy to adopt
these new technologies incrementally.


576
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,693 line:-2
And if you're new to our platforms
or if you're starting a brand-new app,


577
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:23,830 line:-2
the best way to build an app
is with Swift and SwiftUI.


578
00:29:23.864 --> 00:29:26.066 line:-2 align:center
Now, of course
that's just the beginning.


579
00:29:26.099 --> 00:29:30.037 line:-2 align:center
We're also continuing to evolve
the user experience of our platforms


580
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.873 line:-2 align:center
to give you more ways
to engage your users.


581
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:35,242 line:-1
And to tell you more, here's Sebastien.


582
00:29:36.543 --> 00:29:38.579 line:-2 align:center
Sebastien Marineau-Mes:
Now, apps are about turning ideas,


583
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:41,315 line:-1
code, and APIs into user experiences.


584
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:43,650 align:center
And the best apps
are the ones that can meet users


585
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,919 line:0
where they are in the moment.


586
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,623 align:center
We've created ways to help you take
user experience beyond your apps,


587
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:53,293 line:-2
and build it into the system experience
on Apple devices.


588
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:57,831 line:-2
This journey started with extensions,
integration with the Share Sheet,


589
00:29:57.865 --> 00:29:59.566 line:-1 align:center
and custom keyboards.


590
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.902 line:-2 align:center
And more recently,
it's included the ability


591
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:06,206 line:-2
to have your app display key information
on the Home Screen using widgets.


592
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.041 line:-2 align:center
Now, this year,
there are a number of new ways


593
00:30:08.075 --> 00:30:11.144 line:-2 align:center
for your app to integrate with the system
experience across our platforms,


594
00:30:11.178 --> 00:30:15.649 line:-2 align:center
and it really starts with the Lock Screen,
which gets its biggest update ever.


595
00:30:15.682 --> 00:30:19.186 line:-2 align:center
It re-imagines how
the Lock Screen looks and how it works,


596
00:30:19.219 --> 00:30:23.557 line:-2 align:center
and it gives your ideas and your apps
another place to engage users.


597
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,959 line:-1
And to tell you more, here's Robert.


598
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:35,969 line:-2
Robert Dhaene:
In reimagining the Lock Screen,


599
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:38,972 line:-2
we set out to make it
even more personal and beautiful,


600
00:30:39.006 --> 00:30:40.841 line:-1 align:center
while improving everyday utility.


601
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:43,610 align:center
As part of this,
we knew we needed to bring


602
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:46,580 line:0
the power of widgets
to the all-new Lock Screen.


603
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:49,650 line:-2
Widgets have been an incredible way
to elevate key information


604
00:30:49.683 --> 00:30:53.654 line:-2 align:center
from your app and display it
where people can view it at a glance.


605
00:30:53.687 --> 00:30:57.324 line:-2 align:center
They make it easy to access
rich, timely information


606
00:30:57.357 --> 00:30:58.725 line:-1 align:center
right from the Home Screen.


607
00:30:59.393 --> 00:31:02.963 line:-2 align:center
The Lock Screen is the first thing you see
every time you pick up your iPhone,


608
00:31:02,996 --> 00:31:05,599 line:-2
and it's always been a place
to check the date and time


609
00:31:05.632 --> 00:31:07.501 line:-1 align:center
and look out for key messages.


610
00:31:07.534 --> 00:31:11.205 line:-2 align:center
When thinking about the best format
for displaying even more information here,


611
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:13,740 line:-2
we didn't have to look far
for design inspiration.


612
00:31:14.374 --> 00:31:18.245 line:-2 align:center
Complications on Apple Watch
already provide glanceable, relevant,


613
00:31:18.278 --> 00:31:19.713 line:-1 align:center
and up-to-date information,


614
00:31:19.746 --> 00:31:22.516 line:-2 align:center
presented beautifully
right when users need it.


615
00:31:23.183 --> 00:31:26.887 line:-2 align:center
The design language naturally extends
to iOS and feels right at home


616
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.789 line:-1 align:center
on the new Lock Screen.


617
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:31,992 line:-2
So using WidgetKit,
we brought some of those same designs


618
00:31:32.025 --> 00:31:35.128 line:-2 align:center
to widgets on the Lock Screen,
including Circular,


619
00:31:35.162 --> 00:31:39.833 line:-2 align:center
which displays a small image,
gauge, or a few characters of text.


620
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:43,537 line:-2
Circular widgets are great for displaying
whether you've been active enough today


621
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,672 line:-1
or if you need to go out for a run.


622
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:48,342 line:-1
Rectangular provides a large canvas


623
00:31:48.375 --> 00:31:51.745 line:-2 align:center
for displaying things
like the upcoming weather forecast.


624
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:54,681 line:-2
Inline provides a powerful way
to convey information


625
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:59,086 line:-2
with a tiny amount of text and SF Symbols
above the clock on iPhone,


626
00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:03.156 line:-2 align:center
next to a system-supplied date string,
such as Monday the 6th.


627
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:08.495 line:-2 align:center
And by the way, all of these widgets
work on both iOS and watchOS


628
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:10,497 line:-1
because starting in watchOS 9,


629
00:32:10.531 --> 00:32:13.734 line:-2 align:center
complications
are also powered by WidgetKit.


630
00:32:13.767 --> 00:32:16.336 line:-2 align:center
For the first time,
you can use the same code


631
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.274 line:-2 align:center
to generate glanceable data
on both platforms.


632
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:23,343 line:-2
WidgetKit manages platform differences
for you automatically,


633
00:32:23.377 --> 00:32:25.646 line:-2 align:center
using the appropriate system fonts
by default,


634
00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:29.449 line:-2 align:center
and tinting the widgets on
the Lock Screen for maximum legibility.


635
00:32:29.483 --> 00:32:32.953 line:-2 align:center
To show you how to use WidgetKit to create
widgets for the Lock Screen on iPhone


636
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:35,756 line:-2
and complications on Apple Watch
using the same code,


637
00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:37.691 line:-1 align:center
I'll hand it over to Michael.


638
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,662 align:center
Michael Kent: Building widgets
on the iPhone Lock Screen


639
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:44,965 line:0
and complications on Apple Watch
is really easy with WidgetKit.


640
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:47,568 line:-2
If you've made Home Screen widgets,
you're already most of the way there,


641
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:50.037 line:-2 align:center
including how your data
and timeline are updated.


642
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,573 line:-2
In our Food Truck app,
we already have a systemSmall widget


643
00:32:52.606 --> 00:32:54.274 line:-1 align:center
that users can add to their Home Screen


644
00:32:54.308 --> 00:32:57.144 line:-2 align:center
to see how many orders they've filled
out of their quota today.


645
00:32:57.177 --> 00:32:59.680 line:-2 align:center
This kind of information would be great
to show on the Lock Screen


646
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:01,915 line:-1
or in a complication on the watch face.


647
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:04,151 line:-2
Let's start by building out
the Circular family.


648
00:33:05.652 --> 00:33:08.422 line:-2 align:center
We'll first declare support for it
in our Supported Families array.


649
00:33:09.556 --> 00:33:12.192 line:-2 align:center
You'll notice that we're using
some platform conditionals here.


650
00:33:12.226 --> 00:33:15.929 line:-2 align:center
This is because we want this widget
to continue supporting macOS and iOS


651
00:33:15.963 --> 00:33:19.533 line:-2 align:center
with systemSmall, but that family
isn't available on watchOS.


652
00:33:20.367 --> 00:33:22.503 line:-1 align:center
Then, we'll add a case to define its view.


653
00:33:24.171 --> 00:33:26.540 line:-2 align:center
Let's use a gauge
that shows the current number of orders


654
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,208 line:-1
from 0 to the daily quota


655
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:31,011 line:-2
so the users can quickly see
their progress at a glance.


656
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:34,815 line:-2
We'll display the current order count
as text in the center,


657
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:37,384 line:-2
along with a donut symbol.
There.


658
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,319 line:-2
Let's take a look at this
in Xcode Previews now.


659
00:33:40.888 --> 00:33:42.256 line:-2 align:center
Awesome!
That feels right at home


660
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,123 line:-1
on the Lock Screen.


661
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,993 line:-2
In order to show a bit more detail
at a glance,


662
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:48,495 line:-2
we can also add support
for the rectangular family.


663
00:33:52.099 --> 00:33:54.902 line:-2 align:center
For this view,
we'll make a VStack,


664
00:33:54.935 --> 00:33:57.271 line:-2 align:center
starting with a title for the data
that's shown,


665
00:33:57.304 --> 00:33:58.972 line:-1 align:center
and that same donut symbol.


666
00:33:59,673 --> 00:34:01,942 line:-1
By using the Headline style for the font,


667
00:34:01.975 --> 00:34:04.444 line:-2 align:center
we'll get a treatment
that looks great on both platforms.


668
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:07,581 line:-2
And we'll make sure it pops
with the widgetAccentable modifier.


669
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:10,951 line:-2
Since the rectangular family gives us
a bit more space,


670
00:34:10,984 --> 00:34:13,720 line:-1
we'll show a cool custom segmented gauge


671
00:34:13.754 --> 00:34:16.557 line:-2 align:center
and display the current number of orders
out of the daily quota


672
00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.258 line:-1 align:center
for the gauge's label.


673
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:20,327 line:-1
Looking back at the canvas,


674
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:29,102 line:-2
Now let's take a look at how this widget
would appear as a circular complication


675
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:30,604 line:-1
on a watch face.


676
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,508 line:-1
Well, all right, everything is there,


677
00:34:34.541 --> 00:34:37.010 line:-2 align:center
but for complications,
we also need to consider


678
00:34:37,044 --> 00:34:38,312 line:-1
the full color rendering mode,


679
00:34:38.345 --> 00:34:41.415 line:-1 align:center
which is the default in Xcode Previews.


680
00:34:41.448 --> 00:34:45.586 line:-2 align:center
Let's do that by adding a tint
to each of our gauges.


681
00:34:46.854 --> 00:34:49.923 line:-2 align:center
And a foreground color
to the rectangular headline.


682
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,260 line:-1
For a bit of a pop in full color,


683
00:34:53.293 --> 00:34:56.864 line:-2 align:center
we can check the rendering mode
with an environment property


684
00:34:56.897 --> 00:35:00.300 line:-2 align:center
to replace the donut symbol
with a donut emoji


685
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:01,969 line:-1
on both the circular


686
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:03,770 line:-1
and rectangular views.


687
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:06,306 line:-1
That looks really great!


688
00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.208 line:-1 align:center
With the new variants UI in previews,


689
00:35:08.242 --> 00:35:11.245 line:-2 align:center
we can change the color
we're previewing with no code at all.


690
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:14,348 line:-1
Or even look at several at once.


691
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:18,185 line:-2
And since we used default spacing,
system font styles,


692
00:35:18.218 --> 00:35:19.786 line:-1 align:center
and adapted to the rendering mode,


693
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.290 line:-2 align:center
the same views look right at home
on both the Lock Screen and watch face.


694
00:35:23.323 --> 00:35:26.960 line:-2 align:center
It's that easy to make a widget
on the brand-new Lock Screen in iOS 16


695
00:35:26.994 --> 00:35:30.731 line:-2 align:center
and a great complication in watchOS 9,
all with the same code.


696
00:35:30,764 --> 00:35:33,967 line:-2
But this isn't the only way we've brought
the power of WidgetKit to the Lock Screen.


697
00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:35.602 line:-1 align:center
Here's Matt to tell you more.


698
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,237 align:center
Matt Shepherd: With WidgetKit,


699
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:39,973 align:center
you can give people access
to glanceable information.


700
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:42,476 align:center
But what about those moments
when they need live updates,


701
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:44,178 align:center
information tied to an activity,


702
00:35:44.211 --> 00:35:46.613 line:-2 align:center
or an event
that they care about right now?


703
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:51,285 line:-2
For that, we are working on something new
we call Live Activities.


704
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:53,487 line:-2
Live Activities makes it easier
to stay on top of things


705
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.289 line:-1 align:center
that are happening in real time,


706
00:35:55.322 --> 00:35:56.890 line:-1 align:center
right from the Lock Screen.


707
00:35:56.924 --> 00:36:00.194 line:-1 align:center
Things like the latest score from a game,


708
00:36:00.227 --> 00:36:03.664 line:-2 align:center
the progress of a ride share,
or a workout,


709
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:06,233 line:-2
right on the Lock Screen,
and always up-to-date.


710
00:36:06.266 --> 00:36:09.870 line:-2 align:center
Just like with widgets,
you create Live Activities with WidgetKit.


711
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:12,573 line:-2
The difference is, you update
your Live Activity's presentation


712
00:36:12.606 --> 00:36:14.374 line:-1 align:center
and state in real time.


713
00:36:14.408 --> 00:36:17.611 line:-2 align:center
Since they're built with SwiftUI,
you can even animate your updates


714
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:19,746 line:-1
from one state to the next.


715
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,782 line:-2
These updates make sure
your Live Activities


716
00:36:21,815 --> 00:36:25,619 line:-2
has the most current information
when the user chooses to glance at it.


717
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:30,657 line:-2
Live Activities will be available starting
in an update to iOS 16 later this year.


718
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,160 line:-2
So those are the updates
to the all-new Lock Screen.


719
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,262 line:-2
We think they're gonna be a great way
to help you give people


720
00:36:35.295 --> 00:36:38.565 line:-2 align:center
more information at a glance
in the moments they need it most.


721
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:42,769 line:-2
Next, let's talk about a brand-new way
to enhance collaborative experiences.


722
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:45,105 line:-1
To tell you more, here's Pierre.


723
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:47,140 line:0
Pierre de Fillipis:
Collaboration is an important part


724
00:36:47,174 --> 00:36:50,677 line:0
of what people do
on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.


725
00:36:50.711 --> 00:36:53.547 line:-2 align:center
And that's due in large part
to the incredible wealth of apps


726
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.182 line:-1 align:center
that many of you have built,


727
00:36:55.215 --> 00:36:58.051 line:-2 align:center
to support teams who are collaborating
across any distance.


728
00:36:58.085 --> 00:37:01.755 line:-2 align:center
There's collaboration for work,
like a product road map in Airtable,


729
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:06,393 line:-2
and there's also collaboration for play,
like finding your dream home in Redfin.


730
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:08,262 line:-1
Whether it's for work or play,


731
00:37:08.295 --> 00:37:11.431 line:-2 align:center
collaboration often starts
with a conversation.


732
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:13,967 align:center
And with the new
Messages Collaboration API,


733
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:17,137 align:center
you can bring your app's
existing collaboration experiences


734
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:18,939 line:0
into Messages and FaceTime.


735
00:37:18.972 --> 00:37:21.875 line:-2 align:center
When users share a link
to content in your app,


736
00:37:21.909 --> 00:37:25.579 line:-2 align:center
the API makes it easy for you
to mark that link as collaborative,


737
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:27,681 line:-1
enabling a seamless experience.


738
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:29,816 line:-1
We provide the identifiers you need


739
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.319 line:-2 align:center
so you can give access
to the recipients immediately


740
00:37:32.352 --> 00:37:34.154 line:-1 align:center
when they tap the link to join.


741
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:37,090 line:-2
And of course,
this works without compromising privacy.


742
00:37:37.124 --> 00:37:41.161 line:-2 align:center
Messages identities and app identities
remain private and are not shared.


743
00:37:41.195 --> 00:37:44.998 line:-2 align:center
And the best part is, you can do this
with existing technologies


744
00:37:45.032 --> 00:37:47.467 line:-1 align:center
your app is most likely already using.


745
00:37:47.501 --> 00:37:51.638 line:-2 align:center
With one object,
your users can initiate collaboration


746
00:37:51.672 --> 00:37:54.741 line:-2 align:center
in two convenient ways
that they're already familiar with.


747
00:37:54.775 --> 00:37:57.444 line:-2 align:center
One, the Share Sheet,
which has been updated


748
00:37:57.477 --> 00:37:59.613 line:-1 align:center
to put collaboration front and center,


749
00:37:59.646 --> 00:38:01.181 line:-1 align:center
and two, drag & drop,


750
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:03,917 line:-2
where you can share content
you want to collaborate on


751
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:07,120 line:-2
by dragging it directly
into the Messages conversation.


752
00:38:07.154 --> 00:38:10.724 line:-2 align:center
And once the conversation is started,
you can even post notices


753
00:38:10.757 --> 00:38:14.228 line:-2 align:center
about content updates
right to the Messages conversation.


754
00:38:14.261 --> 00:38:17.965 line:-2 align:center
With a couple lines of code,
your users can get back to collaborating


755
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:21,201 line:-1
in your app with a single tap in Messages.


756
00:38:21,235 --> 00:38:22,870 line:-1
And with the collaboration popover,


757
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:26,740 line:-2
your users can get back to the
conversation in Messages or FaceTime


758
00:38:26.773 --> 00:38:28.075 line:-1 align:center
right from your app.


759
00:38:28.108 --> 00:38:30.110 line:-1 align:center
So with the Messages Collaboration API,


760
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:33,947 line:-2
your app is truly woven into the fabric
of Messages and FaceTime.


761
00:38:33.981 --> 00:38:37.851 line:-2 align:center
We take care of giving your users
powerful communication tools


762
00:38:37.885 --> 00:38:40.921 line:-2 align:center
so you can focus
on the powerful collaboration tools


763
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:42,589 line:-1
you deliver in your app.


764
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:47,027 line:-2
So this is going to level up collaboration
on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS,


765
00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.197 line:-2 align:center
creating a consistent experience
that's deeply rooted


766
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,566 line:-2
in the connection
between the people collaborating,


767
00:38:52.599 --> 00:38:54.101 line:-1 align:center
whether for work or play.


768
00:38:54.134 --> 00:38:56.637 line:-1 align:center
Next is Ari, who's going to tell you


769
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.239 line:-1 align:center
about a new framework called App Intents.


770
00:38:59,273 --> 00:39:02,776 line:0
Ari Weinstein: I'm excited to tell you
about the App Intents framework,


771
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:05,412 align:center
which makes your app's features
available to the system,


772
00:39:05,445 --> 00:39:09,349 line:-2
so people can use them automatically
through Siri and Shortcuts.


773
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:11,718 line:-2
People love using Shortcuts
with their apps.


774
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:15,189 line:-2
They let them get things done so fast,
just by asking Siri,


775
00:39:15.222 --> 00:39:18.492 line:-2 align:center
or by quickly tapping a shortcut
on the Home Screen.


776
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:21,595 line:-2
And it's amazing
to see how people remix app capabilities


777
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:23,697 line:-1
into totally new pieces of functionality


778
00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.465 line:-1 align:center
with custom shortcuts.


779
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:29,870 line:-2
Today, people have to add shortcuts
manually before they can use them at all.


780
00:39:29.903 --> 00:39:34.208 line:-2 align:center
We're making this automatic in iOS 16
with the new App Intents framework.


781
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:39,279 align:center
App Intents works together with Shortcuts
to form App Shortcuts,


782
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:41,448 align:center
which people can use with Siri
right away,


783
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:43,283 align:center
without having to set anything up first,


784
00:39:43.317 --> 00:39:46.553 line:-2 align:center
like, "Hey, Siri, clean the kitchen
with Roomba."


785
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:48,155 line:-1
But it's not just Siri.


786
00:39:48,188 --> 00:39:50,724 line:-2
App shortcuts give your users
a front-row seat


787
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:52,860 line:-2
to your app's features
throughout the system,


788
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:56,496 line:-2
like in Spotlight, where anytime
people search for your app,


789
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,699 line:-1
your shortcuts show up, too,


790
00:39:58.732 --> 00:40:02.469 line:-2 align:center
and your shortcuts will be suggested
right below app suggestions


791
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:06,473 line:-2
without needing to adopt
any additional APIs, like donations.


792
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:09,576 line:-2
Your shortcuts also appear immediately
in the Shortcuts app,


793
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,678 line:-1
where people can run them with a tap.


794
00:40:12,346 --> 00:40:15,516 align:center
App Intents is the next step
for the SiriKit Intents framework


795
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:17,751 line:0
that we introduced in iOS10.


796
00:40:17.784 --> 00:40:21.188 line:-2 align:center
If you adopt Intents to integrate
with Widgets or domains


797
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:22,556 line:-1
like media or messaging,


798
00:40:22.589 --> 00:40:25.792 line:-2 align:center
you should keep using
the SiriKit Intents framework,


799
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:29,229 line:-2
but for developers who build
custom intents for Siri and Shortcuts,


800
00:40:29.263 --> 00:40:31.465 line:-2 align:center
you should go ahead and upgrade
to App Intents.


801
00:40:31.498 --> 00:40:34.668 line:-2 align:center
You can easily upgrade to App Intents
in Xcode


802
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:37,971 line:-2
by pushing the Convert button
in your intent definition file.


803
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:41,008 line:-2
Xcode will generate the equivalent
App Intents source code,


804
00:40:41.041 --> 00:40:43.477 line:-2 align:center
and then you fill in the blanks
with your intent handling code.


805
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.747 line:-2 align:center
The App Intents framework is really easy
to develop for


806
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,883 line:-2
because it's designed
from the ground up for Swift,


807
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:52,252 line:-1
and it requires much less code.


808
00:40:52.286 --> 00:40:55.622 line:-2 align:center
The Swift code that you write
is the only source of truth,


809
00:40:55.656 --> 00:40:57.925 line:-2 align:center
There's no separate
intent definition files


810
00:40:57.958 --> 00:41:00.227 line:-1 align:center
or code generation to keep in sync.


811
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,863 line:-2
And the code is easy to add
to your project.


812
00:41:02.896 --> 00:41:05.399 line:-2 align:center
You don't need to rearchitect
your codebase.


813
00:41:05.432 --> 00:41:08.502 line:-2 align:center
Even if you have Objective-C code,
you can use it with App Intents


814
00:41:08.535 --> 00:41:10.137 line:-1 align:center
by wrapping it with Swift.


815
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,540 line:-2
An app intent represents something
people can do inside of your app,


816
00:41:13.574 --> 00:41:16.777 line:-2 align:center
and it makes it possible to do it
from outside of your app.


817
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.513 line:-2 align:center
You can define an intent
and add an app shortcut


818
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:21,215 line:-1
in just a few lines of code.


819
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:23,417 line:-1
Let's give it a try together.


820
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.119 line:-2 align:center
Back in the Food Truck app,
I have this great chart view


821
00:41:26.153 --> 00:41:28.722 line:-2 align:center
that lets me see the top five
best-selling donuts


822
00:41:28.755 --> 00:41:32.626 line:-2 align:center
over a given period of time,
like today or this week.


823
00:41:32.659 --> 00:41:34.795 line:-2 align:center
I want to expose this
to Siri and Shortcuts


824
00:41:34.828 --> 00:41:37.564 line:-1 align:center
so people pull it up super quickly,


825
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:41,001 line:-2
so first, in Xcode,
I'll go to a new Swift file.


826
00:41:41.034 --> 00:41:44.338 line:-2 align:center
I'll import the App Intents framework
and SwiftUI.


827
00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:48.375 line:-2 align:center
Then I define the intent
by defining a struct


828
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:51,044 line:-1
that conforms to the AppIntent protocol.


829
00:41:51.078 --> 00:41:53.413 line:-1 align:center
I'll give it a title.


830
00:41:53.447 --> 00:41:57.417 line:-2 align:center
And I'll add a parameter
for which time frame of trends to look at.


831
00:41:57.451 --> 00:42:01.388 line:-2 align:center
This uses the time frame enum
that's already defined in my codebase.


832
00:42:01.421 --> 00:42:05.092 line:-2 align:center
I need to extend it to conform
to the AppEnum protocol


833
00:42:05.125 --> 00:42:07.394 line:-2 align:center
so that we can extract
human-readable names


834
00:42:07.427 --> 00:42:08.829 line:-1 align:center
for each enum case,


835
00:42:08.862 --> 00:42:11.231 line:-1 align:center
like "today" and "this week."


836
00:42:11.265 --> 00:42:15.736 line:-2 align:center
Next, on the intent,
I'll implement the perform method.


837
00:42:15.769 --> 00:42:19.806 line:-2 align:center
Here, I return a result that includes
the SwiftUI chart view.


838
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,809 line:-2
I could also include a dialogue
or output value.


839
00:42:22.843 --> 00:42:26.547 line:-2 align:center
I want people to be able to use
this intent automatically, without setup,


840
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,282 line:-1
so I'll define an app shortcut.


841
00:42:30.184 --> 00:42:32.886 line:-2 align:center
This includes the phrase
that people can say to Siri


842
00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.655 line:-1 align:center
to use this intent.


843
00:42:34.688 --> 00:42:38.425 line:-2 align:center
The phrase has to include the app name
as a variable,


844
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:41,061 line:-1
and I've included the time frame parameter


845
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:44,131 line:-2
so people can say
"Food truck trends for today,"


846
00:42:44.164 --> 00:42:47.134 line:-1 align:center
or "Food truck trends for this week."


847
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,637 line:-2
The last thing I need to do is make this
discoverable for my users.


848
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:52,840 line:-2
People need to see the phrase
at some point,


849
00:42:52.873 --> 00:42:54.641 line:-1 align:center
so they know what to say to Siri,


850
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:57,945 line:-2
so I'm going to switch to the file
for the Top 5 Donuts view


851
00:42:57.978 --> 00:42:59.713 line:-1 align:center
that we were looking at a second ago,


852
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:01,815 line:-1
and I'll add a Siri tip.


853
00:43:03.383 --> 00:43:07.554 line:-2 align:center
Now I can build and run the app
and hop over to my phone.


854
00:43:07.588 --> 00:43:08.622 line:-1 align:center
Let's give it a try.


855
00:43:11.124 --> 00:43:13.760 line:-2 align:center
I can see the shortcut now appears
in the Shortcuts app,


856
00:43:13,794 --> 00:43:16,029 line:-1
with variants for each parameter value,


857
00:43:16.063 --> 00:43:19.600 line:-2 align:center
and I can run one
just by tapping on it.


858
00:43:19.633 --> 00:43:22.936 line:-2 align:center
And I can run them from Siri
just by saying the phrase,


859
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:25.005 line:-1 align:center
"Food truck trends for today."


860
00:43:26.807 --> 00:43:30.177 line:-2 align:center
Or I could say,
"food truck trends for this week."


861
00:43:32.446 --> 00:43:34.848 line:-2 align:center
When people are in
the Top Five view of my app,


862
00:43:34.882 --> 00:43:36.950 line:-2 align:center
they'll see this tip we added
at the bottom,


863
00:43:36.984 --> 00:43:40.487 line:-2 align:center
so they know what to say to Siri
to ask for this feature.


864
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:43,824 line:-2
Lastly, people can quickly access these
in Spotlight


865
00:43:43.857 --> 00:43:45.926 line:-1 align:center
when they search for the app, like this.


866
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:50,297 line:-1
It's super useful.


867
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.268 line:-2 align:center
App Intents will make it easier than ever
before to make your app's functionality


868
00:43:54.301 --> 00:43:58.939 line:-2 align:center
available throughout the system experience
on all of these platforms.


869
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:01,441 line:-2
Next, Ricky will tell us
about some big updates


870
00:44:01.475 --> 00:44:03.377 line:-1 align:center
to authentication technologies.


871
00:44:04,044 --> 00:44:05,612 line:0
Ricky Mondello:
For as long as we can remember,


872
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:08,215 line:0
we've been creating and using passwords.


873
00:44:08.248 --> 00:44:10.417 line:-1 align:center
But passwords have serious issues,


874
00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:14.588 line:-2 align:center
like phishing, reuse across accounts,
and website leaks.


875
00:44:14.621 --> 00:44:18.258 line:-2 align:center
The good news is that together
we can solve these issues.


876
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:21,328 line:0
And we can do this today with Passkeys.


877
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:24,298 align:center
Passkeys will streamline
your authentication flows


878
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:27,601 align:center
and address the top security issues
with passwords.


879
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:30,904 line:-2
Passkeys were designed
to be incredibly easy to use.


880
00:44:30,938 --> 00:44:34,441 line:-2
The interface uses familiar
Autofill-style UI


881
00:44:34.474 --> 00:44:37.945 line:-2 align:center
and FaceID and TouchID
for biometric verification.


882
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:41,615 line:-2
These elements create a seamless
transition away from passwords,


883
00:44:41.648 --> 00:44:45.152 line:-2 align:center
while delivering
a profound increase in security.


884
00:44:45.185 --> 00:44:47.354 line:-1 align:center
Let's check out Passkeys in action.


885
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:50,257 line:-1
When setting up an account with a passkey,


886
00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:52.526 line:-1 align:center
I don't need to create a password.


887
00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:57.664 line:-2 align:center
I'll type a user name and save
the passkey to my iCloud Keychain.


888
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:02,135 line:-2
This will securely sync this passkey
to all of my other Apple devices.


889
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:06,273 line:-2
And if I sign out,
signing back in is a breeze.


890
00:45:06,306 --> 00:45:09,476 line:0
Just Face ID, and I'm in.


891
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,713 line:-2
Because passkeys are built
on open industry standards


892
00:45:12.746 --> 00:45:14.448 line:-1 align:center
that platforms are adopting,


893
00:45:14.481 --> 00:45:17.751 line:-2 align:center
I can use the passkey
I just created on my iPhone


894
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:21,255 line:-2
to sign into the Food Truck website
on my friend's PC.


895
00:45:21.288 --> 00:45:25.359 line:-2 align:center
On the website,
I'll type my username, submit,


896
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:29,062 line:-2
and choose the option to sign in
using a phone,


897
00:45:29.096 --> 00:45:31.498 line:-1 align:center
scan the QR code,


898
00:45:31,532 --> 00:45:36,737 line:-1
let the iPhone and PC securely connect,


899
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,306 line:-1
and I'm signed in.


900
00:45:39.339 --> 00:45:42.709 line:-2 align:center
In Safari on my Mac,
it's even easier to sign in.


901
00:45:42.743 --> 00:45:45.779 line:-2 align:center
My passkey is already here,
thanks to iCloud Keychain,


902
00:45:45.812 --> 00:45:49.449 line:-2 align:center
and I can sign in directly
from the website's username field.


903
00:45:49.483 --> 00:45:53.287 line:-2 align:center
It's easy to integrate passkeys
into existing sign-in flows.


904
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,591 line:-2
For example, this website's username field
lets me sign in with a passkey


905
00:45:57.624 --> 00:45:59.259 line:-1 align:center
or a password.


906
00:45:59.293 --> 00:46:04.031 line:-2 align:center
If I type a username
for a password based account,


907
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:05,599 line:-1
I can quickly sign in.


908
00:46:05.632 --> 00:46:08.402 line:-2 align:center
With passkeys,
the device does the hard work,


909
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,771 line:-1
and it's secure every time.


910
00:46:10.804 --> 00:46:12.306 line:-1 align:center
When creating a passkey,


911
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:16,143 line:-2
the device generates a unique key
that is specific to the website or app


912
00:46:16.176 --> 00:46:19.880 line:-2 align:center
it was created for
and protects it behind biometrics.


913
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:22,449 line:-1
It's impossible to have a weak passkey.


914
00:46:22.482 --> 00:46:25.385 line:-1 align:center
It can't be forgotten, reused, or guessed.


915
00:46:25.419 --> 00:46:28.555 line:-2 align:center
Passkeys are based
on public key cryptography,


916
00:46:28.589 --> 00:46:32.259 line:-2 align:center
which makes credential leaks
from servers a thing of the past.


917
00:46:32.292 --> 00:46:35.596 line:-2 align:center
Instead of storing salted,
hashed passwords,


918
00:46:35.629 --> 00:46:40.734 line:-2 align:center
that can leak and be cracked,
your server keeps only a public key.


919
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:43,270 line:-2
Public keys are designed
to be truly public,


920
00:46:43.303 --> 00:46:45.572 line:-1 align:center
and not at all valuable to hackers.


921
00:46:45.606 --> 00:46:49.376 line:-2 align:center
This significantly reduces your risk
as a website owner.


922
00:46:49.409 --> 00:46:52.346 line:-2 align:center
With passkeys–
and this point is huge–


923
00:46:52,379 --> 00:46:55,382 line:-2
credential phishing as we know it today
is gone,


924
00:46:55.415 --> 00:46:59.620 line:-2 align:center
eliminating the number one
security vulnerability that users face.


925
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:03,690 line:-2
Passkeys are intrinsically linked to the
website or app they were set up for,


926
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:07,995 line:-2
so users can never be tricked into
using their passkey on the wrong website.


927
00:47:08.028 --> 00:47:09.696 line:-1 align:center
And unlike passwords,


928
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,533 line:-2
it's not possible to type
or copy a passkey


929
00:47:12.566 --> 00:47:14.668 line:-1 align:center
into a convincing fake website,


930
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:18.405 line:-2 align:center
or even give anything away to
someone looking over your shoulder.


931
00:47:18,438 --> 00:47:21,308 line:-2
When you put it all together,
what we're talking about here


932
00:47:21.341 --> 00:47:23.810 line:-1 align:center
is a new era of account security.


933
00:47:23.844 --> 00:47:27.915 line:-2 align:center
Bringing passkeys to your app
and website takes only a few steps.


934
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:31,251 line:-2
First, you'll teach your account backend
to store public keys


935
00:47:31.285 --> 00:47:33.854 line:-1 align:center
and issue authentication challenges.


936
00:47:33.887 --> 00:47:36.356 line:-1 align:center
Then, on your website and in your app,


937
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,225 line:-1
you'll offer passkeys to users


938
00:47:38.258 --> 00:47:42.496 line:-2 align:center
and adopt API to create
a new passkey and sign in with it.


939
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:47,100 line:-2
Passkeys are based on the Web
Authentication, or WebAuthn, standard,


940
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:50,037 line:-2
which has been a collaborative effort
across the industry


941
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:53.574 line:-2 align:center
from both platform vendors
and service owners.


942
00:47:53.607 --> 00:47:56.777 line:-2 align:center
The standard itself is mature
and well documented,


943
00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:59.279 line:-1 align:center
and passkeys fit it like a glove.


944
00:47:59.313 --> 00:48:02.850 line:-2 align:center
All of this is ready
for you to build on right now.


945
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:06,620 line:-2
Next generation security,
a seamless user experience,


946
00:48:06.653 --> 00:48:10.991 line:-2 align:center
and a design that works beautifully
alongside passwords during the transition.


947
00:48:11.024 --> 00:48:12.626 line:-1 align:center
Back to you, Sebastien.


948
00:48:12.659 --> 00:48:15.362 line:-2 align:center
Sebastien: You've just seen
a few of the newest ways


949
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:19,900 line:-2
that you can integrate your apps with the
system experience on all of our platforms.


950
00:48:19.933 --> 00:48:23.637 line:-2 align:center
And beyond those integration points,
there are a ton of new APIs


951
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.839 line:-2 align:center
and frameworks
across all of our platforms


952
00:48:25.873 --> 00:48:29.643 line:-2 align:center
that open up even more possibilities
for you and your apps this year.


953
00:48:30.477 --> 00:48:32.479 line:-1 align:center
And I'd like to walk you through a few


954
00:48:32,513 --> 00:48:35,949 line:-2
before diving into some others
in more detail.


955
00:48:35,983 --> 00:48:38,585 line:-1
Let's start with iPadOS.


956
00:48:38.619 --> 00:48:43.090 line:-2 align:center
With iPadOS 16, you'll be able to make
the most powerful iPad apps yet,


957
00:48:43.123 --> 00:48:46.493 line:-2 align:center
with a consistent,
desktop-like experience.


958
00:48:46,527 --> 00:48:50,097 line:-2
There's a seamless find-and-replace
experience for UI text views


959
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,299 line:-1
that your apps get automatically,


960
00:48:52.332 --> 00:48:54.601 line:-1 align:center
as well as updates to the navigation bar,


961
00:48:54,635 --> 00:48:56,570 line:-1
toolbars, the document menu,


962
00:48:56.603 --> 00:48:59.506 line:-2 align:center
that make it easy for your users
to manage documents


963
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,742 line:-1
and customize their experience.


964
00:49:01.775 --> 00:49:05.913 line:-2 align:center
To enable even more powerful applications
of iPad with connected hardware,


965
00:49:05.946 --> 00:49:07.915 line:-1 align:center
DriverKit comes to iPad,


966
00:49:07.948 --> 00:49:11.451 line:-2 align:center
helping to unlock
the incredible power of the M1 chip.


967
00:49:11,485 --> 00:49:14,154 line:-2
It's the same API
that's available on Mac today,


968
00:49:14.188 --> 00:49:18.525 line:-2 align:center
enabling you to easily deliver support
for your USB, audio,


969
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,428 line:-2
and PCI devices
to an even larger audience.


970
00:49:22.763 --> 00:49:27.000 line:-2 align:center
Now, watchOS is creating new opportunities
for apps through deeper integration


971
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:28,869 line:-1
with system services.


972
00:49:28.902 --> 00:49:31.405 line:-1 align:center
The CallKit framework in watchOS 9


973
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:33,907 line:-2
includes a new
Voiceover IP background mode


974
00:49:33.941 --> 00:49:37.377 line:-2 align:center
that lets apps make voice calls
directly from Apple Watch,


975
00:49:37.411 --> 00:49:42.049 line:-2 align:center
with the same familiar user experience
as FaceTime audio and phone calls.


976
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:45,452 line:-2
And Bluetooth-connected medical devices
get more robust connectivity


977
00:49:45.485 --> 00:49:46.854 line:-1 align:center
and data delivery,


978
00:49:46.887 --> 00:49:50.457 line:-2 align:center
allowing for timely alerts
when a critical condition is detected.


979
00:49:51.859 --> 00:49:55.796 line:-2 align:center
Now, tvOS 16 gives you new ways
to create connected experiences


980
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:57.564 line:-1 align:center
between your apps on Apple TV


981
00:49:57,598 --> 00:50:02,069 line:-2
and iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch apps
on nearby devices.


982
00:50:02.102 --> 00:50:05.239 line:-2 align:center
So a workout could use motion data
from Apple Watch,


983
00:50:05.272 --> 00:50:06.907 line:-1 align:center
or you could use iPhone or iPad


984
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,344 line:-2
as a custom controller
for your turn-based games,


985
00:50:10.377 --> 00:50:14.314 line:-2 align:center
And tvOS manages device discovery
and connection for you,


986
00:50:14.348 --> 00:50:16.617 line:-2 align:center
so your app doesn't even need
to be running on the other device.


987
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,886 line:-1
In fact, if your app isn't installed,


988
00:50:18,919 --> 00:50:21,421 line:-2
the user is automatically prompted
to download it


989
00:50:21,455 --> 00:50:23,090 line:-1
right from the App Store.


990
00:50:23.957 --> 00:50:27.861 line:-2 align:center
Now, for Phone and iPad,
there are new tools for advertisers.


991
00:50:27.895 --> 00:50:31.632 line:-2 align:center
We know that effective advertising
is important to a lot of your businesses,


992
00:50:31,665 --> 00:50:34,568 line:-1
which is why we created SKAdNetwork.


993
00:50:34.601 --> 00:50:37.371 line:-2 align:center
It's an API that helps ad networks
and advertisers


994
00:50:37.404 --> 00:50:40.741 line:-2 align:center
measure the performance of campaigns
without tracking users,


995
00:50:40.774 --> 00:50:45.112 line:-2 align:center
and we've been pleased to see
many third-party ad networks adopt it.


996
00:50:45.145 --> 00:50:47.848 line:-2 align:center
Now, we've heard feedback from
ad networks and developers,


997
00:50:47.881 --> 00:50:51.318 line:-2 align:center
and this year, we made a number
of improvements to SKAdNetwork


998
00:50:51.351 --> 00:50:53.187 line:-1 align:center
that reflect some of the biggest requests


999
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,656 line:-2
and give you
dramatically more flexibility,


1000
00:50:55,689 --> 00:50:58,825 line:-1
all without compromising user privacy.


1001
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,529 line:-2
Now, on iPhone and iPad,
there are new cool features


1002
00:51:02.563 --> 00:51:04.798 line:-1 align:center
that use AR and LiDAR scanning


1003
00:51:04.831 --> 00:51:07.201 line:-1 align:center
with ScanKit and RoomPlan.


1004
00:51:07.234 --> 00:51:11.038 line:-2 align:center
These APIs let your apps create
rich 3D parametric room models


1005
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:13,774 line:-1
in USD and USDZ formats.


1006
00:51:13.807 --> 00:51:16.910 line:-2 align:center
So you can create
a variety of workflows and experiences,


1007
00:51:16.944 --> 00:51:20.514 line:-2 align:center
from architecture and design,
to retail and hospitality,


1008
00:51:20,547 --> 00:51:24,117 line:-2
and the models include furniture
classification for categories


1009
00:51:24,151 --> 00:51:29,590 line:-2
such as sofas, cabinets, TVs,
and yes, even kitchen sinks.


1010
00:51:29.623 --> 00:51:34.094 line:-2 align:center
Now, last year, we introduced Focus
for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch,


1011
00:51:34,127 --> 00:51:39,800 line:-2
and with it, ways for your app to manage
notifications based on a user's Focus.


1012
00:51:39.833 --> 00:51:43.337 line:-2 align:center
And this year,
Focus goes further with Focus filters.


1013
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,940 line:-2
They're built on top of App Intents,
and Focus filters let you adjust


1014
00:51:46,974 --> 00:51:50,544 line:-2
the content of your app
based on the user's current focus.


1015
00:51:50.577 --> 00:51:53.380 line:-2 align:center
So, for example,
an app could create a Focus filter


1016
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:57,985 line:-2
to only show work accounts
when the user is in their Work Focus.


1017
00:51:58.018 --> 00:52:01.555 line:-2 align:center
And those examples are really
just scratching the surface.


1018
00:52:01,588 --> 00:52:04,625 line:-2
Across the board at every level,
there are new tools and APIs


1019
00:52:04.658 --> 00:52:08.529 line:-2 align:center
with the power that you need
to take your apps further than ever


1020
00:52:08,562 --> 00:52:11,265 line:-2
and to create entirely new apps
and experiences.


1021
00:52:11.298 --> 00:52:13.700 line:-1 align:center
So next, let's go a little deeper


1022
00:52:13.734 --> 00:52:18.205 line:-2 align:center
starting with Metal, a technology that's
really taking things to the next level.


1023
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:21,108 line:-1
And to tell you more, let's go to Sarah.


1024
00:52:21.141 --> 00:52:28.148 line:-1 align:center
♪ ♪


1025
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:32,452 align:center
Sarah Clawson: Metal is the powerful
graphics and compute API


1026
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:36,590 line:0
that helps you create amazing games
and pro apps for Apple platforms.


1027
00:52:36,623 --> 00:52:38,492 line:-1
Metal makes it easy to take advantage


1028
00:52:38.525 --> 00:52:42.062 line:-2 align:center
of the groundbreaking Apple GPUs
and unified memory system


1029
00:52:42.095 --> 00:52:45.165 line:-2 align:center
now spanning the latest iPhone,
iPad, and Mac lineups


1030
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:46,867 line:-1
shipping with Apple silicon.


1031
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,938 align:center
And this year, we're introducing Metal 3,


1032
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:52,673 line:0
with powerful new features that help you


1033
00:52:52.706 --> 00:52:53.841 line:-1 align:center
render immersive graphics


1034
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:55,442 line:-1
with even higher frame rates


1035
00:52:55.475 --> 00:52:56.643 line:-1 align:center
and enable new levels


1036
00:52:56.677 --> 00:52:58.478 line:-1 align:center
of computational performance.


1037
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:01,181 line:-2
For instance,
you'll get huge performance gains


1038
00:53:01.215 --> 00:53:03.350 line:-2 align:center
for the machine learning framework,
PyTorch,


1039
00:53:03.383 --> 00:53:05.252 line:-1 align:center
which now uses the new Metal backend


1040
00:53:05.285 --> 00:53:07.721 line:-1 align:center
to enable ML training with the GPU.


1041
00:53:07.754 --> 00:53:10.424 line:-1 align:center
And the biggest focus area is on gaming,


1042
00:53:10.457 --> 00:53:12.359 line:-1 align:center
starting with game loading,


1043
00:53:12,392 --> 00:53:14,661 line:-1
a key element to the gaming experience


1044
00:53:14.695 --> 00:53:17.364 line:-2 align:center
that can affect launch time
and loading new levels.


1045
00:53:17,397 --> 00:53:20,067 line:-2
Modern games deliver
a rich gaming experience


1046
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.436 line:-1 align:center
by providing high-quality assets,


1047
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:26,440 line:-2
and loading these assets quickly from
storage to the GPU can be challenging.


1048
00:53:26.473 --> 00:53:30.344 line:-2 align:center
Often, games will hide asset loading
behind a loading screen,


1049
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:32,846 line:-2
and one technique
to launch gameplay faster


1050
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.982 line:-2 align:center
is to load and draw
a lower quality version


1051
00:53:35.015 --> 00:53:37.651 line:-2 align:center
until the high-quality visuals
are available.


1052
00:53:37.684 --> 00:53:39.786 line:-1 align:center
This is not an ideal gaming experience


1053
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:43,323 line:-2
since the user sees
lower quality graphics for longer.


1054
00:53:43,357 --> 00:53:46,093 line:-1
Metal 3 introduces fast resource loading


1055
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:47,794 line:-1
with the Metal IO API


1056
00:53:47.828 --> 00:53:51.598 line:-2 align:center
that takes advantage of the Apple GPU's
unified memory architecture


1057
00:53:51,632 --> 00:53:53,267 line:-1
to minimize loading overhead


1058
00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.936 line:-2 align:center
and ensures
that the high-speed SSD storage


1059
00:53:55.969 --> 00:53:58.038 line:-1 align:center
that ships with every Apple silicon Mac


1060
00:53:58,071 --> 00:54:01,742 line:-2
has enough requests in its queues
to maximize throughput.


1061
00:54:01.775 --> 00:54:05.045 line:-2 align:center
This new API provides faster
and more consistent performance


1062
00:54:05.078 --> 00:54:07.981 line:-2 align:center
so that more time is spent
drawing at the ideal quality.


1063
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:12,319 line:-2
In addition to moving resources
from storage to memory,


1064
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:15,122 line:-2
game loading
is also about shader compilation.


1065
00:54:15.155 --> 00:54:16.924 line:-1 align:center
Shaders always need to be compiled


1066
00:54:16.957 --> 00:54:19.359 line:-2 align:center
for the user's unique
hardware configuration,


1067
00:54:19.393 --> 00:54:22.296 line:-2 align:center
and with the wide variety
of PC hardware permutations,


1068
00:54:22.329 --> 00:54:24.631 line:-1 align:center
this usually has to be done at runtime.


1069
00:54:24.665 --> 00:54:27.901 line:-2 align:center
This in-game compilation can affect
the gamer's experience


1070
00:54:27.935 --> 00:54:31.505 line:-2 align:center
causing dropped frames,
slower frame rates, and longer loading.


1071
00:54:31.538 --> 00:54:35.542 line:-2 align:center
In contrast, Apple silicon and Metal 3
are designed together


1072
00:54:35.576 --> 00:54:37.311 line:-1 align:center
to support all Apple devices.


1073
00:54:37.344 --> 00:54:39.713 line:-1 align:center
And now, with offline shader compilation,


1074
00:54:39,746 --> 00:54:43,350 line:-2
you can generate GPU shader binaries
at project build time,


1075
00:54:43.383 --> 00:54:46.320 line:-2 align:center
enabling you to eliminate
in-game shader compilation


1076
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:49,556 line:-2
to reduce load times
and improve rendering performance.


1077
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:54.294 line:-2 align:center
Another important aspect to gaming
is providing rich, detailed assets,


1078
00:54:54,328 --> 00:54:57,497 line:-2
and one way to increase the visual
fidelity of your game's graphics


1079
00:54:57,531 --> 00:55:01,502 line:-2
is by generating much more sophisticated
geometric meshes.


1080
00:55:01.535 --> 00:55:04.037 line:-2 align:center
Traditionally this is done
with a compute pass


1081
00:55:04,071 --> 00:55:06,507 line:-2
that'll evaluate the surface
and generate geometry


1082
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:08.609 line:-1 align:center
to be used in a later render pass.


1083
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:11,245 line:-2
The challenge is that
this can introduce latency


1084
00:55:11.278 --> 00:55:13.614 line:-2 align:center
and take an unpredictable
amount of memory.


1085
00:55:13.647 --> 00:55:16.650 line:-1 align:center
Metal 3 introduces a new Mesh Shading API,


1086
00:55:16.683 --> 00:55:20.821 line:-2 align:center
which gives you precise control over
an optimized geometry processing pipeline


1087
00:55:20.854 --> 00:55:22.456 line:-1 align:center
from a single render pass.


1088
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:25,359 line:-2
The Object shader decides
how many meshes to generate,


1089
00:55:25.392 --> 00:55:27.628 line:-2 align:center
and the Mesh shader
generates the actual geometry


1090
00:55:27.661 --> 00:55:30.063 line:-1 align:center
to be sent directly to the rasterizer,


1091
00:55:30,097 --> 00:55:33,433 line:-2
avoiding a trip to device memory
and increasing performance.


1092
00:55:33.467 --> 00:55:36.236 line:-2 align:center
Gamers also want to see
these stunning visuals


1093
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.005 line:-1 align:center
at the highest possible frame rate,


1094
00:55:38.038 --> 00:55:41.241 line:-2 align:center
but rendering advanced graphics
at ultra-high resolutions


1095
00:55:41,275 --> 00:55:42,976 line:-1
can cost precious milliseconds.


1096
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:46,246 line:-2
MetalFX upscaling helps
you render immersive graphics


1097
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,948 line:-1
in less time per frame.


1098
00:55:47.981 --> 00:55:49.516 line:-1 align:center
Here's how it works.


1099
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:52,986 line:-2
Previously, you would render
your full frame at native resolution,


1100
00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:56.423 line:-2 align:center
but the GPU render time
might not hit the target frame time.


1101
00:55:56.456 --> 00:56:00.260 line:-2 align:center
Now, you can render the same
complex scene at a lower resolution


1102
00:56:00.294 --> 00:56:03.363 line:-2 align:center
to meet the target frame times,
and use MetalFX framework


1103
00:56:03.397 --> 00:56:07.835 line:-2 align:center
to perform temporal antialiasing
and upscaling to the target resolution.


1104
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:10,804 line:-2
With Apple silicon and Metal 3's
optimized features,


1105
00:56:10.838 --> 00:56:13.273 line:-2 align:center
gaming has never looked so good
on the Mac.


1106
00:56:13,307 --> 00:56:14,975 line:-1
And developers agree.


1107
00:56:15.008 --> 00:56:18.412 line:-2 align:center
Leading game studios have plans to bring
their titles to the Mac,


1108
00:56:18.445 --> 00:56:21.448 line:-2 align:center
like Grid Legends,
taking advantage of Apple silicon


1109
00:56:21.481 --> 00:56:23.784 line:-1 align:center
to help you reach maximum speeds.


1110
00:56:23,817 --> 00:56:27,554 line:-2
Or Resident Evil Village,
using features like MetalFX upscaling


1111
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:31,525 line:-2
to deliver hauntingly beautiful scenes
at the highest resolution.


1112
00:56:31.558 --> 00:56:34.127 line:-2 align:center
And No Man's Sky,
taking advantage of Metal 3


1113
00:56:34.161 --> 00:56:35.963 line:-1 align:center
to explore rich, expansive worlds


1114
00:56:35,996 --> 00:56:37,731 line:-1
on both Mac and iPad.


1115
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:41,502 line:-2
Metal 3 is incredible,
with features to boost the performance


1116
00:56:41.535 --> 00:56:44.771 line:-2 align:center
of your apps
and provide an amazing gaming experience.


1117
00:56:44.805 --> 00:56:49.276 line:-2 align:center
Now to tell us more about the direction
MapKit is headed, here's Kathy.


1118
00:56:49,309 --> 00:56:51,445 line:-2
Kathy Lin: Whether you're navigating
to a favorite restaurant,


1119
00:56:51.478 --> 00:56:53.146 line:-1 align:center
planning that next vacation,


1120
00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:56.016 line:-2 align:center
or just checking where your favorite
food truck is parked on a map,


1121
00:56:56,049 --> 00:57:00,654 line:-2
we rely on our devices more than ever
to help us explore the world around us.


1122
00:57:00,687 --> 00:57:04,558 align:center
MapKit is the best way to help users
discover and navigate the world


1123
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:07,528 align:center
with rich and flexible mapping
and location services,


1124
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:11,632 line:-2
powered by Apple Maps
and available to developers for free.


1125
00:57:11,665 --> 00:57:15,836 line:-2
With MapKit, you can display map
or satellite imagery in your app,


1126
00:57:15.869 --> 00:57:17.771 line:-1 align:center
find and call out points of interest,


1127
00:57:17,804 --> 00:57:19,406 line:-1
add annotations and overlays,


1128
00:57:19.439 --> 00:57:21.575 line:-1 align:center
get directions, and more.


1129
00:57:21.608 --> 00:57:24.011 line:-1 align:center
MapKit is powered by our all-new map,


1130
00:57:24.044 --> 00:57:26.413 line:-1 align:center
built from the ground up by Apple.


1131
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:28,415 line:-1
It offers improved detail and accuracy,


1132
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:32,119 line:-2
and can bring useful mapping
and location services to your app.


1133
00:57:32.152 --> 00:57:34.588 line:-2 align:center
With iOS 16,
we're building on this map


1134
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:37,357 line:-2
to introduce our biggest update ever
for MapKit,


1135
00:57:37.391 --> 00:57:42.196 line:-2 align:center
starting with making the 3D City
Experience available to all developers.


1136
00:57:42,229 --> 00:57:45,199 line:-2
Users of your apps will be able
to see incredible details,


1137
00:57:45,232 --> 00:57:47,968 line:-1
like 3D elevation, turn lanes,


1138
00:57:48.001 --> 00:57:49.436 line:-1 align:center
crosswalks and bike lanes,


1139
00:57:49.469 --> 00:57:52.206 line:-1 align:center
and amazing handcrafted 3D landmarks


1140
00:57:52.239 --> 00:57:54.675 line:-2 align:center
like the Golden Gate Bridge,
or the Ferry Building.


1141
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:58,579 line:-2
The additional detail of the map allows
you to provide context and precision


1142
00:57:58,612 --> 00:58:01,348 line:-1
that was never before possible.


1143
00:58:01,381 --> 00:58:03,550 line:-2
You can, for example,
show that a point of interest


1144
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:07,054 line:-2
is between the crosswalk
and where the bike lane starts.


1145
00:58:07.087 --> 00:58:09.323 line:-1 align:center
No other digital map lets you do that,


1146
00:58:09.356 --> 00:58:12.526 line:-2 align:center
and we've made it incredibly easy
to implement.


1147
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,428 line:-2
To show you more,
let's create an experience


1148
00:58:14.461 --> 00:58:17.898 line:-2 align:center
that makes it easy for a user to find
where their favorite food truck is parked


1149
00:58:17,931 --> 00:58:20,567 line:-1
using the details of the new map.


1150
00:58:20.601 --> 00:58:23.971 line:-2 align:center
Map views like this one will automatically
get the 3D City Experience


1151
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:25,205 line:-1
where it's available.


1152
00:58:25.239 --> 00:58:28.408 line:-2 align:center
Just select iOS 16
as the deployment target.


1153
00:58:28.442 --> 00:58:31.745 line:-2 align:center
Next, I can utilize
the extraordinary detail of the map


1154
00:58:31,778 --> 00:58:35,482 line:-2
to illustrate the exact location
of the food truck.


1155
00:58:35.516 --> 00:58:39.520 line:-2 align:center
MapKit has powerful controls that allow us
to position the camera in 3D space


1156
00:58:39.553 --> 00:58:42.289 line:-1 align:center
to create a precise view of the map.


1157
00:58:42.322 --> 00:58:44.825 line:-2 align:center
Here, I can choose how far
we want to be zoomed in


1158
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:48,929 line:-2
by setting the distance of the center
coordinate of the camera to 600 meters.


1159
00:58:48.962 --> 00:58:52.165 line:-2 align:center
By adjusting the pitch and heading
and tilting the camera into 3D,


1160
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:55,169 line:-2
you can see amazing
and useful details like turn lanes,


1161
00:58:55.202 --> 00:58:57.938 line:-1 align:center
crosswalks, and even trees.


1162
00:58:57,971 --> 00:59:00,641 line:-1
By default, elevation will be flattened.


1163
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:03,577 line:-2
In order to help users understand
the terrain they'll encounter,


1164
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:07.981 line:-2 align:center
I can specify a preferredConfiguration
with elevationStyle 'realistic'


1165
00:59:08.015 --> 00:59:09.950 line:-1 align:center
to include 3D elevation.


1166
00:59:11,018 --> 00:59:15,422 line:-2
When adding an annotation or a route line
sourced from MapKit's Directions API,


1167
00:59:15.455 --> 00:59:17.624 line:-1 align:center
MapKit automatically handles elevation


1168
00:59:17.658 --> 00:59:20.093 line:-2 align:center
and will adjust the annotation
or route line


1169
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:23,997 line:-1
by placing it on top of the 3D terrain.


1170
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,633 line:-2
Animating the camera heading
by adding a slow pan


1171
00:59:26.667 --> 00:59:29.903 line:-1 align:center
really brings the map view to life.


1172
00:59:29,937 --> 00:59:31,605 line:-1
When a user switches into Dark Mode,


1173
00:59:31.638 --> 00:59:34.408 line:-2 align:center
the map will adjust together
with the rest of the UI.


1174
00:59:34.441 --> 00:59:37.344 line:-2 align:center
We're very excited to make
this immersive experience available


1175
00:59:37,377 --> 00:59:39,813 line:-1
to developers with iOS 16.


1176
00:59:39.847 --> 00:59:43.984 line:-2 align:center
In addition, we're also bringing another
popular Apple Maps feature to MapKit,


1177
00:59:44,017 --> 00:59:45,619 line:-1
Look Around,


1178
00:59:45,652 --> 00:59:49,122 line:-2
which is a great way
to explore the world at ground level,


1179
00:59:49.156 --> 00:59:52.559 line:-2 align:center
with high resolution 3D photography
and smooth animations.


1180
00:59:52,593 --> 00:59:55,462 line:-2
Users can simply tap
to move down the street.


1181
00:59:57,164 --> 01:00:00,067 line:-2
I can add a static Look Around preview
just below the map


1182
01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.770 line:-2 align:center
by dropping in a View Controller
and specifying a MapItem.


1183
01:00:03.804 --> 01:00:07.407 line:-2 align:center
The Look Around view automatically frames
the location correctly.


1184
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,776 line:-2
When a user taps on the preview,
I can choose to provide


1185
01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:11.678 line:-1 align:center
a full screen Look Around view,


1186
01:00:11,712 --> 01:00:13,647 line:-1
where users can see the address,


1187
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,516 line:-1
the date the imagery was collected,


1188
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:17.751 line:-1 align:center
and they can tap to move around freely


1189
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:20,587 line:-2
to get a better understanding
of their surroundings.


1190
01:00:20.621 --> 01:00:23.390 line:-2 align:center
There's one more new,
highly-requested capability


1191
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,193 line:-1
we're introducing to MapKit in iOS 16–


1192
01:00:26.226 --> 01:00:28.462 line:-1 align:center
Apple Maps Server APIs.


1193
01:00:28.495 --> 01:00:30.330 line:-1 align:center
Maps Server APIs are RESTful


1194
01:00:30.364 --> 01:00:33.534 line:-2 align:center
and support four of the most used
functions of MapKit:


1195
01:00:33.567 --> 01:00:36.703 line:-2 align:center
Geocode,
which turns a lat/long into an address;


1196
01:00:36.737 --> 01:00:39.039 line:-2 align:center
Reverse Geocode,
which does the opposite–


1197
01:00:39.072 --> 01:00:41.775 line:-1 align:center
it turns an address into GPS coordinates;


1198
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:44,278 line:-2
Search;
and Estimated Times of Arrival.


1199
01:00:44.311 --> 01:00:47.080 line:-2 align:center
Our new Maps Server APIs
are a great way


1200
01:00:47,114 --> 01:00:51,552 line:-2
to make your own backend services richer
and more performant.


1201
01:00:51.585 --> 01:00:53.887 line:-2 align:center
Of course,
MapKit is built from the ground up


1202
01:00:53,921 --> 01:00:56,156 line:-2
on the same foundation of privacy
as Apple Maps,


1203
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:59.393 line:-2 align:center
and does not associate users' data
with their identity


1204
01:00:59,426 --> 01:01:02,062 line:-1
or keep a history of where they've been.


1205
01:01:02,095 --> 01:01:05,666 line:-2
And that's a quick look at
what's new with MapKit in iOS 16.


1206
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:09,102 line:-2
Now for the weather, or at least
how you can build it into your app,


1207
01:01:09.136 --> 01:01:10.804 line:-1 align:center
here's Novall.


1208
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:15,142 align:center
Novall Khan: We announced today that we're
bringing the Weather app to iPad and Mac,


1209
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:17,544 line:0
and introducing powerful new features,


1210
01:01:17,578 --> 01:01:21,248 line:-2
including severe weather notifications,
rich detail views,


1211
01:01:21.281 --> 01:01:25.185 line:-2 align:center
and ten days of hourly temperature
and precipitation forecasts.


1212
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:29,423 line:-2
And there are all kinds of
other experiences across Apple devices


1213
01:01:29.456 --> 01:01:32.826 line:-2 align:center
and platforms that get better because
of the weather data we provide–


1214
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,462 line:-1
from asking Siri for today's forecast,


1215
01:01:35.495 --> 01:01:38.398 line:-1 align:center
to rerouting navigation around flooding.


1216
01:01:38,432 --> 01:01:42,202 line:-2
All of that is built on
our Apple Weather service.


1217
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:45,539 line:-2
Apple Weather delivers
a world-class global weather forecast


1218
01:01:45,572 --> 01:01:48,208 line:-2
using high-resolution
meteorological models


1219
01:01:48.242 --> 01:01:51.078 line:-2 align:center
combined with machine learning
and prediction algorithms.


1220
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:53,614 line:-1
Apple Weather provides current weather,


1221
01:01:53,647 --> 01:01:56,683 line:-1
10-day hourly forecasts, daily forecasts,


1222
01:01:56.717 --> 01:02:00.521 line:-2 align:center
and historical weather
so you can evaluate trends in data.


1223
01:02:00.554 --> 01:02:03.257 line:-2 align:center
Severe weather alerts
and minute-by-minute precipitation


1224
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:07,027 line:-2
are also available
for select countries around the world.


1225
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:10,497 line:-2
Forecasts feature 10 days
of hour-by-hour temperature,


1226
01:02:10,531 --> 01:02:13,166 line:-1
precipitation, UV index forecasts,


1227
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.535 line:-1 align:center
and much more.


1228
01:02:15.269 --> 01:02:19.339 line:-2 align:center
And all of this data is available to you
through WeatherKit.


1229
01:02:19,373 --> 01:02:23,377 line:0
WeatherKit is a native Swift API
for all Apple platforms,


1230
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,779 line:0
and a REST API you can use from anywhere.


1231
01:02:25,812 --> 01:02:29,616 line:-2
These APIs deliver accurate,
hyperlocal weather forecasts,


1232
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:33,954 line:-2
to help your users stay safe,
informed, and prepared.


1233
01:02:33.987 --> 01:02:36.356 line:-2 align:center
Let me show you how easy it is
to get weather information


1234
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:39,760 line:-2
through WeatherKit's great Swift API
in a quick demo.


1235
01:02:39.793 --> 01:02:42.029 line:-1 align:center
Let's revisit our Food Truck app.


1236
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:44,398 line:-2
To make sure my customers
don't get caught in the rain,


1237
01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:48.135 line:-2 align:center
my app is set up to recommend
a parking spot with clear skies.


1238
01:02:48.168 --> 01:02:50.637 line:-1 align:center
Let me show you how I can get the weather.


1239
01:02:50.671 --> 01:02:53.407 line:-1 align:center
Here I have a list of safe parking spots.


1240
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.276 line:-2 align:center
I've already added the WeatherKit
capability in Xcode,


1241
01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:58.712 line:-1 align:center
and all it takes is a few lines of code.


1242
01:02:58.745 --> 01:03:01.815 line:-2 align:center
With Swift Concurrency,
requesting weather is simple.


1243
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:06,186 line:-2
We call weather(for:) on WeatherService,
and pass in a location.


1244
01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:11.558 line:-2 align:center
Then I can get the relevant data
I need for my app, like condition,


1245
01:03:11.592 --> 01:03:14.494 line:-1 align:center
precipitation,


1246
01:03:14.528 --> 01:03:16.363 line:-1 align:center
and cloud cover.


1247
01:03:18.098 --> 01:03:21.235 line:-2 align:center
Now that I have the data I need
for each of my parking spots,


1248
01:03:21.268 --> 01:03:22.536 line:-1 align:center
when I run my app,


1249
01:03:22,569 --> 01:03:26,907 line:-2
my custom view has updated to
recommend a location with clear skies.


1250
01:03:28.675 --> 01:03:30.944 line:-2 align:center
There are all kinds of ways
you can use weather data


1251
01:03:30.978 --> 01:03:33.881 line:-2 align:center
to make the experiences
in your apps better.


1252
01:03:33.914 --> 01:03:36.783 line:-2 align:center
You might use weather forecasts
to help you with inventory,


1253
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:38,485 line:-2
predicting that
your ice-cream filled donuts


1254
01:03:38.519 --> 01:03:40.754 line:-2 align:center
are going to be a popular order
on a hot day,


1255
01:03:40.787 --> 01:03:43.290 line:-1 align:center
so you should stock up on ice cream.


1256
01:03:43.323 --> 01:03:45.459 line:-2 align:center
That's all it takes
to get the weather for our food truck,


1257
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:48,762 line:-2
and there's so much more
to uncover with WeatherKit.


1258
01:03:48.795 --> 01:03:51.131 line:-2 align:center
In keeping with Apple's commitment
to privacy,


1259
01:03:51.164 --> 01:03:54.368 line:-2 align:center
location is used
only to provide weather forecasts,


1260
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:57,671 line:-2
is not associated with
any personally identifying information,


1261
01:03:57.704 --> 01:04:00.541 line:-1 align:center
and is never shared or sold.


1262
01:04:00.574 --> 01:04:03.677 line:-2 align:center
Privacy is a shared responsibility,
and through WeatherKit,


1263
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:08.248 line:-2 align:center
you can get accurate weather data
while protecting user privacy.


1264
01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:11.418 line:-2 align:center
Because we want to make it easy for you
to get started with WeatherKit,


1265
01:04:11.451 --> 01:04:15.889 line:-2 align:center
we're including 500,000
weather(for:location) API calls per month


1266
01:04:15.923 --> 01:04:18.525 line:-2 align:center
in your Apple Developer Program
membership.


1267
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,262 line:-2
Those of you who need more will be able
to purchase additional tiers of service


1268
01:04:22,296 --> 01:04:24,831 line:-2
right in the developer app,
starting this fall.


1269
01:04:24.865 --> 01:04:28.969 line:-2 align:center
So that's WeatherKit,
accurate, hyperlocal weather forecasts


1270
01:04:29.002 --> 01:04:31.071 line:-1 align:center
powered by the Apple Weather service.


1271
01:04:31,104 --> 01:04:35,809 line:-2
We're starting with a beta,
and it's available now on all platforms.


1272
01:04:35,843 --> 01:04:40,080 line:-2
There are so many creative ways
that you can use WeatherKit in your apps.


1273
01:04:40.113 --> 01:04:42.216 line:-2 align:center
And now here's Ryan
to give us some perspective


1274
01:04:42.249 --> 01:04:44.518 line:-1 align:center
on what your apps can see with Live Text.


1275
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:47,221 line:0
Ryan Dixon:
Our users are loving Live Text,


1276
01:04:47,254 --> 01:04:48,689 line:0
and we have heard from many of you


1277
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:50,924 align:center
that you want to bring it
to your apps too.


1278
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:53,293 line:0
So this year,
we are expanding VisionKit


1279
01:04:53,327 --> 01:04:56,496 line:-2
with two new APIs
that will allow you to do just that.


1280
01:04:57.798 --> 01:05:01.869 line:-2 align:center
The Live Text API unlocks the ability
to analyze image content,


1281
01:05:01.902 --> 01:05:04.538 line:-2 align:center
allowing users to interact with text
and QR codes


1282
01:05:04.571 --> 01:05:07.541 line:-1 align:center
found in photos and paused video frames,


1283
01:05:07.574 --> 01:05:08.942 line:-1 align:center
and it provides quick actions


1284
01:05:08.976 --> 01:05:11.011 line:-1 align:center
so your users are just a tap away


1285
01:05:11.044 --> 01:05:13.547 line:-1 align:center
from taking action on relevant data.


1286
01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.916 line:-2 align:center
It's great for any app
that displays visual media,


1287
01:05:15.949 --> 01:05:19.553 line:-1 align:center
like Apollo for Reddit or Vimeo.


1288
01:05:19.586 --> 01:05:23.924 line:-2 align:center
And the Data Scanner API unlocks
the ability to analyze a live camera feed.


1289
01:05:23,957 --> 01:05:27,861 line:-2
It dramatically simplifies text
and barcode ingestion for users.


1290
01:05:27,895 --> 01:05:31,498 line:-2
All you need to do
is add any overlays or custom controls


1291
01:05:31.532 --> 01:05:35.335 line:-2 align:center
that tailor the live camera experience
to the needs of your app.


1292
01:05:35.369 --> 01:05:39.306 line:-2 align:center
This is especially useful for
consumer apps that rely on QR codes


1293
01:05:39.339 --> 01:05:42.709 line:-2 align:center
or enterprise apps built for
back-of-warehouse inventory management,


1294
01:05:42.743 --> 01:05:44.378 line:-1 align:center
pick-and pack delivery services,


1295
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:45,846 line:-1
and point of sale kiosks.


1296
01:05:46.713 --> 01:05:49.149 line:-1 align:center
Both the Live Text and Data Scanner APIs


1297
01:05:49,183 --> 01:05:51,818 line:-2
support automatic detection
of nine languages,


1298
01:05:51.852 --> 01:05:54.821 line:-2 align:center
including this year's additions
of Japanese and Korean.


1299
01:05:55.822 --> 01:05:59.459 line:-2 align:center
These VisionKit APIs will bring years
of computer vision innovation


1300
01:05:59,493 --> 01:06:02,563 line:-1
to your app with just a few lines of code.


1301
01:06:02.596 --> 01:06:04.598 line:-1 align:center
Here's Jenny to show you how.


1302
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:08,101 line:0
Jenny Chen: To show you a demo, we're back
to our trusty pop-up Food Truck app.


1303
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:11,638 line:-2
We're doing a promotion where if
users post a picture to a social channel


1304
01:06:11,672 --> 01:06:15,375 line:-2
holding a sign up with the hashtag
#freedonut and their address on the app,


1305
01:06:15.409 --> 01:06:18.378 line:-2 align:center
we'll drive to their address
and deliver a free donut to them.


1306
01:06:18,412 --> 01:06:20,314 line:-1
We'll head to our social donut feed.


1307
01:06:20,347 --> 01:06:23,584 line:-2
We want to add Live Text to the images
so that drivers can extract the text


1308
01:06:23.617 --> 01:06:25.819 line:-1 align:center
to get the addresses for delivery.


1309
01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.389 line:-2 align:center
Here's where the new Live Text APIs
play in.


1310
01:06:29,423 --> 01:06:32,492 line:-2
I can easily add an ImageInteraction
on top of my view,


1311
01:06:32.526 --> 01:06:36.063 line:-2 align:center
and that will add the Live Text button
with quick action support to it.


1312
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:39,299 line:-2
While the Live Text button
normally sits on the bottom right,


1313
01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:41.568 line:-1 align:center
I already have a heart button in my app,


1314
01:06:41,602 --> 01:06:44,404 line:-2
so I can adjust the placement
using custom insets.


1315
01:06:44.438 --> 01:06:48.442 line:-2 align:center
I can also set the button configuration
to customize the style of the button


1316
01:06:48.475 --> 01:06:50.744 line:-1 align:center
so that it matches my app better.


1317
01:06:50.777 --> 01:06:55.015 line:-2 align:center
Now that I've added it in,
I can tap the Live Text button,


1318
01:06:55.048 --> 01:06:56.483 line:-1 align:center
select the text,


1319
01:06:56.517 --> 01:06:59.086 line:-2 align:center
or use quick actions
to easily grab the address.


1320
01:07:00,654 --> 01:07:03,824 line:-2
I love that users don't have to learn
a new interaction model,


1321
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:08,462 line:-2
as it provides the same ease of use
with the Live Text experience.


1322
01:07:08.495 --> 01:07:10.597 line:-1 align:center
The UI is consistent and familiar.


1323
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:12,666 line:-1
It feels integrated with the OS,


1324
01:07:12.699 --> 01:07:16.670 line:-2 align:center
but I can still adjust the placement
even when I have my own custom UI.


1325
01:07:17.404 --> 01:07:19.439 line:-1 align:center
Of course, like any good delivery app,


1326
01:07:19,473 --> 01:07:22,643 line:-2
we also want to provide
the best service to our customers


1327
01:07:22.676 --> 01:07:25.646 line:-2 align:center
and make sure
we're giving people the right donuts.


1328
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,149 line:-1
So we track our donut orders via QR code.


1329
01:07:29.183 --> 01:07:33.587 line:-2 align:center
Using the new Data Scanner APIs,
I can easily add that as the first step


1330
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:36,089 line:-1
of any customer interaction.


1331
01:07:36.123 --> 01:07:38.192 line:-2 align:center
Right now,
that button doesn't do anything,


1332
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:41,261 line:-2
but I can easily instantiate
a new DataScanner object


1333
01:07:41,295 --> 01:07:44,398 line:-1
that looks for text, QR codes, or barcodes


1334
01:07:44,431 --> 01:07:46,633 line:-1
that I can then import into my app.


1335
01:07:46.667 --> 01:07:49.336 line:-2 align:center
With just a few lines of code,
I can bring up the camera,


1336
01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:53.540 line:-2 align:center
specify that I want QR codes,
and startScanning!


1337
01:07:53.574 --> 01:07:55.709 line:-1 align:center
When the driver taps on the QR code,


1338
01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:58.178 line:-1 align:center
I want to show that the scan is a success.


1339
01:07:58,212 --> 01:08:00,314 line:-2
I'll add in the delegate handler
in Xcode...


1340
01:08:03.684 --> 01:08:06.019 line:-1 align:center
...and on tap, show an alert to the user


1341
01:08:06.053 --> 01:08:07.521 line:-1 align:center
that the scan was a success


1342
01:08:07,554 --> 01:08:10,424 line:-2
so that I can go ahead
and get the donut order started.


1343
01:08:10.457 --> 01:08:14.394 line:-2 align:center
Now when I run the app,
this brings up a view controller


1344
01:08:14.428 --> 01:08:17.097 line:-2 align:center
with the camera view,
and I can see the guidance


1345
01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:20.367 line:-2 align:center
and the reticle view
highlighting the QR code.


1346
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,737 line:-2
When I tap on the QR code,
I can see my scan was a success


1347
01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:26.139 line:-1 align:center
and the donut order is confirmed.


1348
01:08:26,173 --> 01:08:30,611 line:-2
And with that,
my #freedonut delivery is on its way.


1349
01:08:30.644 --> 01:08:34.615 line:-2 align:center
With VisionKit,
the new Live Text and Data Scanner APIs


1350
01:08:34,648 --> 01:08:39,086 line:-2
easily allow you to bring these
powerful vision capabilities to your app.


1351
01:08:39.119 --> 01:08:41.455 line:-1 align:center
And now, back to Susan.


1352
01:08:41,488 --> 01:08:44,892 line:-2
Susan: This is an exciting time
to be building apps.


1353
01:08:44.925 --> 01:08:49.396 line:-2 align:center
Xcode Cloud is now ready
to help you build better apps faster.


1354
01:08:49.429 --> 01:08:52.432 line:-2 align:center
With Swift and SwiftUI,
it's easier than ever


1355
01:08:52.466 --> 01:08:57.738 line:-2 align:center
to transform your ideas into apps
that work across Apple platforms.


1356
01:08:57,771 --> 01:09:00,474 line:-2
There are cool new ways for your apps
to bring your ideas


1357
01:09:00,507 --> 01:09:02,943 line:-1
deeper into the system experience.


1358
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:05,045 line:-1
Lock Screen widgets and Live Activities


1359
01:09:05.078 --> 01:09:07.648 line:-1 align:center
bring your app to the Lock Screen.


1360
01:09:07,681 --> 01:09:10,417 line:-2
Messages Collaboration
makes it incredibly easy


1361
01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:13.520 line:-1 align:center
for your users to connect and collaborate.


1362
01:09:13.554 --> 01:09:17.958 line:-2 align:center
And App Intents
help integrate your app with Siri.


1363
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:19,993 line:-1
There are entirely new APIs


1364
01:09:20,027 --> 01:09:22,529 line:-1
and major updates to existing APIs,


1365
01:09:22.563 --> 01:09:27.167 line:-2 align:center
like WeatherKit, MapKit,
Live Text, and Metal.


1366
01:09:27.201 --> 01:09:29.036 line:-1 align:center
And that's not the end of the story.


1367
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:32,239 line:-1
It's another big WWDC this year,


1368
01:09:32,272 --> 01:09:34,408 line:-1
with 175 sessions,


1369
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:39,179 line:-2
hundreds of labs, and Digital Lounge
activities running all week.


1370
01:09:39.213 --> 01:09:41.481 line:-2 align:center
We can't wait to connect with you
this week,


1371
01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:44.685 line:-2 align:center
and more importantly,
this week is for you.


1372
01:09:44.718 --> 01:09:47.588 line:-1 align:center
We're eager to see what you create next.


1373
01:09:47.621 --> 01:09:49.256 line:-1 align:center
