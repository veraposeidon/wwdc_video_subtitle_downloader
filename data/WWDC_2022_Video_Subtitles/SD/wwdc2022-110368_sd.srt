Franklin Schrans: Hello,
my name is Franklin,


5
00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.513 line:-1 position:50%
and I'm an engineer
on the Swift-DocC team.


6
00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.115 line:-1 position:50%
Together with
my colleague Ethan,


7
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:19,219 line:-1
I'm excited to give you a tour
of Swift-DocC in Xcode 14,


8
00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.821 line:-1 position:50%
packed with great new tools


9
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:24,024 line:-1
to help you create
even better documentation.


10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,494 line:-1
We introduced Swift-DocC
last year in Xcode 13,


11
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:31,765 line:-1
allowing you to guide developers
through your Swift frameworks.


12
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:35,035 line:0
With Swift-DocC,
you write comprehensive content,


13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,005 position:50%
from reference documentation
for individual APIs


14
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:41,308 position:50%
to conceptual articles that
provide a higher-level story


15
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,343 position:50%
for using these APIs together,


16
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,545 position:50%
all the way
to step-by-step tutorials


17
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,882 line:0
that walk the user
through a task.


18
00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.784 line:-1 position:50%
This year, with Xcode 14,


19
00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:54.288 line:-1 position:50%
Swift-DocC unlocks
brand-new, exciting workflows.


20
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,590 line:-1
In addition to documenting
frameworks,


21
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,826 line:-1
we're thrilled to now
support app projects as well,


22
00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.663 line:-1 position:50%
so that you can easily
collaborate with your team.


23
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:06,233 line:-1
You can now also document
Objective-C and C APIs


24
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,235 line:-1
using Swift-DocC,
allowing you


25
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,838 line:-1
to describe all your project's
APIs together.


26
00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.473 line:-1 position:50%
Publishing your content
to a website


27
00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:17.044 line:-1 position:50%
is now dramatically easier,
with out-of-the-box support


28
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:20,347 line:-1
for static hosting environments
like GitHub Pages.


29
00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:23.216 line:-1 position:50%
And thanks to the powerful new
navigation sidebar,


30
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,852 line:-1
developers will be able
to discover your content


31
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,355 line:-1
easier than ever before.


32
00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.758 line:-1 position:50%
Also, with Swift-DocC now being
an open source project,


33
00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.193 line:-1 position:50%
these new features
were developed


34
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:37,130 line:-1
in close collaboration
with the open source community.


35
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,999 line:-1
In this session,
we'll take a tour of Swift-DocC


36
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:44,004 line:-1
and the exciting new workflows
it unlocks in Xcode 14.


37
00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:47.341 line:-1 position:50%
First, we'll discover how
to document your project's APIs


38
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,910 line:-1
right inline with
your source code.


39
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.678 line:-1 position:50%
Then, we'll take a look
at seamlessly


40
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,581 line:-1
publishing your content
to a website.


41
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:55.949 line:-1 position:50%
And finally, we'll discover


42
00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:59.920 line:-1 position:50%
the brand-new navigation sidebar
on the web.


43
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.090 line:-1 position:50%
Let's start with
writing documentation.


44
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.927 line:-1 position:50%
Good documentation is essential
to any software project.


45
00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.061 line:-1 position:50%
As your project evolves,


46
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,131 line:-1
it's important to describe
its functionality and design


47
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.333 line:-1 position:50%
so that developers
have a solid reference point


48
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.035 line:-1 position:50%
when contributing.


49
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,604 line:-1
Swift-DocC in Xcode
gives you the tools you need


50
00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.840 line:-1 position:50%
to create fantastic
documentation,


51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,976 line:-1
using the same tools you use
to develop code.


52
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.478 line:-1 position:50%
And this year,
we're excited


53
00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.748 line:-1 position:50%
to expand Swift-DocC
to app projects.


54
00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:29.950 line:-1 position:50%
Let's dive right in.


55
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,052 line:-1
We'll document an app
I'm working on with my team


56
00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:33.320 line:-1 position:50%
called Slothy,


57
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,557 line:-1
which contains both Swift
and Objective-C source files.


58
00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.192 line:-1 position:50%
Even with a brand-new project,


59
00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:41.561 line:-1 position:50%
where I haven't written
documentation yet,


60
00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:46.233 line:-1 position:50%
you can open the Product menu
and select Build Documentation,


61
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,136 line:-1
and Xcode opens
the documentation window,


62
00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:51.405 line:-1 position:50%
where you'll see stubs
that Swift-DocC


63
00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:54.141 line:-1 position:50%
automatically generates
for your APIs.


64
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,811 line:-1
This provides a great starting
point for filling in these pages


65
00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:00.847 line:-1 position:50%
to help contributors
navigate the project.


66
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,117 line:-1
So, let's take it step by step
to turn this content


67
00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:09.256 line:-1 position:50%
into a rich and complete guide
for contributing to our app.


68
00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:12.259 line:-1 position:50%
A good place to start
is to teach how each API


69
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,361 line:-1
works individually,
and from there,


70
00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:18.698 line:-1 position:50%
to provide higher-level content
using a documentation catalog.


71
00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:22.269 line:-1 position:50%
Let's start by describing
a view called SlothView.


72
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,539 line:-1
For this documentation
to be visible to Swift-DocC,


73
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,608 line:-1
start your comment
using three slashes.


74
00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:31.845 line:-1 position:50%
Then, add a concise summary
for your view.


75
00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:35.148 line:-1 position:50%
In the built documentation page,
this translates to text


76
00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:38.785 line:-1 position:50%
displayed prominently
right below the view's name.


77
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,489 line:-1
Then, add more details
using additional paragraphs.


78
00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.326 line:-1 position:50%
This content appears in the
Overview section of the page.


79
00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:50.263 line:-1 position:50%
And use Swift-DocC's link syntax
to turn references to APIs


80
00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:52.099 line:-1 position:50%
into active links,


81
00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.802 line:-1 position:50%
allowing you to quickly jump
to Pages to learn more.


82
00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:58.572 line:-1 position:50%
DocC even validates these links
when you build,


83
00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:01.808 line:-1 position:50%
so you get warnings
if they go out of date.


84
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,311 line:-1
Finally, if you wish
to provide an example


85
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,779 line:-1
of how to use this view,


86
00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:09.583 line:-1 position:50%
add a code listing using the
Markdown code block syntax.


87
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,785 line:-1
Now, contributors know
at a glance


88
00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:14.421 line:-1 position:50%
how to use this view.


89
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,124 line:-1
In just a few steps,
my view's documentation


90
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:21,161 line:-1
is now much more helpful
to contributors of this project.


91
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.865 line:-1 position:50%
Next up, let's document
an initializer.


92
00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:27.734 line:-1 position:50%
Again, start by writing
a summary.


93
00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.202 line:-1 position:50%
For initializers and methods,


94
00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:33.273 line:-1 position:50%
it's a good idea to describe
each parameter individually.


95
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.742 line:-1 position:50%
You do so by adding
a parameter list item,


96
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,112 line:-1
with a short description
of what the parameter is.


97
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,447 line:-1
Notice how the content appears


98
00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.884 line:-1 position:50%
in a separate
Parameters section.


99
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,887 line:-1
Now let's take a look
at the Objective-C APIs


100
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,089 line:-1
defined in this project.


101
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,858 line:-1
New in Xcode 14,
we're excited to bring


102
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,994 line:-1
Swift-DocC's
comprehensive tooling


103
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,396 line:-1
to document Objective-C code.


104
00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:59.599 line:-1 position:50%
Using the same familiar Markdown
syntax you know and love,


105
00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.035 line:-1 position:50%
and updated support
in Xcode's source editor,


106
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,171 line:-1
you can now
describe and organize


107
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,040 line:-1
all your project's APIs
together.


108
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.243 line:-1 position:50%
And for code that can be called
from both Swift and Objective-C,


109
00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:11.611 line:-1 position:50%
there's a nifty language toggle


110
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,182 line:-1
to browse the page in
the language you're coding in.


111
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,684 line:-1
Check out the developer
documentation linked below


112
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,020 line:-1
for more details.


113
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.890 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let's apply this
to our Slothy project.


114
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,527 line:-1
I'll describe the SLOSound class
and its initializer.


115
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,762 line:-1
Notice that because this class


116
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,932 line:-1
can be used from both Swift
and Objective-C code,


117
00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:34.401 line:-1 position:50%
Xcode displays a language toggle
allowing you


118
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,938 line:-1
to browse the content
in the language you're using.


119
00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:40.173 line:-1 position:50%
Let's describe the class
and initializer


120
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:45,011 line:-1
using the same Markdown syntax
you use for Swift code.


121
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.113 line:-1 position:50%
Great, this looks much better.


122
00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.449 line:-1 position:50%
I've added a summary,
an overview,


123
00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.019 line:-1 position:50%
and for the initializer,
a parameters section.


124
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,922 line:-1
And that wraps up
describing individual APIs.


125
00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:58.992 line:-1 position:50%
By writing a few documentation
comments in source code,


126
00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:00.894 line:-1 position:50%
developers contributing
to my project


127
00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:04.764 line:-1 position:50%
have a better understanding
of how to use its APIs.


128
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,667 line:-1
Now, let's focus on creating
a great top-level page


129
00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:08.935 line:-1 position:50%
for our app.


130
00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:11.504 line:-1 position:50%
This is the first page
contributors will see,


131
00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.974 line:-1 position:50%
so I'd like to provide
a great introduction


132
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,811 line:-1
to what the app does
and how to contribute to it.


133
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:19.646 line:-1 position:50%
To customize the top-level page,


134
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:23,283 line:-1
start by adding
a documentation catalog.


135
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,953 line:-1
To do so, right-click
on your project's source folder


136
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,422 line:-1
and select New File.


137
00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:32.525 line:-1 position:50%
Then select
Documentation Catalog.


138
00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.427 line:-1 position:50%
A Documentation Catalog


139
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,630 line:-1
complements your
source code documentation


140
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.267 line:-1 position:50%
and contains additional
Markdown files and media.


141
00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:42.135 line:-1 position:50%
Xcode automatically adds a file


142
00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:44.437 line:-1 position:50%
for the top-level page
of your app.


143
00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:48.742 line:-1 position:50%
Let's fill it in with an
overview of what the app does.


144
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,845 line:-1
Using the same syntax you use
for documentation comments


145
00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:54.114 line:-1 position:50%
in source code,
I added a summary,


146
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:58,618 line:-1
an overview, and even embedded
rich content like images.


147
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,288 line:-1
Great, this looks
much more inviting.


148
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:06,059 line:-1
Now contributors know at a
glance what my app is about.


149
00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:06.926 line:-1 position:50%
And that's it!


150
00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.462 line:-1 position:50%
I've dramatically improved
documentation for my app


151
00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:11.431 line:-1 position:50%
and provided
a great reference point


152
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,433 line:-1
to my project's contributors.


153
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.001 line:-1 position:50%
They can browse
the top-level page


154
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,138 line:-1
for an overview of the project,
and jump into each page


155
00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:23.076 line:-1 position:50%
to get detailed information
about each of its APIs.


156
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,112 line:-1
Now that we've seen how to write
and build documentation,


157
00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.381 line:-1 position:50%
it's time to publish it
to a website


158
00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:31.484 line:-1 position:50%
so that contributors
can easily browse it.


159
00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:33.486 line:-1 position:50%
Over to you, Ethan.


160
00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:35.155 line:-1 position:50%
Ethan Kusters: Thank you,
Franklin.


161
00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:38.325 line:-1 position:50%
We've been developing
the Slothy app in a modular way


162
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,528 line:-1
alongside a more generally
useful Swift Package


163
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,730 line:-1
called SlothCreator.


164
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.832 line:-1 position:50%
I think it would be great
to publish SlothCreator


165
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,234 line:-1
to a wider audience
so that other developers


166
00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:51.204 line:-1 position:50%
making sloth-related apps
can make use of it.


167
00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:53.573 line:-1 position:50%
As a part of this effort,
I want to be sure


168
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:57,210 line:-1
SlothCreator's documentation
is easily shareable on the web,


169
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.846 line:-1 position:50%
so let's walk through
Swift-DocC's brand-new,


170
00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:03.283 line:-1 position:50%
simplified publishing workflow.


171
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,385 line:-1
When you build documentation
in Xcode,


172
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,721 line:-1
Swift-DocC produces
a static bundle


173
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,756 line:-1
containing your documentation.


174
00:08:09.756 --> 00:08:12.225 line:-1 position:50%
This bundle is called
a DocC archive


175
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,829 line:-1
and is a portable container
for your documentation.


176
00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:19.032 line:-1 position:50%
You can export it directly from
Xcode's documentation window


177
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,000 line:-1
and send it to colleagues.


178
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.269 line:-1 position:50%
They'll be able to open
and browse the documentation


179
00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:26.106 line:-1 position:50%
by just double-clicking
on the archive.


180
00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:28.842 line:-1 position:50%
But a DocC archive isn't just
a portable container


181
00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.111 line:-1 position:50%
for opening documentation
in Xcode.


182
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,580 line:-1
It also contains
a fully featured website


183
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.048 line:-1 position:50%
right out of the box.


184
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,684 line:-1
And new in Xcode 14,
that DocC archive


185
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,787 line:-1
is also directly compatible
with most web servers.


186
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:43,022 line:-1
This makes publishing
your documentation to the web


187
00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.891 line:-1 position:50%
easier than ever.


188
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:47.360 line:-1 position:50%
In most cases, you can
deploy your documentation


189
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,563 line:-1
by just copying the contents
of your built DocC archive


190
00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:53.133 line:-1 position:50%
into the root
of your web server.


191
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,068 line:-1
This also means
that DocC archives


192
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,371 line:-1
are now compatible with most
managed hosting services,


193
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,840 line:-1
including GitHub Pages.


194
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.642 line:-1 position:50%
GitHub Pages is a popular way


195
00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:04.778 line:-1 position:50%
many developers
host their documentation


196
00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:07.714 line:-1 position:50%
that's integrated
right into GitHub.com.


197
00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:08.948 line:-1 position:50%
And since we've been
using GitHub


198
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,084 line:-1
for the source control
of SlothCreator,


199
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,486 line:-1
it makes sense for us to publish
our documentation there


200
00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:14.554 line:-1 position:50%
as well.


201
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,856 line:-1
If you're familiar
with using GitHub pages,


202
00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:18.992 line:-1 position:50%
you'll know that,
unlike a standard server,


203
00:09:18.992 --> 00:09:22.162 line:-1 position:50%
your website is not published
at the root path of the URL


204
00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:24.497 line:-1 position:50%
but at a specific base path.


205
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,232 line:-1
In this kind
of hosting scenario,


206
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.902 line:-1 position:50%
you'll need to specify
your website's base path


207
00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.303 line:-1 position:50%
with an additional build setting


208
00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:33.406 line:-1 position:50%
to produce a DocC archive
that's compatible.


209
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,874 line:-1
To fully understand
how this works


210
00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.443 line:-1 position:50%
and why we only need
this configuration


211
00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:40.180 line:-1 position:50%
in certain hosting scenarios --
like on GitHub Pages --


212
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,415 line:-1
let's take a look at how
we would expect the URL


213
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,886 line:-1
of a DocC archive hosted
on your own domain might look.


214
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,689 line:-1
Let's assume we already have
a website for the Slothy app --


215
00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:52.192 line:-1 position:50%
slothy.example.com --


216
00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:55.462 line:-1 position:50%
and we'd like to publish the
documentation for SlothCreator


217
00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:58.832 line:-1 position:50%
as a part of that
existing website.


218
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:02,035 line:-1
If we just take the content of
the SlothCreator DocC archive


219
00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:04.204 line:-1 position:50%
and copy it to the root
of our web server,


220
00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:07.140 line:-1 position:50%
the reference documentation
for SlothCreator will appear


221
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:14.514 line:-1 position:50%
at slothy.example.com/
documentation/slothcreator.


222
00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:17.016 line:-1 position:50%
Any tutorials for
the SlothCreator package


223
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,186 line:-1
would be at a neighboring
"tutorials" path.


224
00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.956 line:-1 position:50%
However, in this case,
we're not going to be publishing


225
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.123 line:-1 position:50%
to our own domain.


226
00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.092 line:-1 position:50%
Instead, to keep
the documentation


227
00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:28.261 line:-1 position:50%
with our GitHub repository,


228
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,531 line:-1
we'll publish to the domain
GitHub Pages provides.


229
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:34,367 line:-1
When you create a GitHub
Pages site for a repository,


230
00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:37.537 line:-1 position:50%
the URL of that website
is not at the root path;


231
00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:39.706 line:-1 position:50%
instead, it's at
a specific base path


232
00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:43.409 line:-1 position:50%
corresponding to the name
of the repository.


233
00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:46.913 line:-1 position:50%
Generally that will be something
like your username.github.io


234
00:10:46.913 --> 00:10:50.984 line:-1 position:50%
forward-slash
your repository name.


235
00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.686 line:-1 position:50%
Any reference and tutorial
documentation paths


236
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,155 line:-1
are appended to that base path.


237
00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:59.092 line:-1 position:50%
Because this base path
is unique to your repository,


238
00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:01.127 line:-1 position:50%
it's important to tell
Swift-DocC what it is


239
00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:05.932 line:-1 position:50%
before building a DocC archive
for publishing to GitHub Pages.


240
00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:08.368 line:-1 position:50%
There's a new build setting
exposed in Xcode 14


241
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,537 line:-1
for just this use case.


242
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,371 line:-1
After configuring


243
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:14.374 line:-1 position:50%
the DocC Archive Hosting
Base Path setting


244
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,543 line:-1
to be the name
of your GitHub repository,


245
00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:17.544 line:-1 position:50%
you'll be ready to go


246
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:20,113 line:-1
for all of your future
documentation builds.


247
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:23,116 line:-1
Let's take a look at how
this works in practice.


248
00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:25.451 line:-1 position:50%
Here, I've opened the
SlothCreator Swift package


249
00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:26.753 line:-1 position:50%
Franklin showed you earlier


250
00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:29.789 line:-1 position:50%
as a dependency
of the Slothy app.


251
00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:31.491 line:-1 position:50%
Since we're getting close
to publishing this package


252
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,293 line:-1
for wider use,
I'm going to go ahead


253
00:11:33.293 --> 00:11:37.397 line:-1 position:50%
and publish the documentation
we've prepared to GitHub Pages.


254
00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:39.999 line:-1 position:50%
I'll begin by opening the
framework's project settings


255
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,869 line:-1
by moving my mouse
to Xcode's Project navigator


256
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,306 line:-1
and selecting
the SlothCreator item.


257
00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:49.275 line:-1 position:50%
Next, I'll select
the SlothCreator target,


258
00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:52.378 line:-1 position:50%
and then open
the Build Settings tab.


259
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,415 line:-1
In this case, I'm looking for
a Swift-DocC-related setting,


260
00:11:55,415 --> 00:12:00,420 line:-1
so let's filter for DocC.


261
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.591 line:-1 position:50%
Now I'll set the DocC Archive
Hosting Base Path setting


262
00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:10.830 line:-1 position:50%
to be the name of our
repository: sloth-creator.


263
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,698 line:-1
Great!


264
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,500 line:-1
Next, let's build documentation.


265
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.503 line:-1 position:50%
I'll move my mouse
up to the Product menu


266
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,374 line:-1
and select Build
documentation.


267
00:12:21.374 --> 00:12:23.643 line:-1 position:50%
After Xcode finishes
compiling my project


268
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,578 line:-1
and generating
documentation for it,


269
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:28.047 line:-1 position:50%
the documentation window
will open.


270
00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:31.417 line:-1 position:50%
Here's the top-level page for
SlothCreator's documentation.


271
00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:34.053 line:-1 position:50%
Let's go ahead and export it.


272
00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:36.589 line:-1 position:50%
I'll move my mouse over
to the documentation navigator


273
00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.359 line:-1 position:50%
and the SlothCreator
technology item.


274
00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:44.731 line:-1 position:50%
Next I'll click on the
context menu and select Export.


275
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,634 line:-1
I'm going to export it
to a directory named "docs"


276
00:12:47.634 --> 00:12:49.602 line:-1 position:50%
in the root of my repository


277
00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.838 line:-1 position:50%
because this is how
I've configured GitHub Pages


278
00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:54.841 line:-1 position:50%
to publish
my documentation website.


279
00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:02.749 line:-1 position:50%
Now I just need to commit and
push my changes up to GitHub.


280
00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:05.485 line:-1 position:50%
Back in the main Xcode window,


281
00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:08.187 line:-1 position:50%
I'll move my mouse
up to the Source Control menu


282
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,390 line:-1
and select Commit.


283
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.158 line:-1 position:50%
I'll select the docs directory


284
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,761 line:-1
that has
my documentation content


285
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:16.963 line:-1 position:50%
and write a commit message.


286
00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.799 line:-1 position:50%
Let's go ahead
and push the changes.


287
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,072 line:-1
And that's it.


288
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,874 line:-1
Let's go check out
the published site.


289
00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:30.877 line:-1 position:50%
I'll open up my repository
on GitHub.com.


290
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.782 line:-1 position:50%
I'd already placed a link
to the documentation site


291
00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:39.819 line:-1 position:50%
in the README,
so I'll just click on it.


292
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,988 line:-1
And here we are.


293
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,923 line:-1
I'm so excited to have
the documentation


294
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,026 line:-1
we worked on for SlothCreator
easily accessible on the web.


295
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,128 line:-1
I think this is going to be
really helpful for folks


296
00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:53.299 line:-1 position:50%
interested in using SlothCreator
in their own projects.


297
00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:55.134 line:-1 position:50%
Now that we've deployed
the documentation


298
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,736 line:-1
for SlothCreator once,


299
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,571 line:-1
I'd really like
to set up automation


300
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,539 line:-1
to perform a deployment


301
00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:03.843 line:-1 position:50%
any time the documentation
in the repository changes.


302
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,813 line:-1
Since we're releasing
SlothCreator as a Swift Package,


303
00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:09.682 line:-1 position:50%
the new Swift-DocC
Swift Package Manager plug-in


304
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,818 line:-1
is going to be
a great help here.


305
00:14:11.818 --> 00:14:13.619 line:-1 position:50%
You can use
the Swift-DocC plug-in


306
00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:16.723 line:-1 position:50%
to really simplify the process
of building documentation


307
00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:18.658 line:-1 position:50%
for Swift packages.


308
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,460 line:-1
The plug-in's documentation
is linked below


309
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.894 line:-1 position:50%
and I recommend
checking it out


310
00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:24.297 line:-1 position:50%
as a great starting place
for configuring automated


311
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,733 line:-1
documentation deployments
to GitHub Pages


312
00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:29.268 line:-1 position:50%
and other hosting services.


313
00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:31.304 line:-1 position:50%
And of course, Swift-DocC
continues to have


314
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,740 line:-1
great command-line support
for Xcode projects


315
00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.676 line:-1 position:50%
with the xcodebuild docbuild
command-line interface


316
00:14:36.676 --> 00:14:39.212 line:-1 position:50%
that was introduced
in Xcode 13.


317
00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:42.048 line:-1 position:50%
Documentation for how
to get started using xcodebuild


318
00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:46.385 line:-1 position:50%
to automate GitHub Pages
deployments is linked below.


319
00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:49.822 line:-1 position:50%
We're thrilled to be releasing
an all-new enhanced browsing


320
00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:53.593 line:-1 position:50%
and navigation experience for
Swift-DocC on the web this year.


321
00:14:53.593 --> 00:14:56.629 line:-1 position:50%
Let's take a look at how
the new navigation sidebar


322
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,998 line:-1
can help readers of the
SlothCreator documentation


323
00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:02.135 line:-1 position:50%
explore what the framework
has to offer.


324
00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:04.504 line:-1 position:50%
We're back on the GitHub Pages
site for SlothCreator,


325
00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:06.239 line:-1 position:50%
and over on the left side
of the page


326
00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.741 line:-1 position:50%
is the new navigation sidebar.


327
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,778 line:-1
I'll move my mouse over
to the CareSchedule item


328
00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:15.548 line:-1 position:50%
and expand it by clicking
on the disclosure triangle.


329
00:15:15.548 --> 00:15:17.283 line:-1 position:50%
Now I can see the pages
that are organized


330
00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.252 line:-1 position:50%
as children of CareSchedule


331
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,687 line:-1
without even needing
to fully open the page.


332
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,156 line:-1
In this case,
I'm interested in


333
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:28,027 line:-1
jumping straight
to the type's initializer.


334
00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:30.429 line:-1 position:50%
I can continue navigating
through the framework,


335
00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:35.168 line:-1 position:50%
expanding other items like
FoodGenerator and SlothFood,


336
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:38,971 line:-1
eventually opening
the twig page.


337
00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:40.873 line:-1 position:50%
As I'm navigating between pages,


338
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,910 line:-1
the state of the navigation
sidebar stays constant,


339
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.246 line:-1 position:50%
allowing me to keep track of
the pages I've already visited.


340
00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:49.615 line:-1 position:50%
This allows for a natural
exploration of the framework


341
00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:52.018 line:-1 position:50%
that I really appreciate.


342
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,654 line:-1
But what if I'm already familiar
with the SlothCreator framework


343
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,757 line:-1
and am looking for information
about a specific symbol?


344
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,626 line:-1
The filter field at the bottom
of the new navigation sidebar


345
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,195 line:-1
is perfect for this.


346
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,463 line:-1
I'm interested in an API
that will help me


347
00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:07.300 line:-1 position:50%
increase the energy level
of my sloths.


348
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.303 line:-1 position:50%
I'll move my mouse to the bottom
of the navigator,


349
00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:15.474 line:-1 position:50%
select the filter bar,
and insert "energy."


350
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475 line:-1
Perfect!


351
00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:19.111 line:-1 position:50%
This documentation
on the energyLevel property


352
00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:21.881 line:-1 position:50%
is exactly what
I was looking for.


353
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,149 line:-1
The new browsing experience


354
00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.785 line:-1 position:50%
offered by Swift-DocC
in Xcode 14


355
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,520 line:-1
is going to bring
your documentation site


356
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,021 line:-1
to the next level.


357
00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:31.958 line:-1 position:50%
We're so excited
for you to try it out.


358
00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.827 line:-1 position:50%
Swift-DocC's integration
in Xcode now offers support


359
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,597 line:-1
for documenting
all of your projects.


360
00:16:37.597 --> 00:16:40.466 line:-1 position:50%
This includes your
Objective-C and Swift code


361
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,602 line:-1
in application
and framework targets,


362
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:47,540 line:-1
whether packaged as Xcode
projects or Swift Packages.


363
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.775 line:-1 position:50%
The DocC archive
produced by Xcode 14


364
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,012 line:-1
is immediately compatible
with popular hosting services,


365
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,947 line:-1
including GitHub Pages.


366
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,750 line:-1
This is a game changer for
distributing your documentation


367
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,152 line:-1
to an even wider audience.


368
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,221 line:-1
And finally, Swift-DocC offers


369
00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:05.625 line:-1 position:50%
a powerful new navigation
experience on the web.


370
00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:08.427 line:-1 position:50%
The navigation sidebar
is going to unlock new ways


371
00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:13.466 line:-1 position:50%
of exploring and finding
the documentation on your site.


372
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,269 position:50%
To learn more about
the new Swift-DocC sidebar


373
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,437 position:50%
and how to best author
your documentation


374
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,806 line:0
to take advantage
of its new features,


375
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,109 line:0
check out the

376
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,145 line:0
of your Swift-DocC content"
session.


377
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,848 line:0
And to take your documentation
even further,


378
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:32,451 line:0
check out the "Build interactive
tutorials using DocC" session

00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,388 position:50%
to learn how to build
step-by-step walk-throughs


380
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,191 line:0
to guide developers
through your app or framework.


381
00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:41.560 line:-1 position:50%
We are so excited to see
all of the documentation


382
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,764 line:-1
you write and publish
with Xcode 14.


383
00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:46.165 line:-1 position:50%
