Hello. My name is Jaewoo.


4
00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:13.213 line:-1 align:center
I'm a designer on the Apple Design team.


5
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,116 line:-2
Whether preparing Keynote presentations
with colleagues


6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,485 line:-1
or collecting ideas with friends,


7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,289 line:-2
people collaborate
on all types of things everyday.


8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,092 line:-2
To create a first-class
collaboration experience,


9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:29,530 line:-2
we made a handful of changes
to iOS 16 and macOS Ventura.


10
00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:32.266 line:-2 align:center
Today, I'm going to talk about
why we put Messages


11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,235 line:-2
in the center of our
collaboration experience


12
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,771 line:-2
and walk you through an end-to-end
collaboration flow,


13
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,974 line:-1
showcasing all the new changes we've made.


14
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,443 line:-1
I'll also share a few considerations


15
00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:46.246 line:-2 align:center
to help you design a great
collaboration experience in your app


16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,048 line:-1
using Messages.


17
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.318 line:-1 align:center
Without further ado, let's get started.


18
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:55,556 line:-2
Email is one of the great communication
tools that people use every day.


19
00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.294 line:-2 align:center
Many collaborative apps use email
as a primary way of connecting people.


20
00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:05.566 line:-2 align:center
However, chatting over email during
collaboration doesn't feel responsive.


21
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,037 line:-2
That's because email was designed
as an asynchronous communication tool.


22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,274 line:-2
So, we brought Messages
into collaboration to supplement email.


23
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,377 line:-2
Messages allows people
to send collaboration invitations


24
00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.780 line:-1 align:center
using existing conversations.


25
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,016 line:-1
No need to ask for email addresses.


26
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.887 line:-2 align:center
Effective communication is a key
to successful collaboration.


27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,491 line:-2
Messages already has many
great features to facilitate that.


28
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:36,363 line:-2
Messages conversations can
also easily turn into FaceTime calls.


29
00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:40.267 line:-2 align:center
Talking over FaceTime and using
screen sharing can make collaboration


30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,002 line:-1
far more productive.


31
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:46,073 line:-2
Let's take a look at how Messages
and collaborative apps work together.


32
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,941 line:-1
My friends and I love baking,


33
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:51,278 line:-2
and we often share recipes
with each other.


34
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:54.214 line:-2 align:center
I'm working on a Pages document
with some recipes,


35
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,451 line:-1
and I'd like to share it with my friends.


36
00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:01.154 line:-2 align:center
I'll start by tapping
on the share button in the toolbar.


37
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:04,324 line:-2
The new system share popover allows me
to share this document


38
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,927 line:-1
in two different ways.


39
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.598 line:-2 align:center
I can either start a new collaboration
or send a copy.


40
00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:15.636 line:-2 align:center
With the collaboration option,
I can send invitations using Messages,


41
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,939 line:-1
Mail, or other communication apps.


42
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,010 line:-2
My baking friends and I have
a chat group called Cupcake Designers.


43
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:26,914 line:-2
The system share popover knows
I talk to them quite often


44
00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:30.317 line:-2 align:center
and show them as a conversation suggestion
in here.


45
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.487 line:-2 align:center
I'll select the group
to start a collaboration.


46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,790 line:-2
The collaboration invitation is
now in the Messages input field


47
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,259 line:-1
and is ready to be sent.


48
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,329 line:-2
Send button kicks off
collaboration immediately.


49
00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:46.800 line:-2 align:center
If you look at the toolbar, you can see
the Cupcake Designers photo appeared.


50
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,771 line:-2
The conversation is now linked
with this document.


51
00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:54.107 line:-2 align:center
Looks like my friends
Lauren and Chris just joined.


52
00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:59.880 line:-2 align:center
Tapping on the group conversation photo
brings up the collaboration popover.


53
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:04,885 line:-2
This collaboration popover was added
for easy access to communication tools


54
00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:08.255 line:-2 align:center
and is also
a quick collaboration overview.


55
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,592 line:-2
Pages displays
who's currently in the document.


56
00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.261 line:-2 align:center
Tapping on the Messages button
in the popover


57
00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:18.365 line:-2 align:center
brings the Messages conversation
over the shared document.


58
00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:21.034 line:-2 align:center
I can quickly go back
to the group conversation


59
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,504 line:-1
and talk about this document.


60
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,306 line:-1
If I need to talk to people over FaceTime,


61
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,043 line:-2
I can simply tap on the audio
or video button in this popover.


62
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,115 line:-2
Now, my friends and I can
make edits in real-time.


63
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,852 line:-2
Tight integration with Messages
unlocks more superpowers.


64
00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:42.589 line:-2 align:center
Now Messages can display notifications
from collaborative apps.


65
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.461 line:-2 align:center
Looks like Chris just made edits
to the Baking Recipes document.


66
00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:53.300 line:-2 align:center
This Messages banner allows me to directly
open the document and see the new updates.


67
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,337 line:-2
Collaborative apps and Messages
now have a strong connection


68
00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:00.874 line:-2 align:center
to make collaboration workflows
more streamlined.


69
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:05,078 line:-2
Okay, we looked at an example
of the new collaboration experience.


70
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,915 line:-2
Starting a collaboration is simple
using the share button


71
00:04:07.948 --> 00:04:10.517 line:-1 align:center
and the system share popover.


72
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:14,655 line:-2
People can easily drop invitations
in existing conversations.


73
00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:17.691 line:-2 align:center
And the collaboration popover
allows people to easily go back


74
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,562 line:-2
to Messages conversations
or start FaceTime calls.


75
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,967 line:-2
Edit notifications from collaborative apps
let people stay up-to-date.


76
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,005 line:-2
Now that we've seen how Messages
and collaborative apps work together,


77
00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.775 line:-2 align:center
let's switch gears
and look at some practical tips


78
00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:38.912 line:-2 align:center
for how to design collaboration
into your app.


79
00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:41.949 line:-1 align:center
Starting with the system share sheet.


80
00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:46.486 line:-2 align:center
The people who use your app are
very familiar with the system share sheet.


81
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,458 line:-2
They use it for all kinds of things,
including sharing websites,


82
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:56.296 line:-2 align:center
songs and albums, photos,
and other types of content.


83
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.966 line:-1 align:center
And conversation suggestions help people


84
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,769 line:-2
quickly find destinations
of the content they are sharing.


85
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:07,407 line:-2
The system share sheet gives people
an easy way to begin a collaboration.


86
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:12,346 line:-2
It will help make collaboration
in your app more consistent and familiar.


87
00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.716 line:-2 align:center
If you do decide to take advantage
of the system share sheet,


88
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:19.887 line:-2 align:center
the next step is to place
a share button in your app.


89
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,190 line:-2
Put the button in a place
where people can easily access.


90
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,326 line:-1
Toolbars are a good candidate.


91
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.296 line:-2 align:center
Now let's look more closely
at how you can customize


92
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.533 line:-1 align:center
the share sheet for your needs.


93
00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:37.237 line:-2 align:center
The popup button in the header allows
people to choose how they share files.


94
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:40,007 line:-2
If your app
doesn't support sending a copy,


95
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.743 line:-1 align:center
then the popup button will be hidden.


96
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,646 line:-2
"Everyone can make changes"
text below the popup button


97
00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.383 line:-2 align:center
is an entry point
to the collaboration permission settings.


98
00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:54.288 line:-2 align:center
You need to provide a descriptive copy
of default settings your app supports.


99
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:58,926 line:-2
To avoid truncation,
be as concise as possible.


100
00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:01.261 line:-2 align:center
The permission settings screen
will be presented


101
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,464 line:-2
when tapping on
"Everyone can make changes" text.


102
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:08,368 line:-2
When customizing the screen,
keep the structure of choices simple


103
00:06:08.402 --> 00:06:13.106 line:-2 align:center
so people can easily skim the options
and make quick decisions.


104
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,443 line:-2
The share popover
in macOS has been redesigned


105
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:22,282 line:-2
to reflect the changes in iOS and iPadOS,
including the conversation suggestions.


106
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:27,054 line:-2
The dropdown menu lets people choose
how they wish to share their files.


107
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,357 line:-2
Permission settings are also
accessible within this popover.


108
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.993 line:-2 align:center
Again, use a concise
permission summary string


109
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,429 line:-1
and keep the settings simple.


110
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,932 line:-2
Next, let's talk about
how to optimize the experience


111
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,935 line:-1
of initiating collaboration in Messages.


112
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,404 line:-1
People can choose not only how they share,


113
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:48,675 line:-2
but also customize collaboration settings
from the Messages input field.


114
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:53,247 line:-2
People don't need to go back to
the share sheet to change those options.


115
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,084 line:-2
Using drag and drop to add a file
into a Messages conversation


116
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,654 line:-2
is another convenient way
of starting a collaboration.


117
00:07:00.687 --> 00:07:04.658 line:-2 align:center
So help people easily set the permissions
from the Messages input field


118
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:07.895 line:-2 align:center
and let them start a collaboration
with the send button.


119
00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:11.164 line:-2 align:center
And it's really important
to put the collaboration button


120
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,467 line:-1
where people can easily find it.


121
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.569 line:-1 align:center
Once people have begun collaborating,


122
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,273 line:-2
the collaboration button
will appear in your app.


123
00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:22.643 line:-2 align:center
This collaboration button is one
of the most important UI elements


124
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,179 line:-1
of the entire collaboration experience.


125
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:29,850 line:-2
Find a place where it can stand out
and draw people's attention.


126
00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:33.987 line:-2 align:center
It's best to place the collaboration
button right next to the share button.


127
00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:36.857 line:-2 align:center
The appearance of the collaboration
button will be slightly different


128
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,460 line:-2
depending on
how people started collaboration.


129
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,931 line:-2
If people sent an invitation
to a one-on-one Messages conversation,


130
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,667 line:-2
the recipient's picture
will appear as the button.


131
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.436 line:-2 align:center
If collaboration started
with a group conversation,


132
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.338 line:-1 align:center
and the conversation has a photo,


133
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:53.874 line:-2 align:center
the system will show
the photo in your app.


134
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,577 line:-2
If a group conversation photo
is not available,


135
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,314 line:-2
a system provided symbol
will be used instead.


136
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,016 line:-2
Once you decide where to put
the collaboration button,


137
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.087 line:-2 align:center
it's time to customize
the collaboration popover for your app.


138
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,291 line:-2
The collaboration popover
consists of three separate sections.


139
00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:14.595 line:-2 align:center
The top section shows
who you are collaborating with.


140
00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:18.799 line:-2 align:center
The system will find corresponding
profile pictures from the Contacts app


141
00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:21.201 line:-1 align:center
and display them here.


142
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:23,904 line:-1
There are also buttons for communication.


143
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:27,474 line:-2
If there is no Messages conversation
linked with the document,


144
00:08:27.508 --> 00:08:30.344 line:-2 align:center
the message button
will let you connect one.


145
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:34,181 line:-2
The middle section is for you,
and it's fully customizable.


146
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,417 line:-2
Think about what information
or functions will be essential


147
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:39.620 line:-1 align:center
for people using your app.


148
00:08:39.653 --> 00:08:43.590 line:-2 align:center
Pages shows the active participant list
with a display setting.


149
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:47,828 line:-2
In contrast,
the Notes app shows the latest activities


150
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,730 line:-1
along with two action buttons.


151
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,199 line:-2
Try not to overload
this collaboration popover


152
00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:54.902 line:-2 align:center
with too much information
or too many buttons.


153
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,004 line:-1
Keep it glanceable.


154
00:08:57.037 --> 00:09:00.574 line:-2 align:center
Also make sure everything
you are adding here is visually consistent


155
00:09:00.607 --> 00:09:03.143 line:-1 align:center
with other elements in the popover.


156
00:09:03.177 --> 00:09:06.380 line:-2 align:center
If your app doesn't have
anything to show in this popover,


157
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,715 line:-2
it's okay to leave

You can customize

and also change other settings
from this screen.


164
00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:30.737 line:-1 align:center
If your app is using CloudKit sharing,


165

the management screen will be
provided by the system.


166
00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:36.076 line:-1 align:center
If you're not using CloudKit sharing,


167
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,213 line:-2
you can have your own
management screen for your app.


168
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:45,018 line:-2
The collaboration popover on macOS
has the same structure as iOS.


169
00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:48.255 line:-2 align:center
Use macOS UI components
and design patterns


170
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,158 line:-1
when customizing the middle section.


171
00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:54.027 line:-2 align:center
Lastly, you will want to give
special consideration


172
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:57.397 line:-2 align:center
to the appearance of the banners
in Messages.


173
00:09:57.431 --> 00:10:01.134 line:-2 align:center
The banners in Messages are
how your app can notify collaborators


174
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,437 line:-1
of important changes.


175
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.508 line:-2 align:center
These banners allow people
to stay informed about new updates


176
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:09.843 line:-1 align:center
without having to open the document.


177
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:14,081 line:-2
Messages offers banner templates
for you to choose from.


178
00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:18.218 line:-2 align:center
Edits made, comments added,
you were mentioned,


179
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:21,121 line:-1
and also files modified.


180
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:24,157 line:-2
Tell Messages what type of updates
you want to display.


181
00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:28.095 line:-2 align:center
Those updates will end up
in the right conversations.


182
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,697 line:-2
You might ask,
what if multiple people made


183
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,767 line:-2
multiple edits
in many different documents?


184
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,870 line:-1
How will Messages handle multiple banners?


185
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:39,973 line:-2
To not clutter conversation
with too many banners,


186
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:43,544 line:-2
Messages will consolidate
those banners into one.


187
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:46,980 line:-2
When people tap
on the view button in this banner,


188
00:10:47.014 --> 00:10:50.083 line:-2 align:center
Messages will show all the updates
in one place


189
00:10:50.117 --> 00:10:53.153 line:-2 align:center
and let people choose
which one they want to open.


190
00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:55.822 line:-2 align:center
Okay, we've taken a look
at all the details


191
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:59,293 line:-2
to design the best collaboration
experience using Messages.


192
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:03,463 line:-2
Adopt the new system share sheet
for better collaboration initiation,


193
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,732 line:-1
and customize the collaboration popover


194
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:10,204 line:-2
to provide communication tools
and a good collaboration overview.


195
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:13,340 line:-2
Let people enjoy a productive
and successful collaboration


196
