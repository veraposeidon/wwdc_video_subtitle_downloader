Hello. My name is Knott.
I'm from Game Center Engineering.


4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,387 line:-2
Today, I'm going to walk you
through improvements we're making


5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,656 line:-1
in Game Center this year.


6
00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.260 line:-2 align:center
Game Center is
Apple's social gaming platform.


7
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:30,931 line:-2
With Game Center, players set up
a profile and connect with friends.


8
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:36,003 line:-2
Using GameKit,
you can easily integrate with Game Center.


9
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,307 line:-2
Players will be automatically signed in,
can compare scores with their friends


10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,512 line:-2
and other players on leaderboards, and
can track progress through achievements.


11
00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:49.716 line:-2 align:center
You can also integrate support for
multiplayer matchmaking and realtime play.


12
00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:54.488 line:-2 align:center
Over the past couple of years,
we've introduced the Access Point,


13
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:58,425 line:-2
redesigned the achievements
and leaderboards experiences —


14
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:04,031 line:-2
introduced the friends API,
and improved the multiplayer experience.


15
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,168 line:-2
Additionally, we've been bringing
Game Center activity to more places


16
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,839 line:-2
across the device including surfacing
what you and friends are playing


17
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,640 line:-1
in the App Store,


18
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:17,477 line:-2
and creating new widgets like
Continue Playing and Friends are Playing.


19
00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:21.748 line:-2 align:center
This year,
we're going even further to make


20
00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:25.719 line:-2 align:center
the experience better for all players,
provide more exposure


21
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,755 line:-2
for all of the great things
happening in your games,


22
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:33,961 line:-2
and give you some new tools
to integrate more easily with Game Center.


23
00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:37.297 line:-2 align:center
I'll walk you through Activity
which brings together


24
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:41,435 line:-2
all of the Game Center events
from your games into one place.


25
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:45,672 line:-2
But before we get to that,
I have an announcement to make.


26
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:50,010 line:-2
We know a lot of game developers
are leveraging Unity


27
00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.747 line:-2 align:center
to help build gaming experiences
on Apple platforms.


28
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.884 line:-2 align:center
This year,
we are releasing a Unity plug-in


29
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,220 line:-1
we've developed specifically for GameKit!


30
00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:06.293 line:-2 align:center
The plug-in provides
an entire GameKit API in C#.


31
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,330 line:-2
So, you don't have to choose
between building your game with Unity,


32
00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:14.902 line:-2 align:center
and taking full advantage of the first
class gaming features in Game Center.


33
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.406 line:-2 align:center
Throughout this session,
you'll see code examples


34
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,210 line:-2
provided not only in Swift,
but also in C#.


35
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:27,948 line:-2
Now, let's dive right into one
of the biggest changes to Game Center


36
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.417 line:-1 align:center
this year: Activity.


37
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,654 line:-2
There are so many exciting
things happening in your games


38
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,924 line:-2
that friends might want to
tell each other about.


39
00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:42.029 line:-2 align:center
For example, when they get a
new achievement, or jump up a leaderboard.


40
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:47,067 line:-2
We've redesigned the Game Center dashboard
this year so that it will now include


41
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.505 line:-2 align:center
activity from a player's friends in your
game and across games, all in one place.


42
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:57,511 line:-2
When a player opens the dashboard,
they will see recent activity in your game


43
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:02,583 line:-2
like achievements earned, when friends
have made huge jumps on the leaderboard,


44
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:06,353 line:-2
or when one friend has beaten
another player's high score.


45
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:12,559 line:-2
And, of course we are designing this
to work on iPad, Mac and Apple TV as well.


46
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,896 line:-2
I am really excited about what this means
for players to see


47
00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.899 line:-2 align:center
and engage more
with what their friends are doing,


48
00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:22.202 line:-2 align:center
and to have your game and all of
the great activity from your game


49
00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:24.137 line:-1 align:center
discovered in more places.


50
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:29,409 line:-2
If you are already using Game Center for
your games, you don't have to do anything!


51
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:33,046 line:-2
Your games
will already appear in Activity.


52
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,617 line:-2
But if not,
it's really easy to get started.


53
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.053 line:-2 align:center
All you need to do is enable
the Game Center capability


54
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:45,392 line:-2
and write just a few lines of code
to make sure authentication goes smoothly.


55
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,128 line:-1
First, go to your game's Xcode project,


56
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:51.798 line:-2 align:center
then head over
to the Signing and Capabilities tab.


57
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:56,837 line:-2
Click on the add capability button,
then select Game Center.


58
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,573 line:-2
Then, go to your app record
in App Store Connect


59
00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:02.676 line:-2 align:center
in order to enable Game Center
for your game.


60
00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.847 line:-2 align:center
This is also the place where you
can configure Game Center features,


61
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,017 line:-1
such as leaderboards and achievements.


62
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,655 line:-2
And finally, import GameKit,
then authenticate the local player


63
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,424 line:-1
by setting the authenticateHandler.


64
00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:21.495 line:-2 align:center
You'll want to place this code
as early as possible in your game,


65
00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:23.564 line:-1 align:center
even on the title screen.


66
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,034 line:-2
Then, if there is a view controller
available from the callback,


67
00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.102 line:-1 align:center
present it here.


68
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:34,074 line:-2
For Unity developers,
just call "authenticate" on GKLocalPlayer.


69
00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:39.046 line:-2 align:center
This static method returns the
local player object once authenticated.


70
00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:43.584 line:-2 align:center
Congratulations! Your game
is now Game Center enabled.


71
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,954 line:-2
Players will see this welcome banner
when they launch your game,


72
00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:52.092 line:-2 align:center
and gameplay activity for your game will
start appearing in the players' feeds.


73
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:58,332 line:-2
Now, all that's left is for you to provide
players easy access to the Dashboard.


74
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:02,402 line:-2
The best way to do so is through
the Game Center Access Point.


75
00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:06.273 line:-2 align:center
Access Point provides your players
a convenient way to launch


76
00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.542 line:-1 align:center
the Game Center dashboard.


77
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:12,713 line:-2
Let's jump back to some code.
Showing the access point is easy.


78
00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:16.717 line:-2 align:center
First, you'll want to decide on
the most appropriate time to display it.


79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,220 line:-2
You should consider what makes
the most sense for your game,


80
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:24,658 line:-2
but for many games, the ideal presentation
occurs on the game menu page.


81
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.561 line:-2 align:center
Once you've determined that,
all you need to do


82
00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:30.030 line:-1 align:center
is set a location for its appearance,


83
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:35,235 line:-2
and then set the GKAccessPoint's
'isActive' property to 'true.'


84
00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:39.573 line:-2 align:center
As a result, the Access Point
will show up in your game.


85
00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:43.877 line:-2 align:center
And here is how Unity developers
can use GKAccessPoint in C#.


86
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:48,549 line:-2
Set the Access Point's location
and set IsActive to true.


87
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,351 line:-2
When players interact
with the Access Point,


88
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,954 line:-1
the system brings up the Dashboard.


89
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:58,091 line:-2
This provides a familiar place for
players to learn more about your game


90
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,994 line:-1
as well as check in on recent activity.


91
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:05,032 line:-2
Players can explore your game's
own achievements and leaderboards.


92
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:10,470 line:-2
Next, players will see gameplay events
for your game, featured first in the feed.


93
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:14,708 line:-2
Here, Cloeax,
Jeezzzy and I are playing The Coast.


94
00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:16.543 line:-1 align:center
With just those few lines of code,


95
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,713 line:-2
your game will get increased reach
and distribution


96
00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:24.451 line:-2 align:center
while tying in to the broader gaming
experience on Apple platforms.


97
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:29,056 line:-2
There are a lot of things you can add
in your game that will generate Activity.


98
00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:30.924 line:-1 align:center
Let's start with Leaderboards.


99
00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:35.896 line:-2 align:center
Leaderboards are a powerful way to
increase your game's exposure in Activity.


100
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,998 line:-1
They encourage friendly competition,


101
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,969 line:-2
giving players more reasons
to jump back into your game.


102
00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:44.371 line:-2 align:center
After you have set up
a leaderboard in your game,


103
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,876 line:-2
players will see new activity when their
friends are doing well on a leaderboard.


104
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,614 line:-2
Here, my friend placed
in the top 25% of a leaderboard.


105
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:58,385 line:-2
Activity also highlights when a player's
friend beats their leaderboard score.


106
00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.989 line:-2 align:center
Here, Simundane just beat my score
in a game we've been competing on


107
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,957 line:-1
back and forth.


108
00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:07.794 line:-2 align:center
For this activity,
players will also get a notification.


109
00:07:07.828 --> 00:07:10.831 line:-2 align:center
This notification is sent from
Game Center,


110
00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:12.900 line:-1 align:center
and you don't need to worry about


111
00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:16.970 line:-2 align:center
asking the user to opt in
to notifications for your game.


112
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,073 line:-2
If your game
already provides leaderboards,


113
00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:23.544 line:-2 align:center
these activities
will appear automatically.


114
00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:26.680 line:-2 align:center
Even if you're already taking
advantage of leaderboards,


115
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,416 line:-1
consider expanding your leaderboard sets


116
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,554 line:-2
to provide more moments of competition
for players and their friends.


117
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:38,158 line:-2
Recurring leaderboards in particular
provide a sense of timeliness


118
00:07:38.192 --> 00:07:42.196 line:-2 align:center
and a reason to re-engage
with your game on an ongoing basis.


119
00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:45.666 line:-2 align:center
Next, I'd like to talk about
how Game Center Achievements


120
00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:48.068 line:-1 align:center
are featured in Activity.


121
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:52,372 line:-2
Achievements provide players an
additional way of engaging with your game,


122
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:56,944 line:-2
tracking gameplay progress,
and sharing that progress with friends.


123
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,047 line:-2
When a player completes
an achievement in your game,


124
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,918 line:-2
this will be reflected in their activity
and their friends' activity as well.


125
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,754 align:center
When a player completes
every achievement in your game,


126
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:13,327 line:0
we take a moment to recognize that
with a special celebratory activity.


127
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,364 line:0
Achievements provide players with
a sense of progress and accomplishment,


128
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:22,369 line:0
and can help tell a story of how far
a player has made it through your game.


129
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:27,207 line:-2
With prominent placement in Activity,
achievements instantly receive


130
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:31,144 line:-2
wider visibility throughout
the Game Center social network.


131
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,881 align:center
Players can see
how their friends are doing,


132
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:38,185 align:center
and they'll have more reasons to
jump into your game and play together.


133
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:42,189 line:-2
You just saw what players will see
when they land on your game's Dashboard.


134
00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:44.558 line:-1 align:center
Players can also visit a friend's profile


135
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,794 line:-2
to see all of their
recent activity in one place.


136
00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:50.964 line:-2 align:center
And of course, what you see or don't see
on someone's profile


137
00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:53.400 line:-2 align:center
is still based on
the profile privacy option


138
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,636 line:-1
they choose in Game Center settings.


139
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:59,506 line:-2
And that is Activity: a place
where players can discover


140
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,808 line:-1
their friends' activity in your game,


141
00:09:01.842 --> 00:09:05.546 line:-2 align:center
as well as check in
on their friends' activity across games.


142
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:09,883 line:-2
In summary, Game Center
is helping you help your players


143
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:13,720 line:-2
have more fun playing with
and competing against their friends.


144
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:18,825 line:-2
Activity is a great destination for
players to check in on their progress


145
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:23,564 line:-2
as well as their friends' progress
and provide you more distribution.


146
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:28,268 line:-2
And for Unity developers,
it is now possible to take advantage


147
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:33,106 line:-2
of the full extent of GameKit
with our brand new Unity plug-in.


148
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,044 align:center
You can learn more about how to bring
the best out of Game Center features


149
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,180 line:0
from your game,
how to use recurring leaderboards,


150
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:42,616 line:0
and how to use GameKit
in your Unity games


151
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,485 align:center
in the sessions linked to this video.


152
00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:48.322 line:-1 align:center
I have covered a lot today.


153
00:09:48.355 --> 00:09:53.126 line:-2 align:center
And we trust that this year's updates will
