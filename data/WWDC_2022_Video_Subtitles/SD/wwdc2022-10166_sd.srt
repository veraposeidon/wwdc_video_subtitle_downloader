Hi, I'm Julia
from Privacy Engineering,


5
00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.516 line:-1 position:50%
and welcome to "Explore
App Tracking Transparency."


6
00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:20.787 line:-1 position:50%
At Apple, we believe privacy
is a fundamental human right.


7
00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.823 line:-1 position:50%
Part of engineering
great privacy


8
00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:25.259 line:-1 position:50%
is giving people
choices and control


9
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,427 line:-1
over how their data is used.


10
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,929 line:-1
When people have these choices


11
00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.165 line:-1 position:50%
and understand how their data
will be linked or shared,


12
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:36,803 line:-1
they are more likely to trust
and engage with your app.


13
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,705 position:50%
That's why,
beginning last year,


14
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,809 position:50%
App Store policy requires apps
to receive users' permission


15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,779 line:1
before tracking users
across apps and websites


16
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,115 line:1
owned by other companies
by adopting


17
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:51,551 line:1
the AppTrackingTransparency
framework.


18
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,554 line:-1
Today, I'm going to talk to you
about when and how to adopt


19
00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.090 line:-1 position:50%
App Tracking Transparency.


20
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.526 line:-1 position:50%
First, I'll start with some
background on tracking


21
00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.496 line:-1 position:50%
to help you understand if
and when your app needs to adopt


22
00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:05.866 line:-1 position:50%
the AppTrackingTransparency
framework.


23
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.335 line:-1 position:50%
Then, I'll highlight some
key things to keep in mind


24
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,338 line:-1
when adopting the framework
in practice.


25
00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:14.441 line:-1 position:50%
Let's get started with some
background on tracking.


26
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,512 line:-1
So, how is tracking defined
for App Tracking Transparency?


27
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,815 line:-1
Tracking refers to linking
user or device data


28
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.718 line:-1 position:50%
collected from your app
with user or device data


29
00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:27.421 line:-1 position:50%
collected from other
companies' apps, websites,


30
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,990 line:-1
or offline properties
for targeted advertising


31
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,993 line:-1
or advertising-measurement
purposes.


32
00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:35.996 line:-1 position:50%
Tracking also refers
to sharing user or device data


33
00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:39.132 line:-1 position:50%
with data brokers.


34
00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.001 line:-1 position:50%
Let's talk through
some example scenarios


35
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:44.271 line:-1 position:50%
to better understand
how tracking is defined.


36
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:46.540 line:-1 position:50%
First, let's look
at an advertising scenario


37
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,910 line:-1
that doesn't involve tracking.


38
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.646 line:-1 position:50%
Suppose I download
an app called Pal About,


39
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,881 line:-1
and the Pal About app
has a feature


40
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,150 line:-1
that lets me search
for places and events


41
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.152 line:-1 position:50%
that are happening nearby.


42
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,022 line:1
Now suppose I use Pal About
to search for places


43
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:05,225 position:50%
that serve waffles near me,
which results in Pal About


44
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,228 position:50%
storing waffles
as an interest of mine.


45
00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:11.531 line:-1 position:50%
Pal About later wants to show
an ad for breakfast places


46
00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:14.534 line:-1 position:50%
targeting people
who like breakfast foods.


47
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,971 line:-1
Using the data Pal About stores
about me from my searches,


48
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,041 line:-1
Pal About shows me
the breakfast ad.


49
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,378 position:50%
In this example,
Pal About doesn't link my data


50
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,446 position:50%
with any data
from an app or website


51
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,549 position:50%
owned by another company
to show me the breakfast ad,


52
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:34,354 line:1
so this scenario would
not be considered tracking.


53
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,524 line:-1
For another example that
wouldn't be considered tracking,


54
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,961 line:-1
suppose the company that owns
Pal About -- Pal About Inc. --


55
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,398 line:-1
has another app that I use
called Pal About Plus.


56
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:48,101 line:-1
And Pal About's server links
together data collected about me


57
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,471 line:-1
in Pal About Plus,
like my interest in tacos,


58
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:55,008 line:-1
with data collected about me
in Pal About.


59
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,545 position:50%
After linking this data,
Pal About shows me an ad


60
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,882 position:50%
for a taco truck using
the fact I like tacos


61
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,484 position:50%
collected from Pal About Plus.


62
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,220 position:50%
In this example,
the Pal About app doesn't need


63
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,690 position:50%
to get my permission to track
because it isn't tracking.


64
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,460 position:50%
Pal About doesn't link
my data from Pal About


65
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,495 position:50%
with any data
from an app or website


66
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,831 position:50%
owned by another company.


67
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.934 line:-1 position:50%
Let's now consider a scenario
that would require Pal About


68
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,170 line:-1
to get permission to track.


69
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.238 line:-1 position:50%
Suppose there's
a food delivery app I use


70
00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:28.809 line:-1 position:50%
that's owned by a different
company than Pal About.


71
00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.343 line:-1 position:50%
And I've used
the food delivery app


72
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,646 line:-1
to place orders late at night.


73
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,681 line:-1
When I signed up for
the food delivery app,


74
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,851 line:-1
I gave the app
my email address --


75
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:41,321 position:50%
the same email address I used
to sign up for Pal About


76
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:45,425 position:50%
and that Pal About stores
for my account.


77
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,527 position:50%
The food delivery app
includes code


78
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,229 position:50%
that shares my email address


79
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,633 line:1
and the fact I often order
at night with Pal About.


80
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:57,237 line:1
The Pal About server uses my
email address to link together


81
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,540 line:1
my interest in waffles,
collected by the Pal About app,


82
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,142 line:1
to the fact I order at night,


83
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:05,345 line:1
collected in
the food delivery app.


84
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,048 line:1
Finally, Pal About
uses the combination


85
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,917 position:50%
of my ordering habits
and my interest in waffles


86
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,552 line:1
to show me
an ad for a restaurant


87
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,322 position:50%
that serves all-day breakfast.


88
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,491 position:50%
This scenario
would require Pal About


89
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,459 position:50%
to request permission to track


90
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,129 line:1
because it linked user data
from Pal About --


91
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,363 line:1
my email address --


92
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,532 position:50%
with another company's
user data --


93
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,868 position:50%
my email and habit
of ordering at night --


94
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,170 position:50%
for advertising purposes.


95
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,473 line:-1
In this example, data is
linked together across apps


96
00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:36.042 line:-1 position:50%
with an email address.


97
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,012 line:1
Even if the email address
or another user identifier


98
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,182 position:50%
is hashed before it is used
to link data,


99
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,318 position:50%
it would still require
permission to track


100
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,421 position:50%
because it would still be
linking data about a user


101
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:52,859 line:1
from the app with another
company's data about that user.


102
00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:56.329 line:-1 position:50%
The type of identifier
and whether or not it is hashed


103
00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:59.432 line:-1 position:50%
doesn't change the fact
it is being used for tracking,


104
00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:03.303 line:-1 position:50%
which is what
requires permission.


105
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,838 line:-1
Another thing
you'll need to consider


106
00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:08.141 line:-1 position:50%
to determine if your app needs
to request permission to track


107
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:12.812 line:-1 position:50%
is how third-party SDKs use
and share data from your app.


108
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,980 line:-1
As a developer,


109
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.417 line:-1 position:50%
you're responsible for
the behavior of your whole app.


110
00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:20.887 line:-1 position:50%
Returning to our example,
suppose the Pal About developer


111
00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:23.056 line:-1 position:50%
hasn't written
any code themselves


112
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,358 line:-1
that would require
permission to track,


113
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,361 line:-1
but would like to include
a third-party SDK in their app


114
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,398 line:-1
for advertising-measurement
purposes.


115
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,867 line:-1
Whether Pal About
needs permission to track


116
00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:37.571 line:-1 position:50%
in order to include the SDK
depends on whether or not


117
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.640 line:-1 position:50%
the SDK combines
user data from Pal About


118
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.145 line:-1 position:50%
with user data from other
companies' apps or websites.


119
00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:49.449 line:-1 position:50%
For example, if the SDK
shares user data from Pal About


120
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,519 line:-1
to provide analytics
about ads in Pal About,


121
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,789 line:-1
but doesn't link the user data
it collects from Pal About


122
00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.991 line:-1 position:50%
with user data
from other companies,


123
00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:02.762 line:-1 position:50%
it doesn't require
permission to track.


124
00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:04.531 line:-1 position:50%
Now suppose instead,


125
00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:09.035 line:-1 position:50%
the SDK shares user data from
Pal About with an ad network,


126
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,072 line:-1
and the ad network
links the data it receives


127
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,974 line:-1
about how I use Pal About


128
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,810 line:-1
with data about ads I saw
in other companies' apps


129
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,547 line:-1
to compare the impact
of ad campaigns in those apps.


130
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,483 line:-1
This requires Pal About
to request users' permission


131
00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:26.920 line:-1 position:50%
to track because this SDK
is tracking.


132
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.123 line:-1 position:50%
This is considered tracking
regardless of whether Pal About


133
00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:32.859 line:-1 position:50%
uses the SDK
for those purposes,


134
00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:36.429 line:-1 position:50%
or even if Pal About
only gets aggregate reporting


135
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,132 line:-1
after Pal About
users' data is linked


136
00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:42.202 line:-1 position:50%
with other companies'
users' data.


137
00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:45.238 line:-1 position:50%
If you're unsure about
whether an SDK you want to use


138
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.906 line:-1 position:50%
would contain code
that would require


139
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,842 line:-1
App Tracking Transparency,


140
00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:52.345 line:-1 position:50%
you should ask the developer
of that SDK.


141
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,382 line:-1
This responsibility applies
not just to SDKs,


142
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:59,519 line:-1
but to any libraries or
third-party code your app uses.


143
00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:03.623 line:-1 position:50%
So far, we've looked at examples
that involve linking user data.


144
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,158 line:-1
Now let's look
at another scenario


145
00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:06.860 line:-1 position:50%
that's considered tracking:


146
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,863 line:-1
sharing user or device data
with data brokers.


147
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,166 line:-1
First, how are data brokers
defined?


148
00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.569 line:-1 position:50%
Data brokers are defined by law
in some jurisdictions.


149
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,539 line:-1
But in general,
a data broker is a company


150
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,575 line:-1
that regularly collects
and sells, licenses,


151
00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:25.111 line:-1 position:50%
or otherwise discloses
to third parties


152
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.981 line:-1 position:50%
the personal information
of particular end users


153
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,451 line:-1
with whom the business does
not have a direct relationship.


154
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,622 line:-1
Let's look at sharing data with
a data broker in an example.


155
00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.858 line:-1 position:50%
Suppose the Pal About app
includes client code


156
00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.794 line:-1 position:50%
that sends my interest
in waffles


157
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:44.097 line:-1 position:50%
and an account identifier
to a data broker.


158
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,132 line:-1
This scenario counts as tracking


159
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,101 line:-1
whether or not
the data that is shared


160
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,370 line:-1
is linked with data
from other companies


161
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,239 line:-1
for advertising
or advertising measurement.


162
00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:55.575 line:-1 position:50%
Sharing of user data
with a data broker


163
00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:59.379 line:-1 position:50%
requires permission to track.


164
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,648 line:-1
And even if
Pal About client code


165
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,250 line:-1
doesn't directly send
my account identifier


166
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,986 line:-1
and my interest in waffles
to the data broker,


167
00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:10.357 line:-1 position:50%
but instead this interest
is sent to Pal About's server


168
00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:12.525 line:-1 position:50%
and the server
later shares accounts


169
00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:15.295 line:-1 position:50%
interested in waffles
with the data broker,


170
00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:17.864 line:-1 position:50%
this would require
getting permission to track


171
00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:20.066 line:-1 position:50%
even though my device
isn't communicating


172
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,836 line:-1
with the data broker directly.


173
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,105 line:-1
We've now talked through
how the definition of tracking


174
00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:27.507 line:-1 position:50%
applies to some
example scenarios.


175
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.477 line:-1 position:50%
For more information about
how App Tracking Transparency


176
00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:32.312 line:-1 position:50%
defines tracking,
you can visit


177
00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:35.448 line:-1 position:50%
the User Privacy
and Data Use page.


178
00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:37.584 line:-1 position:50%
Now, if you've determined
that your app


179
00:08:37.584 --> 00:08:39.352 line:-1 position:50%
would like to track users,


180
00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:42.288 line:-1 position:50%
you'll need to ask for
and obtain the user's permission


181
00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:43.957 line:-1 position:50%
before you do so.


182
00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:45.658 line:-1 position:50%
Here's how.


183
00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:48.762 line:-1 position:50%
To ask for permission
for your app to track,


184
00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:51.598 line:-1 position:50%
you'll need to present
the app tracking authorization


185
00:08:51.598 --> 00:08:53.800 line:-1 position:50%
request prompt by calling


186
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,504 line:-1
the requestTrackingAuthorization
method.


187
00:08:57.504 --> 00:09:00.707 line:-1 position:50%
Calling this method will cause
a system permission alert --


188
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:05,211 line:-1
like this one for Pal About --
to appear over your app.


189
00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.046 line:-1 position:50%
This is a one-time prompt.


190
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,449 line:-1
The system will remember
the user's choice


191
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,650 line:-1
and won't prompt again


192
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.421 line:-1 position:50%
unless the app is uninstalled
and reinstalled.


193
00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:17.123 line:-1 position:50%
The next thing you'll
need to do is provide


194
00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:23.363 line:-1 position:50%
a NSUserTrackingUsageDescription
key in your app's info.plist.


195
00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:26.866 line:-1 position:50%
The string provided here will
be shown in the system prompt


196
00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:30.470 line:-1 position:50%
and informs the user why
the app is requesting permission


197
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.207 line:-1 position:50%
to use data for tracking
the user or the device.


198
00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:37.877 line:-1 position:50%
A great purpose string is clear,
concise, and helps users


199
00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:41.281 line:-1 position:50%
understand why they are
being asked to allow tracking.


200
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,217 line:-1
This string doesn't need
to include the app's name,


201
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,719 line:-1
because the system
will automatically identify


202
00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:49.055 line:-1 position:50%
the requesting app
and display the app name


203
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,391 line:-1
in the system prompt.


204
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:54.327 line:-1 position:50%
If you don't include
a usage-description string,


205
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,864 line:-1
your app will crash
when the system prompt is shown.


206
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:01,634 line:-1
Finally, use
trackingAuthorizationStatus


207
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,404 line:-1
to determine the user's
app-tracking permission status


208
00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:06.639 line:-1 position:50%
for your app.


209
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,242 line:-1
If a user has selected
Allow for this app,


210
00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:11.678 line:-1 position:50%
then you have their permission
to link their activity


211
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,614 line:-1
in that app across
other apps and websites


212
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,250 line:-1
as long as their
tracking authorization status


213
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,652 line:-1
remains authorized.


214
00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:22.021 line:-1 position:50%
Users can change
and grant or revoke


215
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,291 line:-1
their tracking authorization
at any time,


216
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,329 line:-1
so make sure your app checks the
tracking authorization status


217
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,932 line:-1
each time it is launched
and only continues to track


218
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,602 line:-1
when the value of the
tracking authorization status


219
00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:37.804 line:-1 position:50%
is authorized.


220
00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:41.341 line:-1 position:50%
Users can control whether apps
have their permission to track


221
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:43.877 line:-1 position:50%
on a per-app basis.


222
00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:46.312 line:-1 position:50%
Just because a user
has given one of your apps


223
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,282 line:-1
permission to track doesn't mean
you have their permission


224
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,986 line:-1
to track in another app
owned by the same company.


225
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,689 line:-1
Different apps must each
individually request permission


226
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,526 line:-1
from the user
for that particular app


227
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,961 line:-1
before data from
that app can be linked


228
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,097 line:-1
to apps or websites
owned by other companies


229
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:07,634 line:-1
for marketing or advertising.


230
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,102 line:-1
If your app doesn't have


231
00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:11.371 line:-1 position:50%
tracking authorization
for a user,


232
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:14.307 line:-1 position:50%
there are a couple things
to keep in mind.


233
00:11:14.307 --> 00:11:17.210 line:-1 position:50%
First, per the App Store
review guidelines,


234
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.979 line:-1 position:50%
your app must not gate
any of its functionality


235
00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:23.716 line:-1 position:50%
on whether the user agrees
to allow tracking.


236
00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:27.554 line:-1 position:50%
Second, the IDFA API
will return all zeros


237
00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:31.190 line:-1 position:50%
if the user has asked your app
not to track.


238
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,226 line:-1
If a user has opted
out of tracking,


239
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,962 line:-1
there are nontracking
alternatives for advertising


240
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,498 line:-1
or advertising measurement
for your app.


241
00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:42.035 line:-1 position:50%
For example, your app could
choose to serve first-party ads


242
00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.836 line:-1 position:50%
or contextual ads.


243
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,140 line:-1
And for advertising measurement,
we continue to build and improve


244
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,276 line:-1
privacy preserving
ad-attribution technologies


245
00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:52.512 line:-1 position:50%
that ad networks can adopt.


246
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,814 position:50%
For more information
about recent improvements


247
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,718 line:1
to SKAdNetwork and private click
measurement, you can refer to


248
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,287 position:50%
"Meet privacy preserving
ad attribution"


249
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,824 position:50%
and "What's new in SKAdNetwork."


250
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,760 position:50%
You'll also need to declare
what data your app uses


251
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,931 line:1
to track for display in your
app's privacy nutrition label.


252
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,933 position:50%
Filling out your
privacy nutrition label


253
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,202 line:1
when submitting your app
to the App Store


254
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,404 position:50%
and getting permission
to track using


255
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,773 line:1
the AppTrackingTransparency
framework


256
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,443 line:1
are two separate steps
that are both required


257
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,746 line:1
if your app would like to use
data for tracking.


258
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,115 position:50%
For more information
about nutrition labels


259
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,883 line:1
and how to fill them out
for your app,

00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,220 line:1
see "Create your
Privacy Nutrition Label."


261
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,523 line:-1
Finally, let's talk
about fingerprinting.


262
00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:40.560 line:-1 position:50%
With permission,
tracking is allowed.


263
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,496 line:-1
But fingerprinting
is never allowed.


264
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,698 line:-1
Regardless of whether
a user gives your app


265
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,201 line:-1
permission to track,
fingerprinting --


266
00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:49.902 line:-1 position:50%
or using signals
from the device


267
00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:52.405 line:-1 position:50%
to try to identify
the device or user --


268
00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:53.539 line:-1 position:50%
is not allowed


269
00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:57.677 line:-1 position:50%
per the Apple Developer Program
License Agreement.


270
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:01,114 line:-1
Some examples of user or device
data used for fingerprinting


271
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,549 line:-1
include properties
of a user's web browser


272
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,018 line:-1
and its configuration,


273
00:13:05.018 --> 00:13:07.253 line:-1 position:50%
the user's device
and its configuration,


274
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,557 line:-1
the user's location, or
the user's network connection.


275
00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:14.060 line:-1 position:50%
Collecting any data
solely for the purpose


276
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,197 line:-1
of generating a fingerprint
is also not allowed.


277
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,800 line:-1
It's important people
have transparency and control


278
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.870 line:-1 position:50%
over how their data
is used for tracking.


279
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.005 line:-1 position:50%
We hope that by tuning in
to this session,


280
00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.174 line:-1 position:50%
you now have the tools
you need to determine


281
00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:31.277 line:-1 position:50%
when and how to give people
that control by adopting


282
00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:33.713 line:-1 position:50%
the AppTrackingTransparency
framework.


283
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,148 line:-1
Thanks for watching.
