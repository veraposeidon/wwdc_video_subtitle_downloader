Karthik: Hi, I'm Karthik,


4
00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.581 line:-1 align:center
an engineer on the Messages team.


5
00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:18.318 line:-2 align:center
In this video,
I'm going to introduce Shared with You,


6
00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.921 line:-1 align:center
and how to adopt it in your app.


7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,959 line:-1
Shared with You was announced in iOS 15.


8
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:29,830 line:-2
It is designed to make it easier
for you to revisit links


9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,667 line:-2
that friends and family send you
in Messages.


10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,604 line:-2
System applications that have
adopted Shared with You are


11
00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:40.240 line:-1 align:center
Safari, News,


12
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,910 line:-1
Music, Podcasts,


13
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:46,213 line:-1
the TV app and Photos.


14
00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:51.351 line:-2 align:center
Shared with You meets you
where you're consuming content.


15
00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:56.390 line:-2 align:center
Many times content is received
when we are not ready to consume it.


16
00:00:56.423 --> 00:01:01.028 line:-2 align:center
For example, a friend sends
a recommendation for a TV show


17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,630 line:-1
while you are out grocery shopping,


18
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:07,901 line:-2
and then it's forgotten
in the course of the day.


19
00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:12.840 line:-2 align:center
Shared with You makes it easier
to discover this TV show later on


20
00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:17.477 line:-2 align:center
when you are browsing
for TV shows to watch in the TV app


21
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:22.816 line:-2 align:center
Shared with You makes it convenient to
pick up a Messages conversation


22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,252 line:-1
right from within the app,


23
00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:29.456 line:-2 align:center
allowing you to stay in context
of shared content


24
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,792 line:-1
without leaving the app.


25
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,964 line:-1
Your content can be pinned in Messages.


26
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:42,436 line:-2
It elevates the content
in Shared with You and Search.


27
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,405 line:-2
This is a signal
that content is important,


28
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,809 line:-2
and starts the flow
of automatic sharing consent.


29
00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:51.211 line:-1 align:center
More on that later.


30
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:57,618 line:-2
In iOS 16, Shared with You is extended
to include your apps, links, and content.


31
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:01,822 line:-2
This takes the convenience of
Shared with You and puts it in your apps.


32
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,927 line:-2
I'll first talk about the design
of Shared with You in your app,


33
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.997 line:-1 align:center
then show you how it works,


34
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.066 line:-2 align:center
and then walk you through
how to adopt Shared with You.


35
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,203 line:-1
Starting with design.


36
00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:21.208 line:-2 align:center
There are two parts of Shared with You
that are part of your app experience:


37
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:26.013 line:-2 align:center
The Shared with You shelf,
and the Shared with You attribution view.


38
00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:29.516 line:-2 align:center
The Shared with You shelf
is a dedicated space


39
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.386 line:-1 align:center
in your app's browsing experience


40
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:37,090 line:-2
that highlights content
that was shared in Messages.


41
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:44,198 line:-2
For example, the TV app's "Watch Now" tab
has a Shared with You shelf.


42
00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:48.502 line:-2 align:center
So does the Listen Now tab
in Music and Podcasts.


43
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:55,475 line:-2
The content provided by Shared with You
is a ranked and ordered list.


44
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,879 line:-1
I'll go over that later in the video.


45
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,949 line:-2
For each item
in the Shared with You shelf,


46
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:07,087 line:-2
show a rich preview
along with an attribution view.


47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,391 line:-1
A rich preview has thumbnail, a title,


48
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,361 line:-1
and a subtitle if applicable.


49
00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:19.166 line:-2 align:center
In this example, the rich preview
consists of podcast art,


50
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,669 line:-1
episode name, and the show name.


51
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:27,341 line:-2
There is also an attribution view
for each shared content


52
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,610 line:-1
in the Shared with You shelf.


53
00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:32.479 line:-2 align:center
This is the all of the information
that allows context


54
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,681 line:-1
to be gleaned at a glance.


55
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,486 line:-2
Have a Show More element
that can expand the view


56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,024 line:-2
or navigate to showing all of your app's
Shared with You content.


57
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,794 line:-2
The Attribution view
is an out of process view


58
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:54,434 line:-2
that securely displays the names
and avatars of who shared it.


59
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:59,907 line:-2
It also shows
if the content was pinned in Messages.


60
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,012 line:-2
Show the attribution view
in the details view of your content.


61
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:09,216 line:-2
This allows people to connect
content in your app


62
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,886 line:-2
back to the Messages conversation
it was shared in.


63
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,124 line:-2
For example,
when I'm browsing for a TV show to watch,


64
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:23,497 line:-2
the attribution view helps me recall
that a friend had recommend it.


65
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,202 line:-2
I can quickly tell my friend
that I'm about to watch the show.


66
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,872 line:-1
All this happens right in app,


67
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:36,376 line:-2
and after replying,
I'm right back at the content.


68
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,179 line:-1
The attribution view is interactive.


69
00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:42.482 line:-2 align:center
Tapping on the view takes you
to the Messages conversation


70
00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:45.185 line:-1 align:center
right from within the application.


71
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:50,123 line:-2
The attribution view also presents
contextual menu options


72
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,994 line:-1
such as "Reply" and "Remove".


73
00:04:54,027 --> 00:05:00,968 line:-2
The "Reply" content menu option
functions similar to tapping the view.


74
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,638 line:-2
The "Remove" context menu option
is a way to tell the Shared with You


75
00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:08.509 line:-2 align:center
not to surface a piece of content
going forward.


76
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:12,346 line:-2
The same contextual menus
are made available to you


77
00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.717 line:-1 align:center
to add to your content's contextual menus.


78
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,488 line:-2
The title for the Remove context menu
can be customized.


79
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,358 line:-1
For example in Safari,


80
00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:29.396 line:-2 align:center
the contextual menu
for the web page shows "Remove Link".


81
00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:35.269 line:-2 align:center
I'll go over how you can do this
in your app later on in this video.


82
00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:38.872 line:-2 align:center
Now you know where to present
a Shared with You shelf


83
00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:42.242 line:-1 align:center
and where to show the Attribution View.


84
00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:45.045 line:-1 align:center
Let me show you how Shared with You works.


85
00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:52.386 line:-2 align:center
Links shared by friends and family in
Messages are surfaced in Shared with You.


86
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,589 line:-1
Links in group conversations are surfaced


87
00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:59.826 line:-2 align:center
when at least one participant
is a contact.


88
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,332 line:-2
Shared with You is based on the same
technology behind Universal Links.


89
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:11,505 line:-2
Universal Links allows for
seamless linking to content in your app


90
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,208 line:-1
or on your website.


91
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:19.346 line:-2 align:center
Users have granular control
over Shared with You content.


92
00:06:20.414 --> 00:06:25.118 line:-2 align:center
They can choose what content is shared
outside of Messages


93
00:06:25.152 --> 00:06:27.988 line:-1 align:center
on a per conversation basis,


94
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:31,124 line:-1
per app, or globally.


95
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:36,396 line:-2
This permission doesn't need
to be requested in advance.


96
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.399 line:-1 align:center
It happens organically.


97
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:46,340 line:-2
Pinning links is implicit permission
to surface the content in Shared with You.


98
00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:52.012 line:-2 align:center
Pinned content is always available
to Shared with You in your app.


99
00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:57.951 line:-2 align:center
Based on heuristics when content
for your app is pinned in Messages,


100
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:03,123 line:-2
an option to enable
automatic sharing is presented.


101
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,527 line:-1
When automatic sharing is turned on,


102
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.299 line:-2 align:center
further content is automatically available
to Shared with You in your app.


103
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:17,304 line:-1
Content in Shared with You is ordered.


104
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:22,910 line:-2
The first item in the Shared with You
shelf is curated by Siri Suggestions


105
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,914 line:-1
based on various signals from the system.


106
00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:30.751 line:-1 align:center
This is followed by Pinned items


107
00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:34.788 line:-2 align:center
and the remainder of the list
is chronologically ordered.


108
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.661 line:-2 align:center
Siri Suggestions uses signals
such as "Has the user viewed


109
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,130 line:-1
or interacted with the content?"


110
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,032 line:-1
Is the content Pinned?


111
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,902 line:-2
In which context
is the content being presented?


112
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:52,539 line:-2
Your app plays a part
in providing this feedback.


113
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:56,443 line:-2
I'll go over in detail
a little later on in the video.


114
00:07:56.476 --> 00:08:02.649 line:-2 align:center
All this is done to ensure that content
is not too transient or stale.


115
00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:07.521 line:-2 align:center
In a conversation
when a link is shared multiple times,


116
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:12,726 line:-2
Shared with You surfaces
only the most recent message.


117
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,331 line:-2
When a link is shared in
multiple Messages conversations,


118
00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:23.470 line:-2 align:center
Shared with You visually represents
that via the attribution view.


119
00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:27.908 line:-2 align:center
For example,
both Enrique and Sarah have shared


120
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,178 line:-1
the Top 25 Chicago playlist.


121
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:36,984 line:-2
The attribution view shows
both their contact avatars.


122
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,889 line:-2
Tapping on the attribution view
presents a disambiguation menu,


123
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:47,861 line:-2
allowing you to choose which Messages
conversation to reply to.


124
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:51,064 line:-2
Security and Privacy
was a primary consideration


125
00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:53.967 line:-1 align:center
and focus when designing Shared with You.


126
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:58,105 line:-2
The attribution views
and disambiguation views


127
00:08:58.138 --> 00:09:02.309 line:-1 align:center
are drawn on your behalf out of process.


128
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,279 line:-2
Shared with You protects
your app's content


129
00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:08.215 line:-1 align:center
via the Universal Links association


130
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:12,219 line:-1
so it is accessible to only your app.


131
00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:17.958 line:-2 align:center
Apps do not have access to Messages
recipients and conversations.


132
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,196 line:-1
Now you know how Shared with You works.


133
00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:24.131 line:-1 align:center
On to the most exciting part–


134
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,568 line:-1
how to adopt Shared with You in your app.


135
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:31.104 line:-1 align:center
First, adopt Universal Links.


136
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:34,441 line:-2
Then, add the new Shared with You
Capability,


137
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:37,411 line:-1
under the Capabilities tab in Xcode.


138
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:41,682 line:-2
Then, put a Shared with You shelf
in your app,


139
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:46,420 line:-2
and add attribution view
to your content.


140
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:50,224 line:-2
Let me briefly talk about
adopting Universal Links.


141
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:56,730 line:-2
Universal Links allows your users
to intelligently follow links to content


142
00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.633 line:-1 align:center
in your app or to your website.


143
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,537 line:-2
Take the following steps
to support universal links.


144
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.974 line:-1 align:center
First create a two-way association


145
00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:10.477 line:-1 align:center
between your app and your website


146
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:14,715 line:-2
and specify the URLs
that your app handles.


147
00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:20.854 line:-2 align:center
You create them by adding the Associated
Domains entitlement to your app,


148
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:26,126 line:-2
and by adding a JSON file
to your web server.


149
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,929 line:-1
Next, update your app delegate


150
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,966 line:-2
to respond to the user activity object
the system provides


151
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,670 line:-1
when a universal link routes to your app.


152
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:42,409 line:0
For more information, please watch
the "What's new in Universal Links" video.


153
00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:47.614 line:-2 align:center
In iOS 16 we have introduced
a new Framework called Shared with You.


154
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:51,752 line:-2
There are three main classes
in the Shared with You Framework:


155
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:54,121 line:-1
SWHighlightCenter,


156
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:59,026 line:-1
SWHighlight, and SWAttributionView.


157
00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:03.497 line:-2 align:center
SWHighlightCenter is the class that helps
you get Shared with You content


158
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,831 line:-1
for your app.


159
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:10,204 line:-2
SWHighlight is a model object
that wraps your app's shared content.


160
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:15,042 line:-2
SWAttributionView is the view
that helps connect your content


161
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,778 line:-1
back to a Messages conversation


162
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,547 line:-1
and displays attribution information.


163
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:25.953 line:-2 align:center
The highlight center is
a simple object that consists of:


164
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:31,358 line:-2
Highlights,
which is an array of SWHighlight objects;


165
00:11:31.391 --> 00:11:35.462 line:-2 align:center
and a delegate property
by which apps get notified


166
00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:41.768 line:-2 align:center
when there is content added,
removed, or updated by Shared with You.


167
00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:46.373 line:-2 align:center
A highlight is represented
by the SWHighlight class.


168
00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:52.513 line:-2 align:center
It is used to pass the URL for your app's
content that was shared in Messages.


169
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:57,317 line:-2
You use it to refer to your content,
render a rich preview,


170
00:11:57.351 --> 00:12:01.021 line:-1 align:center
and navigate to the content in your app.


171
00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:05.726 line:-2 align:center
Let me show you how to enumerate
Shared with You content in your app.


172
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:12,299 line:-2
First create an instance
of SWHighlightCenter.


173
00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:16.670 line:-1 align:center
Then set the delegate property.


174
00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:22.109 line:-2 align:center
Implement the SWHighlightCenterDelegate
method.


175
00:12:22.142 --> 00:12:24.811 line:-2 align:center
Use the highlights property
on the highlight center


176
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:29,149 line:-2
to access your app's Shared with You
content.


177
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:32,786 line:-2
Apps can choose to keep
the previous list of highlights


178
00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:37.491 line:-2 align:center
in order to quickly diff that list
against the latest list.


179
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:44,464 line:-2
Use the URL property on each highlight
to generate a Rich preview


180
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,634 line:-1
of your app's content.


181
00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:53.674 line:-2 align:center
And it's as easy as that to enumerate
Shared with You content in your app.


182
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:59,012 line:-2
Next, I'll show you how to add
and customize the Attribution View


183
00:12:59.046 --> 00:13:01.548 line:-1 align:center
to your app's Shared with You content.


184
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:07,254 line:-2
SWAttributionView is the view
that shows the names and avatars


185
00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:10.090 line:-1 align:center
of who shared the content.


186
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:14,595 line:-2
Each highlight has
a corresponding attribution view.


187
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,831 line:-2
Setting the highlight Property
on the attribution view


188
00:13:17.865 --> 00:13:22.102 line:-2 align:center
triggers the out of process rendering
of the attribution information.


189
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:28,275 line:-2
Specify a maximum width
the attribution view can take.


190
00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:34.281 line:-2 align:center
The attribution view will fill
or fit the space as needed.


191
00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:39.853 line:-2 align:center
Set the alignment of the attribution view
within the maximum space.


192
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,321 line:-1
Let me show you an example.


193
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:46,693 line:-1
Create an instance of SWAttributionView


194
00:13:46.727 --> 00:13:49.897 line:-1 align:center
and set the highlight property.


195
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.699 line:-1 align:center
Set the preferredMaxLayoutWidth.


196
00:13:52.733 --> 00:13:57.905 line:-2 align:center
In this example it spans the bottom
of the shared content thumbnail.


197
00:13:57.938 --> 00:14:00.507 line:-1 align:center
Constrain this view's width anchor


198
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:05.879 line:-2 align:center
or set its frame width to control
the maximum width of its contents.


199
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:09,950 line:-2
Set the maximum AX content size category
for the view as necessary


200
00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:13.153 line:-2 align:center
using:
minimumContentSizeCategory


201
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:18,392 line:-2
or maximumContentSizeCategory
properties on UIView.


202
00:14:18.425 --> 00:14:22.162 line:-2 align:center
Provide enough vertical space
around this view.


203
00:14:22.196 --> 00:14:26.166 line:-2 align:center
The view's height is dependent
on the preferredContentSizeCategory,


204
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.836 line:-1 align:center
and the resulting font size.


205
00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:32.306 line:-2 align:center
If the view's height
is unnecessarily constrained,


206
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,310 line:-2
then the view might be clipped
or not get drawn.


207
00:14:36.343 --> 00:14:40.747 line:-2 align:center
The horizontalAlignment is set
to leading in this case.


208
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:44,084 line:-1
It can also be set to Center


209
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,887 line:-1
or Trailing.


210
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.725 line:-2 align:center
Next, let me show you how to customize
the Attribution view.


211
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,561 line:-2
Setting a display context helps inform
the system


212
00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:58.866 line:-2 align:center
about how the user is consuming
the attributed content.


213
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,303 line:-2
It also influences ranking of
Shared with You content for your app.


214
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:06,106 line:-1
Set this before it's added to a window.


215
00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:10.077 line:-2 align:center
The background style of
the attribution view can be customized


216
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.615 line:-2 align:center
based on the content's background
it is being used against.


217
00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:17.284 line:-1 align:center
Let me show you an example.


218
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:22,990 line:-2
The default value for
displayContext property is summary.


219
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:28,762 line:-2
This indicates that the content
is being shown for consumption.


220
00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:31.198 line:-1 align:center
Set the displayContext to detail


221
00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:34.401 line:-2 align:center
when the user is actively consuming
the content,


222
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:39,173 line:-2
like watching a movie
or listening to a podcast.


223
00:15:39.206 --> 00:15:43.510 line:-2 align:center
Setting the displayContext
is the feedback your app can provide.


224
00:15:43.544 --> 00:15:47.548 line:-2 align:center
This'll help Siri Suggestions
rank content for you app.


225
00:15:47.581 --> 00:15:51.385 line:-2 align:center
Set the background style
for the attribution view to color


226
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:55,355 line:-2
when placing the attribution view
over monochrome backgrounds


227
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,558 line:-1
like in this example.


228
00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:03.964 line:-2 align:center
Use material when placing the attribution
view over multicolored backgrounds.


229
00:16:03.997 --> 00:16:08.669 line:-2 align:center
This sets a material background blur
for the view's contents.


230
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:14,041 line:-2
In this example, Safari's landing page
has a background image.


231
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,611 line:-2
The contents of the attribution view
are more visible


232
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,582 line:-1
by setting the correct background style.


233
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:26,086 line:-2
Next let me show you how to add Shared
with You Contextual Menus


234
00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:30.324 line:-2 align:center
to your app's content
and customize the title.


235
00:16:30.357 --> 00:16:34.127 line:-2 align:center
The existing contextual menu
attached to your app's content


236
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:39,032 line:-2
can be supplemented
by the attribution view's menu.


237
00:16:39.066 --> 00:16:42.669 line:-1 align:center
This menu should be added inline with


238
00:16:42.703 --> 00:16:48.175 line:-2 align:center
or at the end of the contextual menu
it augments.


239
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:53,814 line:-2
A custom title for the Remove contextual
menu option can be provided.


240
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:59,052 line:-2
The string should include the word
"Remove", localized correctly.


241
00:16:59.086 --> 00:17:04.391 line:-2 align:center
In this example, Safari has customized
the Remove menu title to "Remove Link"


242
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:08,762 line:-1
in its content's context menu at the end.


243
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:12,533 line:-2
Let me show you how to do this
via an example.


244
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:16,036 line:-2
First create an instance
of the attribution view


245
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,505 line:-1
and set the highlight property.


246
00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:21.975 line:-2 align:center
Provide a custom title
for the Remove context menu


247
00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:24.945 line:-1 align:center
via the menuTitleForHideAction.


248
00:17:24.978 --> 00:17:28.081 line:-2 align:center
When configuring
your content's context menu,


249
00:17:28.115 --> 00:17:34.188 line:-2 align:center
get the menu from the attribution view
via the supplementalMenu property.


250
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:38.692 line:-2 align:center
Then append them
to your content's context menu.


251
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:43,363 line:-2
These easy steps allow your app
to add the context menu option


252
00:17:43.397 --> 00:17:49.336 line:-2 align:center
available on the attribution view
to your content's context menus.


253
00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:54.508 line:-2 align:center
Now you know all that is needed
to adopt Shared with You in your app.


254
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:59,680 line:-2
Let's recap the three easy steps
to adopt Shared with You in your app.


255
00:17:59.713 --> 00:18:01.849 line:-1 align:center
Go adopt Universal Links.


256
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:07,354 line:-2
Then add the new Shared with You
Capability in Xcode for your app.


257
00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:11.625 line:-2 align:center
Import and use the new
Shared with You framework.


258
00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:15.462 line:-2 align:center
I'm looking forward to sharing
your content in Messages


259
00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:18.498 line:-1 align:center
and using Shared with You in your app.


260
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:21,869 line:-1
Thank you for your time and attention.
