00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,678 line:-2
- Hello, I'm Josh
and I'm a software engineer


4
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,714 line:-1
on the Apple Business Essentials team.


5
00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.983 line:-2 align:center
As a small business,
you may find yourself managing


6
00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.785 line:-2 align:center
an increasing number of devices
as your team expands.


7
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,421 line:-2
The IT demands that come with this
can be a lot to take on,


8
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,391 line:-2
taking time away
from doing what you do best.


9
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,693 line:-1
Apple Business Essentials makes this easy


10
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,963 line:-2
with a subscription that seamlessly
brings together device management,


11
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,733 line:-1
24/7 support, and cloud storage


12
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.302 line:-2 align:center
so your small business can manage
every employee's iPhone,


13
00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.639 line:-1 align:center
iPad and Mac every step of the way.


14
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,175 line:-1
And for your employees, it's simple.


15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,777 line:-2
All they need to do is sign in
with a Managed Apple ID,


16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,547 line:-2
and their devices are set up
with Apple Business Essentials.


17
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,349 line:-1
Once they're signed in,


18
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,052 line:-2
devices are automatically configured
with the settings they need,


19
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:56,290 line:-2
including critical security settings
like FileVault and passcode policies


20
00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:59.960 line:-2 align:center
as well as all of the apps
they need to be productive.


21
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,563 line:-2
Plus, the iCloud storage to store,
collaborate on,


22
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,132 line:-1
and share documents in iCloud Drive.


23
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,869 line:-2
They can even use iCloud backups
for their iPhones and iPads.


24
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:14,007 line:-2
When something goes wrong, AppleCare+
for Business Essentials is there to help.


25
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,743 line:-2
Repair credits are shared
across the entire organization


26
00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:20.380 line:-2 align:center
and can be used for any device
under a plan with coverage.


27
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,849 align:center
In fact, Apple Business Essentials


28
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,283 line:0
helps you with every step


29
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,118 line:0
of the device lifecycle.


30
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,854 line:0
In this session, we'll explore the ways


31
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,255 line:0
you can take advantage of


32
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,191 align:center
everything the subscription has to offer.


33
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:35,829 line:-2
We'll review the first step: getting
an account in Apple Business Manager.


34
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:39,266 line:-2
We'll start a new Apple Business
Essentials subscription,


35
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,401 line:-1
add settings and apps,


36
00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:43.504 line:-2 align:center
and explore how the experience
looks for employees


37
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,339 line:-1
as they enroll their devices.


38
00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:46.974 line:-1 align:center
Let's get started.


39
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,879 line:-2
Apple Business Essentials exists inside
of Apple Business Manager


40
00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:55.782 line:-2 align:center
where you manage devices,
add users, and purchase apps.


41
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,453 line:-2
To subscribe to Apple Business Essentials
as your device management solution,


42
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,055 line:-2
you first need an
Apple Business Manager account.


43
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,760 line:0
Sign up by visiting business.apple.com


44
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,629 line:0
and entering your company name,


45
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,731 line:0
DUNS number, and contact information.


46
00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.702 line:-2 align:center
Once you have an account,
the next step is to add users.


47
00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:19.006 line:-2 align:center
You add individual users by
manually entering their information


48
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,076 line:-2
or sync an existing list of users
from a Microsoft Azure Directory


49
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,411 line:-1
or Google Workspace.


50
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,381 line:-1
Many of your users share common needs,


51
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,616 line:-1
like a sales department or field workers,


52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,519 line:-2
so you want them to get
the same settings and apps.


53
00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:36.223 line:-2 align:center
To prepare for this, make user groups
with the users you just created.


54
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,927 line:-1
And save time using 'smart user groups'


55
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.230 line:-2 align:center
which automatically creates groups
based on common attributes


56
00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:46.400 line:-1 align:center
like division, location, and role.


57
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,036 line:-2
Now that I have
my Apple Business Manager account


58
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,672 line:-1
and I've set up some users and groups,


59
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,308 line:-2
I'm ready to enroll
in Apple Business Essentials.


60
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,244 line:-2
Let's go to the Mac;
here's Apple Business Manager.


61
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:03,150 line:-2
I find Subscription in the sidebar
and start a free trial .


62
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,820 line:-2
I need to choose whether this is
an employee plan or a device plan.


63
00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:11.225 line:-2 align:center
Employee plans are just that--
plans for devices used by my employees.


64
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:15,062 line:-2
Device plans are also available for things
like conference room devices,


65
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,497 line:-1
kiosks, loaners, or other cases


66
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,300 line:-2
where the device is not assigned
to a specific employee.


67
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:25,339 line:-2
Next is the number of devices
per employee, either just 1 or up to 3.


68
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.808 line:-1 align:center
I'm setting up a plan for my sales team.


69
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:31,078 line:-2
I know they're on the road frequently
and usually have a work MacBook


70
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:33.013 line:-1 align:center
as well as an iPhone and iPad,


71
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,383 line:-2
so I'll set them up
with a three-device plan.


72
00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.452 line:-1 align:center
Next, storage.


73
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:42,456 line:-2
With the subscription, my employees get
an iCloud account dedicated for work


74
00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.526 line:-2 align:center
so they can access their files
and folders across their devices.


75
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:49,463 line:-2
I'll stick with 200 GB for now;
this should be plenty to start with.


76
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,665 line:-2
But if my team's needs
change in the future,


77
00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.600 line:-1 align:center
I can update it at any time.


78
00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:57.571 line:-2 align:center
Last, I select AppleCare+
for Business Essentials for repair,


79
00:03:57.604 --> 00:04:01.742 line:-2 align:center
service and support; perfect for
my sales staff who are out in the field.


80
00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:06.980 line:-2 align:center
Next, I add user groups
and individual users.


81
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:11,318 line:-2
Let's search for the sales team
and add them to this plan.


82
00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:14.922 line:-2 align:center
I've already entered
my payment information.


83
00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.992 line:-1 align:center
I review the pricing...


84
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,994 line:-1
and add the plan.


85
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,964 line:-2
As my business grows,
having multiple plans lets me cover


86
00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.366 line:-2 align:center
all the unique needs
of my employees and devices,


87
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.571 line:-2 align:center
and when I make changes at any time,
I'll only pay for what I use.


88
00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:32.806 line:-2 align:center
My Apple Business Manager view
updates to reflect


89
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,576 line:-2
that I'm subscribed to
Apple Business Essentials


90
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,545 line:-2
and I now see Settings
and Collections in the sidebar.


91
00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:43.116 line:-2 align:center
Settings provides a list of configurations
I automatically push to a managed device.


92
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.287 line:-2 align:center
Apps provides a list of apps to purchase
for my users to download on their devices


93
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,189 line:-1
with the Essentials app.


94
00:04:49.223 --> 00:04:53.894 line:-2 align:center
Collections are a group of Settings
and Apps that I assign to users or groups.


95
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,363 line:-2
We'll get started
by exploring the settings.


96
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,267 line:-2
The Essentials category brings together
the settings I'm most likely to use.


97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,270 line:-2
But I have a number of options here,
so let's understand what they are


98
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,506 line:-1
and then add the ones I need.


99
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,377 line:-2
The security tab brings together
all your critical security settings


100
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,113 line:-1
to one place so they're easy to configure.


101
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.916 line:-2 align:center
For my iOS devices,
I want a password setting.


102
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,451 line:-1
I'll do that shortly.


103
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,554 line:-2
For my macOS devices,
I add the FileVault setting


104
00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:23.190 line:-2 align:center
to ensure my employee's Macs
encrypt their data.


105
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,059 line:-2
I turn on Application Layer Firewall
to protect against threats


106
00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:29.530 line:-2 align:center
from incoming network traffic
to untrusted apps.


107
00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:33.567 line:-2 align:center
I turn on Gatekeeper to prevent
untrusted apps from running altogether.


108
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,405 line:-2
Moving on to the network category,
I configure my devices with AirPrint


109
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,308 line:-2
to automatically connect to my printers
and use the Wi-Fi setting


110
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,511 line:-2
to configure trusted networks
so they're available automatically


111
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,613 line:-1
when the user signs in to their device.


112
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:50.250 line:-2 align:center
Personalization provides
additional settings that I can use


113
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,986 line:-2
to customize the experience
for the devices in my fleet.


114
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.592 line:-2 align:center
For example, I use conference room display
to restrict my apple TVs to airplay only.


115
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,894 line:-2
For my macOS devices,
the login Window setting


116
00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:03.163 line:-2 align:center
allows me to display a message
on the login window,


117
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,066 line:-2
which is great for showing things
like support email addresses


118
00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.502 line:-1 align:center
or phone numbers.


119
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,506 line:-2
Let's go back to the essentials category
to add a few of these settings.


120
00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:17.244 line:-2 align:center
We'll create a new configured setting
and name it Password Policy.


121
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,520 line:-2
The check boxes are on
for both macOS and iOS,


122
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,556 line:0
and let's leave on the switch on
for "password and security options"


123
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,693 line:0
to require my users
to create a strong password.


124
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,596 line:-2
I select the "no" option
for "allow simple passwords"


125
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,398 line:-2
to require my employees to choose
at least one special character


126
00:06:38.432 --> 00:06:40.200 line:-1 align:center
as part of their password,


127
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,237 line:-2
and 'yes' for
"require alpha numeric password"


128
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.740 line:-2 align:center
requires at least one letter and number
for their password.


129
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,408 line:-1
Let's save this setting.


130
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:53,146 align:center
And here it is, added to my settings list.


131
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,517 line:-2
Next, I configure Wi-Fi passwords
so my employees' devices


132
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,552 line:-1
automatically join a known Wi-Fi network.


133
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,555 line:-2
I'll name this setting
BetterBag Secure Wi-Fi.


134
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,495 line:-2
I enter my company's Wi-Fi name...
and password.


135
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,101 line:0
I leave the "network visibility"
as visible,


136
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,304 line:0
leave "auto join" as "yes" and save.


137
00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:21.008 line:-1 align:center
Let's move on to apps.


138
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:27,014 line:-2
The Apps page is where I get
apps, both paid and free,


139
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:30,951 line:-2
that my users then install with
the Essentials app on their device.


140
00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:34.321 line:-2 align:center
Here I have the apps and books available
from the Apple App Store


141
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,889 line:-1
as well as any Custom Apps


142
00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:38.892 line:-2 align:center
that have been made available
specifically for me to purchase.


143
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:42,596 line:-2
I'd like all my users to have the Pages
app for iOS available to install,


144
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,499 line:-1
so let's search for and get Pages.


145
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:54,308 line:-2
When my users install Pages from the
Essentials app, the app is managed,


146
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:56.643 line:-1 align:center
which means updates happen automatically,


147
00:07:56.677 --> 00:08:00.214 line:-2 align:center
and the app will be uninstalled
if the user signs out of the device.


148
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,950 line:-1
I assign the app to my office.


149
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:10,157 line:-2
I need 4 licenses, and I confirm
the price--free, in this case.


150
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.593 line:-1 align:center
Let's get the licenses for the app.


151
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,265 line:-2
Now that I have settings configured
and apps purchased,


152
00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:21.368 line:-2 align:center
let's group them together
into a Collection.


153
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:25,572 line:-2
A Collection applies a combination of
settings and apps to users and groups.


154
00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:28.242 line:-2 align:center
This ensures that employees' devices
are configured correctly


155
00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:30.143 line:-2 align:center
and they have access
to the apps that they need


156
00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:32.079 line:-1 align:center
as soon as they sign in to their devices.


157
00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:36.717 line:-2 align:center
I create a new Collection
for my sales team and name it Sales.


158
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,988 line:-2
I add apps to my collection
in the apps tab.


159
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.589 line:-1 align:center
Let's add Pages.


160
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,129 line:-2
Similarly, I add settings to
my collection in the settings tab.


161
00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:55.235 line:-1 align:center
Let's search for and add the Wi-Fi


162
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,870 line:-1
and password policy settings.


163
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:02,442 line:-2
Finally, I add my Sales team to
this collection in the User Groups tab.


164
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,815 line:-2
I just search for the Sales User group
and add it.


165
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:15,422 line:-2
Let's save, and I can now see
my newly created collection.


166
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:20,294 line:-2
Okay. I have apps and settings,
and I've assigned them to my employees.


167
00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:23.864 line:-2 align:center
Now, I need to give the employees
a way to sign in to their devices.


168
00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:28.602 line:-2 align:center
In the User list,
let's find one of my employees,


169
00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:30.003 line:-1 align:center
Eliza...


170
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,941 line:-1
And create a Managed Apple ID for her.


171
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:39,746 line:-2
Either I download a file with
the user name and temporary password


172
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,884 line:-2
or send Eliza an email with her
Managed Apple ID credentials directly.


173
00:09:47.321 --> 00:09:50.858 line:-2 align:center
Let's explore what this looks like
from Eliza's perspective.


174
00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.794 line:-2 align:center
She has a company iPad
and a personal iPhone.


175
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:57,831 line:-2
She uses her Managed Apple ID
we created to enroll both devices.


176
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,100 line:-1
Let's start with the company-owned iPad.


177
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,238 line:-2
Because this iPad
was purchased specifically


178
00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:07.374 line:-2 align:center
for my organization through Apple
or an authorized reseller,


179
00:10:07.407 --> 00:10:11.645 line:-2 align:center
Eliza gets the Work sign-in
right when she sets up her device.


180
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,948 line:-2
She enters the username and
password from the email I sent her.


181
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,784 line:-1
Upon completing setup,


182
00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:21.154 line:-2 align:center
the device automatically joins the office
Wi-Fi network that I've set up


183
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,923 line:-1
and the Essentials app is installed.


184
00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:27.694 line:-1 align:center
Next, she sets up her personal iPhone.


185
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,631 line:-2
This device is already signed in
with her personal Apple ID


186
00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:33.567 line:-1 align:center
and has all of her personal apps and data.


187
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,135 line:-1
With Apple Business Essentials,


188
00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:38.138 line:-2 align:center
Eliza can sign in to
her work account separately.


189
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:41,041 line:-2
She goes to the settings app,
selects general,


190
00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:43.710 line:-1 align:center
VPN and Device Management,


191
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,246 line:-1
and sign in with a work or school account.


192
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.650 line:-1 align:center
Then she enters her username and password.


193
00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:52.152 line:-2 align:center
Now her iPhone is signed into
both her personal account


194
00:10:52.186 --> 00:10:54.721 line:-1 align:center
and her Apple Business Essentials account.


195
00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:57.724 line:-2 align:center
The best part is that these are
crytographically separated,


196
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,294 line:-1
meaning her personal data stays private


197
00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:03.397 line:-2 align:center
while her work data
remains managed and secure.


198
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,568 line:-2
Once enrolled,
Eliza has all the settings


199
00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:11.939 line:-2 align:center
automatically deployed to her device,
and the Essentials app is downloaded.


200
00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:16.076 line:-2 align:center
She uses it to install all the apps
I've assigned to her.


201
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,047 line:-2
On the devices tab,
she has all her devices


202
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.682 line:-1 align:center
and the Apple Support button.


203
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,951 line:-2
If something goes wrong
with one of her devices,


204
00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:26.854 line:-2 align:center
she initiates a repair request
from inside the Essentials app


205
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,356 line:-1
with the "Visit Apple Support" button.


206
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,492 line:-2
Once approved, she requests
a repair technician to come to her


207
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,697 line:-2
or she brings the device to an
Apple Authorized Service Provider.


208
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,502 line:-2
I see the status in Service and Support,
where I approve or deny the request.


209
00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:46.273 line:-2 align:center
With Apple Business Essentials,
as your needs change,


210
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,643 line:-2
you go back and revisit
your apps and settings.


211
00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:53.313 line:-2 align:center
The changes you make are automatically
pushed to your employees' devices.


212
00:11:54.114 --> 00:11:58.285 line:-2 align:center
If a device is lost or needs to be
re-provisioned, you select the device,


213
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:02,289 line:-2
and either "sign out user",
"lock device" or "erase,"


214
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,325 line:-1
and the action is taken on the device.


215
00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:08.095 line:-2 align:center
And that employee replacing
or upgrading their device


216
00:12:08.128 --> 00:12:11.198 line:-2 align:center
just needs to sign in to a new device
with their Managed Apple ID


217
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,201 line:-2
to access their apps,
settings, and work data in iCloud.


218
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,771 line:-1
Let's wrap up.


219
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,541 line:-2
We reviewed how to get set up
in Apple Business Manager.


220
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,676 line:-2
We subscribed
to Apple Business Essentials,


221
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,445 line:-1
making a few key decisions along the way.


222
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,314 line:-2
We added settings and apps
to collections


223
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,917 line:-2
which we assigned
to a user group of employees


224
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.488 line:-2 align:center
and explored how the experience
looks for employees on their devices.


225
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:38,792 line:-2
Apple Business Essentials, currently
available to U.S.-based small businesses,


226
00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:42.763 line:-2 align:center
lets you get back to doing
what you do best, faster.


227
00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:46.066 line:-2 align:center
It's simple to manage the entire life of
your employees' devices


228
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,436 line:-2
with easy set up and onboarding,
security and privacy,


229
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,339 line:-1
storage and backup, support and repair,


230
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:56,009 line:-2
and updates
with one flexible subscription.


231
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:58,645 align:center
