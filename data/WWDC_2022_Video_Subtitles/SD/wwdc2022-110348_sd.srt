00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.447 line:-2 align:center
- Welcome to "Build your first
app in Swift Playgrounds."


4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,684 line:-2
I am Collett Charlton, an engineer
on the Swift Playgrounds team.


5
00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:19.019 line:-1 align:center
- And I'm Connor Wakamo,


6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,588 line:-2
another engineer
on the Swift Playgrounds team.


7
00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:26.159 line:-2 align:center
- Swift Playgrounds has been a great
tool for learning to code in Swift,


8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:31,498 line:-2
and now you can take things
a step further and build apps too!


9
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:36,170 line:-2
Today, we're going to walk through
building an app in Swift Playgrounds,


10
00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:38.472 line:-1 align:center
starting with a blank template.


11
00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.809 line:-2 align:center
We'll then show how to debug issues
using previews and the console,


12
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:46,446 line:-2
and finally,
we'll submit our app to TestFlight.


13
00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:52.719 line:-2 align:center
Something our team really loves
is making and drinking tea.


14
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:56,857 line:-2
We love it so much
that we want to make an app for that.


15
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.094 line:-2 align:center
Connor and I are going to build
a little app to help us at tea time,


16
00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:06.033 line:-2 align:center
giving us a list of teas to
help us pick what to drink each day.


17
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,970 line:-2
Swift Playgrounds
works great on Mac and iPad.


18
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,738 line:-1
I've got my Mac with me today,


19
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,008 line:-2
so I'm going to start
building this app there.


20
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:20,614 line:-2
Whether you are new to coding,
or are an experienced developer,


21
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:25,018 line:-2
Swift Playgrounds offers a variety
of templates and instructional content


22
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,753 line:-1
to get you started.


23
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:31,391 line:-2
For our tea app, we'll begin by clicking
the blank App template


24
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,827 line:-1
in the bottom left corner of the screen.


25
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:40.801 line:-2 align:center
Now that we have our template,
let's double click to open.


26
00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:48.442 line:-2 align:center
Great. On the right is a live interactive
preview showing the Hello World text.


27
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,549 line:-2
Before we start coding, let's customize
the app a little using the App Settings.


28
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,485 line:-2
To do this,
I'll click the app settings button


29
00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:00.988 line:-1 align:center
in the top left corner of the sidebar.


30
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:06,660 line:-2
Here, you can customize various
project properties like the app name


31
00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.695 line:-1 align:center
and the accent color.


32
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.399 line:-2 align:center
You can also add a custom
or placeholder app icon,


33
00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:17.437 line:-2 align:center
capabilities, or purpose string,
and a bundleID.


34
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:20.274 line:-1 align:center
I'll update the app's name to Tea Time.


35
00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.679 line:-1 align:center
I'll set the accent color to brown.


36
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:30,217 line:-2
And I'll update
the placeholder icon to the mug.


37
00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:35.756 line:-2 align:center
Great. Now that the important part's
out of the way,


38
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,393 line:-2
let's start writing some code
by selecting the template text


39
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:43,163 line:-2
and replacing it
with our first View from the Library.


40
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:50,237 line:-2
The Library can be accessed by clicking
the plus button in the project toolbar.


41
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,807 line:-2
It contains easy-to-use snippets
of different Views,


42
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:59,379 line:-1
Modifiers, SF Symbols, and Colors.


43
00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:03.016 line:-2 align:center
We'll be using a List View
to display our list of teas,


44
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,921 line:-2
so I'll type list into the search field
and click it to insert one.


45
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,895 line:-2
Now that we have our List View,
let's add some tea items to it.


46
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,132 line:-1
I'll start typing Text...


47
00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:20.734 line:-1 align:center
and use the return key


48
00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:23.670 line:-2 align:center
to accept and insert
the code completion suggestion


49
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,240 line:-1
from the inline code completion panel.


50
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:35.048 line:-2 align:center
Alright, now we have our List View
with one tea added.


51
00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:36.884 line:-1 align:center
Let's add some more.


52
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:46,460 line:-2
Wait, it looks like I accidentally
added Jasmine Green twice.


53
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:51,431 line:-2
In order to avoid duplicating our teas,
we should store them as an orderedSet.


54
00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:56.069 line:-2 align:center
Luckily for us, Apple's swift-collection
package offers just that.


55
00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:59.306 line:-2 align:center
So, let's add the swift-collection package
to our project.


56
00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:04.578 line:-2 align:center
To do this, let's open the File Menu
and select Add Package.


57
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:11,985 line:-2
I'll begin by entering the URL
for the swift-collections package,


58
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:12,853 line:-1
and then press the return key.


59
00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:20.294 line:-2 align:center
After the package is fetched,
we can see the package version


60
00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:23.664 line:-2 align:center
and other products
that can be added to our project.


61
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:28,335 line:-2
For this app, we'll only select
Collections then click Add to Project.


62
00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:36.577 line:-2 align:center
Now we have swift-collections added to our
project in the sidebar under Packages.


63
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.381 line:-2 align:center
Let's create an OrderedSet of String
to store our list of teas.


64
00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:50.824 line:-1 align:center
Wait. It seems like we have an issue.


65
00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:53.393 line:-2 align:center
Let's take a look
by clicking the issue icon.


66
00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:57.497 line:-2 align:center
"Cannot find type ordered set
in scope."


67
00:04:57.531 --> 00:05:00.701 line:-1 align:center
Oh, I see what the problem is.


68
00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:03.937 line:-2 align:center
I forgot to import the Collections module
in our project.


69
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.373 line:-2 align:center
Let's import that,
and the issue should be resolved.


70
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,582 line:-1
Now that we have resolved that issue,


71
00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:19.419 line:-2 align:center
let's update our List View to use
the collection we just created.


72
00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:22.656 line:-1 align:center
To do this, we'll use a ForEach View.


73
00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:45.712 line:-1 align:center
Alright, there we have it--


74
00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:49.449 line:-2 align:center
our list of teas being displayed
from our tea collection.


75
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,919 line:-1
As I'm working on this project,


76
00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:55.789 line:-2 align:center
I'm getting more and more ideas
on features to add.


77
00:05:55,822 --> 00:06:00,127 line:-2
It would be so cool if our app
could listen for whistling tea kettles


78
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.896 line:-1 align:center
to let us know when it's time to pour.


79
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.165 line:-1 align:center
I'm not going to implement this now,


80
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,835 line:-2
but let's walk through the steps
we would take


81
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:12,105 line:-2
to explain to users
why our app needs to use the microphone.


82
00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:17.344 line:-2 align:center
To add this,
let's go back into our app settings...


83
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.346 line:-1 align:center
and click Capabilities.


84
00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:23.650 line:-2 align:center
Using the plus button
in the top righthand corner,


85
00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:27.020 line:-2 align:center
we'll get a list of capabilities
we can add to our project.


86
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,490 line:-1
Let's find microphone and click it to add.


87
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:35,963 line:-2
For the purpose string, we'll write:
"Tea Time uses the microphone


88
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:38,265 line:-1
to listen for whistling tea kettles."


89
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:41,702 line:-2
I'll click add,
and then close app settings.


90
00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:49.476 line:-2 align:center
Alright, we've done a lot today,
and I'm excited to share the project


91
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,212 line:-1
and the cool ideas I have with Connor.


92
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,818 line:-2
I'll share it with Connor by adding it
to our shared iCloud folder.


93
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:01,955 line:-2
But first, let's give it
a better filename than My App.


94
00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:12.566 line:-2 align:center
Now, I'll drag it to the shared
iCloud Folder.


95
00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:20.007 line:-2 align:center
Now that I'm done, I'm going to hand it
over to Connor to finish the app.


96
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.844 line:-2 align:center
Thanks Collett.
I'm going to pick things up on iPad.


97
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:26,980 line:-2
Since we're sharing our project
via an iCloud Shared Folder,


98
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,583 line:-2
it doesn't show up
in the main list of projects.


99
00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.119 line:-1 align:center
But if I tap on "Locations,"


100
00:07:32.152 --> 00:07:34.888 line:-2 align:center
I can get access to projects
from elsewhere in iCloud,


101
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,758 line:-2
or even from
third-party document providers.


102
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.760 line:-1 align:center
I'm already in our Shared Folder,


103
00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.829 line:-2 align:center
so I'll tap on Tea Time
to open the project.


104
00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:47.067 line:-2 align:center
Any changes I make will automatically
be reflected in the shared project.


105
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.803 line:-2 align:center
It looks like Collett
is such a good engineer


106
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:53,473 line:-2
that just uploading the project to iCloud
added some extra features!


107
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:57,578 line:-2
She implemented a TabView here
so we don't just have a list of teas


108
00:07:57.611 --> 00:07:59.847 line:-1 align:center
but also an Assistant.


109
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,782 line:-1
If I tap on the Assistant tab,


110
00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.952 line:-2 align:center
it's a little bit bare-bones,
but it does the job.


111
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,555 line:-2
I can ask for a recommendation,
and it'll give me a tea I should drink.


112
00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:12.726 line:-2 align:center
Seems today I should have
the Jasmine Green.


113
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:17,064 line:-2
Now I know Collett was working on
a fun new way to pick teas


114
00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:18.966 line:-1 align:center
to give this a little extra pizzaz.


115
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,134 line:-1
Let's open the sidebar to try to find it.


116
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,874 line:-2
TeaWheelView seems promising,
so let's tap on that to open it.


117
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,945 line:-2
We've got a View
which takes a collection of data.


118
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,982 line:-2
Let's add a view preview
so we can try TeaWheelView out


119
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,584 line:-1
before it's a part of the main app.


120
00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:39.520 line:-1 align:center
I'll scroll to the bottom of the file...


121
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.325 line:-1 align:center
And I'll begin typing "preview provider."


122
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.531 line:-2 align:center
I'll accept the code completion
suggestion by pressing the Return key,


123
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:54,234 line:-1
and I'll name it TeaWheelView_Previews.


124
00:08:56.436 --> 00:08:59.506 line:-2 align:center
Page dots have now appeared
at the bottom of the preview area,


125
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.544 line:-2 align:center
which tells me that Swift Playgrounds
recognizes my preview provider.


126
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:07,681 line:-2
If I tap on the right chevron
underneath the app preview…


127
00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:11.618 line:-2 align:center
then I can use my view preview
instead of the app preview.


128
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,620 line:-1
Right now it just says "Hello, world!"


129
00:09:13.654 --> 00:09:16.657 line:-2 align:center
so let's add in some code
to create a TeaWheelView.


130
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.694 line:-2 align:center
First I'll add an array with a few items
in it as a static property


131
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,030 line:-1
so it can be used by my preview.


132
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,972 line:-2
I'll leave the insertion point
between the two square brackets


133
00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:35.976 line:-2 align:center
and then I'll drag on the closing bracket
to create placeholders for a few items.


134
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:44,551 line:-2
Next, I'll replace the placeholders with
a few strings that'll serve as our items.


135
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:56,029 line:-2
Now that we've got a few items,
let's add in the TeaWheelView.


136
00:09:56.063 --> 00:09:57.865 line:-1 align:center
I'll select the Hello, world! example


137
00:09:57.898 --> 00:10:01.001 line:-2 align:center
and replace it with a TeaWheelView
that displays my items.


138
00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:12.813 line:-1 align:center
I'll also add in a little bit of padding.


139
00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:19.019 line:-2 align:center
Great! Now our view preview
is showing a wheel,


140
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,888 line:-1
and what a beautiful wheel it is!


141
00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:26.527 line:-2 align:center
I can spin it, and it'll pick different
items based on where it lands.


142
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,631 line:-2
Let's go back to the assistant tab
and add this wheel in.


143
00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:34.768 line:-2 align:center
I'll use the sidebar to open
the AssistantTab Swift file,


144
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,238 line:-2
and I'm going to delete the Button and
replace it with a TeaWheelView instead.


145
00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:51.451 line:-2 align:center
TeaWheelView
optionally takes an action closure


146
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,720 line:-2
which is called
when the wheel stops spinning.


147
00:10:55,622 --> 00:11:00,494 line:0
I'll use it to set last picked tea
to the selected tea,


148
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:05,399 align:center
and I'll set show pick alert to true
so SwiftUI knows to show the alert.


149
00:11:08.869 --> 00:11:12.339 line:-2 align:center
Okay, great! We've got our wheel in here,
so now let's try it!


150
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:17,411 line:-2
I'll swipe to spin it...
and it told me to drink Byte's Oolong.


151
00:11:17.444 --> 00:11:19.546 line:-1 align:center
I'll swipe it again...


152
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.251 line:-1 align:center
And it's still Byte's Oolong.


153
00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:25.919 line:-1 align:center
One more time.


154
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,391 line:-1
Hmm. Something seems wrong.


155
00:11:31.425 --> 00:11:33.627 line:-2 align:center
Even though it's landing on
different spots on the wheel,


156
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.830 line:-2 align:center
it's always telling me
to drink the Byte's Oolong.


157
00:11:36.864 --> 00:11:40.634 line:-2 align:center
While that is a good tea,
I'd like a little bit of variety.


158
00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:43.370 line:-2 align:center
Let's switch back to the wheel view
and try to figure out what's up.


159
00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:47.341 line:-2 align:center
It's not obvious from this
what's going wrong,


160
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,410 line:-2
since the wheel does spin
and land on different spots.


161
00:11:50.444 --> 00:11:52.880 line:-2 align:center
Let's add a print statement
into our view preview


162
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,048 line:-1
to check if the preview is broken too.


163
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,458 line:-1
Now when I spin the wheel...


164
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:09,463 line:-2
A console message pops up
at the bottom left of the source editor.


165
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,765 line:-1
Item one...


166
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:15,035 line:-1
item one…item one.


167
00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:18.338 line:-1 align:center
Aha! Each spin gives us item one,


168
00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:21.175 line:-2 align:center
which suggests something
isn't quite hooked up right!


169
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,877 line:-2
Since it's giving me
the first one every time,


170
00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:28.215 line:-2 align:center
I'm going to use project-wide find
to search for first.


171
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.484 line:-2 align:center
I'll tap in the search field
at the top of the sidebar


172
00:12:30.517 --> 00:12:33.120 line:-1 align:center
on the left hand side of the screen


173
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,557 line:-1
and then type "first" and press Return.


174
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,428 line:-2
That result seems promising,
so I'll tap on it.


175
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,933 line:-2
Ah, it looks like Collett left
some debugging code in here


176
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:50,103 line:-2
that made it return the first item
every time instead of the right result.


177
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,940 line:-2
Let's fix that up real quick
and then give it another spin.


178
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,715 line:-1
Item two...


179
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,217 line:-1
item four.


180
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.652 line:-1 align:center
Great! It seems to be working now.


181
00:13:05.686 --> 00:13:07.788 line:-1 align:center
If we switch back to our app preview


182
00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:10.524 line:-2 align:center
by tapping on the left chevron
underneath the preview,


183
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,260 line:-1
we can try it out in the real app.


184
00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:18.198 line:-2 align:center
I'll spin the wheel, and it's telling me
to have the English Breakfast.


185
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,701 line:-1
So now we've got a working assistant.


186
00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:24.571 line:-2 align:center
Awesome! Just to confirm
the app works well at all sizes,


187
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:28,008 line:-2
I can run it in its own window
by pressing the Run button


188
00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:29.943 line:-1 align:center
in the upper left of the screen.


189
00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:35.616 line:-1 align:center
Okay, seems like everything is here.


190
00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:38.685 line:-2 align:center
I've got my list of teas,
and I've got the assistant here


191
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:41,255 line:-1
with the wheel and everything.


192
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,524 line:-2
I can go back to the project
in Swift Playgrounds


193
00:13:43.557 --> 00:13:46.260 line:-2 align:center
by tapping on the little Swift icon
in the status bar,


194
00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:50.130 line:-2 align:center
and then by selecting the "Show Project"
button in the sheet that pops up.


195
00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:56.103 line:-2 align:center
I'm ready to test this app myself
and with my friends and family.


196
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,405 line:-1
Swift Playgrounds makes it easy to test


197
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,340 line:-2
because you can submit
directly to TestFlight


198
00:14:00.374 --> 00:14:02.009 line:-1 align:center
from within Swift Playgrounds!


199
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:07,481 line:0
If I bring up the app settings sheet
and scroll to the bottom,


200
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,250 line:0
there's an
"Upload to App Store Connect" button.


201
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:14,121 line:0
If I tap on that, Swift Playgrounds
does all of the hard work


202
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,658 align:center
of creating an app record and
uploading my app to App Store Connect


203
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:21,495 line:0
so I can distribute it on TestFlight
and eventually the App Store.


204
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:31,405 line:-2
Now that my app is uploaded,
I can go to App Store Connect


205
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,740 line:-1
and submit it for Beta App Review.


206
00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:36.844 line:-2 align:center
After waiting a bit,
we can go over to the TestFlight app


207
00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:39.980 line:-1 align:center
and install it from there, even on iPhone!


208
00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:45.118 line:-1 align:center
I'll tap "Install" to install Tea Time.


209
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:50,290 line:-2
Now that it's installed,
I'll tap "Open" to open it.


210
00:14:50.324 --> 00:14:52.826 line:-1 align:center
I'll tap to the test notes,


211
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,596 line:-2
as well as these instructions
on how to provide feedback.


212
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,534 line:-2
And there you have it--
our app is running on iPhone.


213
00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.603 line:-1 align:center
What tea should I have today?


214
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,374 line:-2
Looks like I'm having
the Matt P's Tea Party.


215
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,944 line:-2
Today, Collett and I showed you
how you can use Swift Playgrounds


216
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:13,480 line:-1
on your Mac and iPad to build apps.


217
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:17,217 line:-2
We demonstrated using the library
and code completion to insert new code,


218
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,487 line:-2
we shared our project
via iCloud Shared Folders,


219
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:24,758 line:-2
and we used view previews and the
console to debug an issue with our code.


220
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,328 line:-2
We even submitted an app to TestFlight,
right from iPad!


221
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,697 line:-2
Hopefully you've learned
a thing or two along the way,


222
00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:33.667 line:-2 align:center
and we can't wait to see what
you build with Swift Playgrounds.


223
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.938 line:-2 align:center
Thank you for watching,
and enjoy the rest of WWDC!
