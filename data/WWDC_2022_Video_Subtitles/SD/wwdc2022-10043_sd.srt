Hello, and welcome to "What's
New in App Store Connect."


5
00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.815 line:-1 position:50%
My name's Will Averill,
and I'm an engineering manager


6
00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.150 line:-1 position:50%
on the App Store Connect team.


7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,053 line:-1
App Store Connect has grown
considerably over the years.


8
00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.489 line:-1 position:50%
You use it to create,
manage, and grow your apps


9
00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.425 line:-1 position:50%
on the App Store
across all of our platforms.


10
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,895 line:-1
And we continue to bring new
features to App Store Connect


11
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:33,500 line:-1
on web, our iOS and iPadOS app,
and the App Store Connect API.


12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,637 line:-1
Just last year, we launched
a bunch of great new features.


13
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,273 line:-1
You've probably heard all about
things like in-app events,


14
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,942 line:-1
custom product pages,
and TestFlight for Mac.


15
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,744 line:-1
So instead,
let me quickly highlight


16
00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:46.546 line:-1 position:50%
a couple recent updates
you might have missed.


17
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,916 line:-1
In TestFlight, we made
managing your build's


18
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,518 line:-1
associated tester groups easier.


19
00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.721 line:-1 position:50%
With just one click, you can
now quickly add or remove


20
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,290 line:-1
a tester group to a build


21
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,493 line:-1
directly from the Versions
or Build Groups tab.


22
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:02,162 line:-1
We also heard your feedback
loud and clear,


23
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,798 line:-1
so we made an update
allowing you to transfer apps


24
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,867 line:-1
that use Apple Wallet.


25
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,603 line:-1
And finally, to facilitate
the submission process


26
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,972 line:-1
for in-app events,
custom product pages,


27
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,840 line:-1
and product page optimization,


28
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.044 line:-1 position:50%
we launched the enhanced
App Store submission experience.


29
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,179 line:-1
This is one the biggest
enhancements we've made


30
00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.714 line:-1 position:50%
to the submission workflow,


31
00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:24.184 line:-1 position:50%
so let's explore this together
in a bit more detail.


32
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,054 line:-1
First, you're now able
to group multiple items


33
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,323 line:-1
into a single submission.


34
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,224 line:-1
Additionally --
in most cases --


35
00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:34.861 line:-1 position:50%
you can choose to submit
without a new app version.


36
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.864 line:-1 position:50%
And we introduced
a dedicated App Review page


37
00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.999 line:-1 position:50%
where you can manage
in-progress submissions,


38
00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.535 line:-1 position:50%
communicate with App Review,


39
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,471 line:-1
and even view recently
completed submissions.


40
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,440 line:-1
Let's start by talking
about what it means


41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,242 line:-1
to group items
in a review submission.


42
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,478 line:-1
Say we have a number
of custom product pages


43
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,781 line:-1
or any other review items
we want to publish to the store.


44
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,650 line:-1
Since review items
can only be submitted


45
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.518 line:-1 position:50%
as part of a review submission,


46
00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:01.154 line:-1 position:50%
the first step is
to add them to one.


47
00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.290 line:-1 position:50%
Think of a review submission
as the vehicle


48
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,893 line:-1
that carries review items
to and from App Review.


49
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,397 line:-1
Now, a review submission only
needs one item to be submitted,


50
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,399 line:-1
but the advantage
to grouping several items


51
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,868 line:-1
is they are all reviewed
in context together.


52
00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.871 line:-1 position:50%
This helps ensure a consistent
and efficient review.


53
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,806 line:-1
In fact, all review submissions


54
00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.209 line:-1 position:50%
are typically reviewed
within 24 hours,


55
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,113 line:-1
regardless of the number
or type of review items.


56
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,048 line:1
After review,
each item in the submission


57
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,784 position:50%
will be marked as
accepted or rejected.


58
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,052 line:1
It's very important
to understand


59
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,321 line:1
that no review
items are approved


60
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,591 line:1
until all items in the review
submission are accepted.


61
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,493 line:-1
So let's look at two ways
to move forward


62
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,529 line:-1
with a review submission
that has rejected items.


63
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,832 line:-1
The first option is to edit any
of these rejected review items


64
00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.534 line:-1 position:50%
and then resubmit.


65
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,936 position:50%
If those items
now come back accepted,


66
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,671 position:50%
the review submission
is complete


67
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,839 line:1
and every item is approved


68
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,675 line:1
and able to be published
to the App Store.


69
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,210 line:1
The other option
is to simply remove


70
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,913 position:50%
any rejected items
from the submission.


71
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,515 position:50%
This leaves
the review submission


72
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,083 line:1
with only approved items,


73
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:06,119 line:1
once again completing
the review process.


74
00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.789 line:-1 position:50%
However, keep in mind
that any removed items


75
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,992 line:-1
will need to be resubmitted
as a part of a new submission


76
00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:14.227 line:-1 position:50%
in order to become approved.


77
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,495 line:-1
And before I move on,


78
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,431 line:-1
let me specify that
review submission items


79
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,133 line:-1
can be app versions,
in-app events,


80
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:24,438 line:-1
custom product pages, or
product page optimization tests.


81
00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:26.773 line:-1 position:50%
Now, let's take a look
at how you're able to submit


82
00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.742 line:-1 position:50%
without a new app version.


83
00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:30.944 line:-1 position:50%
To understand how this works,


84
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,379 line:-1
let's discuss
a few more specifics


85
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,714 line:-1
about review submissions.


86
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,486 line:-1
First, each submission
has an associated platform.


87
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,455 line:-1
In addition,
each platform supports


88
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,024 line:-1
a specific set of review items.


89
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,526 position:50%
Although, as you can see,
most items are reviewed


90
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,930 position:50%
and grouped as part
of an iOS submission.


91
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.933 line:-1 position:50%
And lastly, you can have one
in-progress review submission


92
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,367 line:-1
per platform.


93
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,503 line:-1
In this example,
you can see we're working


94
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,272 line:-1
towards submitting all three
versions of our app.


95
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,341 line:-1
But, let's go ahead
and take a closer look


96
00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:04.177 line:-1 position:50%
at the iOS review submission.


97
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,780 line:-1
App Review reviews
all items in a submission


98
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,650 line:-1
against an app version to ensure
everything is consistent.


99
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.752 line:-1 position:50%
If there's an app version
in the submission,


100
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,088 line:-1
that becomes the version
used for review.


101
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,590 line:-1
But like I mentioned earlier,


102
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.427 line:-1 position:50%
you can submit without adding a
new version to your submission.


103
00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.929 line:-1 position:50%
To do this requires
a previously approved version


104
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,030 line:-1
of your app.


105
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,565 line:-1
Of course,
once submitted,


106
00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:28.835 line:-1 position:50%
items will be reviewed
against this version.


107
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,171 line:-1
This means you're able
to submit in-app events,


108
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:34.541 line:-1 position:50%
custom product pages and
product page optimization tests


109
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:37.511 line:-1 position:50%
anytime after your first
iOS version is approved,


110
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.447 line:-1 position:50%
without needing
a new app binary.


111
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,016 line:-1
So now that I've explained
how this experience works,


112
00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.317 line:-1 position:50%
let me show you
where the dedicated


113
00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:47.821 line:-1 position:50%
App Review submission page
lives in App Store Connect.


114
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.856 line:-1 position:50%
Once you've logged in
and selected an app,


115
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,326 line:-1
click the App Review link
on the left nav menu.


116
00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.629 line:-1 position:50%
This is the App Review page


117
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.532 line:-1 position:50%
where you can manage
your entire review workflow.


118
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,734 line:-1
Here, you can see an overview
of your submissions


119
00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:04.171 line:-1 position:50%
and click into any of them
for a more detailed look.


120
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,873 line:-1
Now obviously,
using the web UI is great,


121
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,775 line:-1
but wouldn't it be nice
to submit and track


122
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,378 line:-1
submission status on the go?


123
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,746 line:-1
That's why we're excited
to share


124
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,915 line:-1
that we've brought the
enhanced submission experience


125
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:20,520 line:-1
to App Store Connect on iPadOS
and iOS with this week's update.


126
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,888 line:-1
You'll now be able to submit


127
00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:24.457 line:-1 position:50%
any of your Ready for Review
submissions to App Review


128
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,327 line:-1
from anywhere,
with just one tap.


129
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,628 line:-1
Once submitted,


130
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,965 line:-1
you can track the progress
of your review submissions.


131
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,868 line:-1
And you can opt in
to receive timely notifications


132
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,370 line:-1
about status updates


133
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.608 line:-1 position:50%
as well as manage your
submission by removing items,


134
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:46,213 line:-1
viewing rejection reasons,
and replying to App Review.


135
00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:48.949 line:-1 position:50%
So that's the enhanced
App Store submission experience,


136
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,951 line:-1
available now
on App Store Connect


137
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:53.853 line:-1 position:50%
for iPadOS and iOS.


138
00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.388 line:-1 position:50%
Let's shift gears a bit
and focus on


139
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,224 line:-1
the App Store Connect API


140
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,559 line:-1
which represents a great way
for you to customize


141
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,928 line:-1
and automate your app workflows.


142
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,664 line:-1
Best of all, we're always
working to add new capabilities


143
00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.633 line:-1 position:50%
to the API.


144
00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:10.370 line:-1 position:50%
Last year, we added support
for App Clips, Xcode Cloud,


145
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,772 line:-1
in-app events,
custom product pages,


146
00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:14.641 line:-1 position:50%
product page optimization,


147
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,043 line:-1
and even the enhanced App Store
submission experience


148
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,511 line:-1
I just described.


149
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,413 line:-1
And this year is no different.


150
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,283 line:-1
With our huge 2.0 release
coming this summer,


151
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,685 line:-1
we're expanding the number
of resources in the API


152
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,721 line:-1
by 60 percent.


153
00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:28.955 line:-1 position:50%
In this summer's release,


154
00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.790 line:-1 position:50%
we're adding some
great new functionality


155
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,859 line:-1
that has been heavily requested.


156
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,562 line:-1
Beginning with
a comprehensive set of APIs


157
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,664 line:-1
to manage your entire
in-app purchase


158
00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:39.933 line:-1 position:50%
and subscription lifecycle.


159
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,935 line:-1
We started by breaking
subscriptions


160
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,770 line:-1
into their own resource


161
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,607 line:-1
and giving you full control
to create, edit, or delete


162
00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:50.710 line:-1 position:50%
any of your in-app purchases
or subscriptions.


163
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,881 line:-1
You'll also be able to manage
pricing, submit for review,


164
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,851 line:-1
and create special offers
and promo codes.


165
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,653 line:-1
We can't wait to see
how you take advantage


166
00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:02.122 line:-1 position:50%
of this new opportunity
to automate your in-app purchase


167
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,491 line:-1
and subscription workflows.


168
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:05.759 line:-1 position:50%
We're also adding the ability


169
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.862 line:-1 position:50%
to fetch and respond
to your app's customer reviews.


170
00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:10.697 line:-1 position:50%
The goal here
is to allow you to build


171
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:14,267 line:-1
some great custom workflows
around customer interaction.


172
00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.536 line:-1 position:50%
And lastly, we're adding
additional reporting data


173
00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:19.439 line:-1 position:50%
to the power and performance
metrics and diagnostics APIs


174
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,141 line:-1
for app hangs.


175
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,576 line:-1
Identifying and eliminating
hangs in your app


176
00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.612 line:-1 position:50%
is a great way
to increase performance


177
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,014 line:-1
and improve user experience.


178
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,317 line:-1
But until now,
you could only view metrics


179
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,186 line:-1
like your app's hang rate
through the API.


180
00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:34.988 line:-1 position:50%
That changes this summer
as we're adding


181
00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:38.325 line:-1 position:50%
a new diagnostic type
for app hangs.


182
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,626 line:-1
You'll be able use this type


183
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,362 line:-1
with the existing
diagnostic signatures resource


184
00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:43.863 line:-1 position:50%
to discover the places
in your app


185
00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:46.032 line:-1 position:50%
that contribute most to hangs.


186
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,001 line:-1
Not only that,
but you'll also be able to see


187
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,470 line:-1
detailed stack traces
for these hang signatures


188
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,707 line:-1
through the diagnostic logs
relationship.


189
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,842 line:1
I've just barely scratched
the surface here,


190
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,178 line:1
so if you'd like to learn more
about how these APIs work


191
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,914 line:1
or how to use this data
to discover additional insights


192
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,282 position:50%
into your app's behavior,


193
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,085 line:1
definitely check out
these two related sessions.


194
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,722 line:-1
Overall, the App Store Connect
API 2.0 release


195
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,757 line:-1
represents a major milestone.


196
00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:14.361 line:-1 position:50%
After four years of development,
we've fully embraced REST APIs


197
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:17.097 line:-1 position:50%
as the future of
App Store Connect automation.


198
00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:19.432 line:-1 position:50%
As a result,
we'll begin to decommission


199
00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.735 line:-1 position:50%
the XML feed this fall.


200
00:08:21.735 --> 00:08:25.171 line:-1 position:50%
Therefore, we highly encourage
you to align your integration


201
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:28.007 line:-1 position:50%
with the App Store Connect API
moving forward.


202
00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:30.443 line:-1 position:50%
In summary, we recommend
taking full advantage


203
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,512 line:-1
of the enhanced App Store
submission experience


204
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,615 line:-1
in order streamline
your review process.


205
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,184 line:-1
Also, be sure to download
the latest release


206
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,221 line:-1
of App Store Connect
for iOS and iPadOS,


207
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,857 line:-1
which adds support for the
enhanced submission experience


208
00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.393 line:-1 position:50%
and several other updates.


209
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,162 line:-1
And finally, we're adding
a bunch of new capabilities


210
00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:50.730 line:-1 position:50%
to the App Store Connect API


211
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,400 line:-1
with the 2.0 release
this summer.


212
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.503 line:-1 position:50%
We strongly suggest working
to integrate with our API,


213
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:59,305 line:-1
especially as we begin
to decommission the XML feed


214
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,040 line:-1
later this fall.


215
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,209 line:-1
As always, we look forward
to hearing your feedback


216
00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:06.379 line:-1 position:50%
and hope you have a great WWDC!


217
00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:07.881 line:-1 position:50%
Thanks for watching.
