Welcome to "Meet WeatherKit"
at WWDC22.


5
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,182
My name is Novall,


6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,885
and I'm an engineer
on the Weather team.


7
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,721
We rely on weather data
day in and day out,


8
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:23,557
and where we get
this information is important.


9
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,459
From checking the weather
on your Apple Watch


10
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,094
so you know to bring
an umbrella with you


11
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,329
before you head out the door,


12
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,733
to sustainable agriculture
where predicting rain and frost


13
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,836
can help farmers
plan crop rotation,


14
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,573
to staying safe and prepared
for winter storm travel --


15
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:42,175
weather impacts everyone.


16
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,778
Accurate weather data
has become even more critical


17
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:48,315
in today's world affected
by our changing climate.


18
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,517
And having access
to accurate forecasts


19
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,287
is important now more than ever,


20
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,923
which is why
we created WeatherKit.


21
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:59,693
WeatherKit is powered by the
all-new Apple Weather Service,


22
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,863
a world-class
global weather forecast.


23
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,832
It uses high-resolution
weather models


24
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,802
and machine learning
and prediction algorithms


25
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,038
to give you hyperlocal
weather forecasts


26
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:13,307
around the globe.


27
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:16,944
With Apple Weather Service,
we have access to a lot of data,


28
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:20,948
and all of this is available
to you through WeatherKit.


29
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:24,284
Accurate weather data
requires location information.


30
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:28,522
And keeping that data private
is a shared responsibility.


31
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,824
In keeping with
our commitment to privacy,


32
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,027
WeatherKit is designed
to give hyperlocal forecasts


33
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,130
without compromising
user information.


34
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,600
Location is used only
to provide weather forecasts


35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,768
and is not associated


36
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,105
with any personally
identifying information


37
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,008
and is never shared or sold.


38
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,943
With WeatherKit,
we've made it easy for you


39
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,279
to protect user privacy.


40
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,515
Today I will be diving into
more detail about WeatherKit


41
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,919
so you can get the most
out of our new API.


42
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,887
First, I'll cover
the available data sets


43
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,356
we offer through WeatherKit,


44
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:05,525
backed by our own
Apple Weather Service.


45
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,362
Next, I'll show you how
to request weather information


46
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,330
using the WeatherKit framework


47
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,133
and a REST API designed
so you can get weather data


48
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,435
on any platform.


49
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,370
And finally,


50
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,839
I'll cover some additional
implementation requirements


51
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,341
and best practices.


52
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:25,746
Let me start with an overview of
the available weather data sets.


53
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:29,983
As I mentioned, you have access
to a lot of data in WeatherKit.


54
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,186
So let's talk about
each data set.


55
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,156
The current weather data set
describes the "now" conditions


56
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,658
at the requested location.


57
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,794
It represents
a single point in time


58
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:46,333
and includes conditions like
UV index, temperature, and wind.


59
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,668
The minute forecast
contains minute-by-minute


60
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,138
precipitation conditions
for the next hour,


61
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,073
where available.


62
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,475
This data set is useful
for deciding whether or not


63
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,845
to bring an umbrella with you
as you walk out the door.


64
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,281
The hourly forecast
is a collection of forecasts


65
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,183
starting on the current hour


66
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,154
and provides data
for up to 240 hours.


67
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,956
Each hour in the hourly forecast
includes conditions


68
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:15,362
like humidity, visibility,
pressure, and dew point.


69
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,866
The daily forecast contains a
forecast collection of 10 days.


70
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,468
Each day in the daily forecast


71
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,371
provides information
about the entire day,


72
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,540
like the high
and low temperature,


73
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,042
sunrise, and sunset.


74
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,445
Weather alerts contains
severe weather warnings


75
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,247
issued for
the requested location.


76
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,017
This data set contains
important information


77
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:41,455
to keep your users safe,
informed, and prepared.


78
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:45,258
And finally, historical weather
provides saved weather forecasts


79
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,626
from the past,


80
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,529
so you can see trends
in weather data.


81
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,164
You can access historical data


82
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,667
by specifying
a start and end date


83
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,770
to the hourly
and daily requests.


84
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,773
This gives you access
to a lot of data.


85
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:03,009
We think there are a lot
of important and impactful ways


86
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,779
you can use historical weather.


87
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,282
Now that you've seen all of
the rich weather data available,


88
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,585
I'll walk you through
how to request this weather data


89
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,821
with the WeatherKit APIs.


90
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,391
Apple Weather data is available
through both a native framework


91
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,561
and a set of REST APIs.


92
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,697
First, let me show you
how easy it is


93
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,200
to access weather data
with our Swift framework.


94
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,603
All it takes
is a few lines of code.


95
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,540
And with Swift Concurrency,
requesting weather is simple.


96
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,777
First, you'll import WeatherKit
and CoreLocation.


97
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,046
Then you'll create
a weatherService object,


98
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,383
as your entry point
for the Weather Service.


99
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,719
You'll create a CLLocation
with coordinates


100
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,288
for your location of interest.


101
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,225
Here, I'm using my hometown
of Syracuse, New York.


102
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,662
Then you’ll call weather(for:)
on the weatherService instance


103
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:59,332
and pass in the location
created above.


104
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,767
When the call completes,


105
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,171
you can access the relevant data
you need for your app,


106
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:08,575
like the current temperature
and UV Index in this example.


107
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,410
Now that I've shown you
how easy it is


108
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,779
to request weather data
with Swift,


109
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,681
let me take you through
another example


110
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,485
I'm using a travel app
that I'm building in SwiftUI.


111
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,520
You can grab the completed
project from the link


112
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,789
associated with this session.


113
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,058
Since I'm really looking forward
to traveling again,


114
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,093
I've decided to create
a flight planner app


115
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,663
to plan my next trip.


116
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,866
I've already created the logic
for my flight itinerary,


117
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,768
but when I tap on each
of the flights in my trip,


118
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,337
I want to show columns
containing the condition,


119
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:43,109
precipitation, wind, and
temperature at each destination.


120
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,378
First step is to enable
WeatherKit.


121
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,348
Register the App ID
in the Developer Portal,


122
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,084
then select the Capability
and App Services t  abs


123
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,386
to enable WeatherKit.


124
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,755
Then in Xcode,
add the WeatherKit capability


125
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,958
to the project.


126
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,626
With that prep out of the way,


127
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,861
let me walk through how
I'll get the weather data


128
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,764
for each of these locations.


129
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,100
Here I have an Airport struct
already set up


130
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,868
that contains
the latitude and longitude


131
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,438
of my destination airports.


132
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,374
I'll get the hourly forecast
by calling weather(for:)


133
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,609
on our shared weather service


134
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,979
and then pass in
our airport location.


135
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,751
Because I just want
a subset of data,


136
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,787
I've also specified to include
the hourly forecast


137
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,823
in the request.


138
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,726
Now, I'll build and run my app.


139
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,565
Now I can see
my custom view updated


140
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,601
to display the conditions
at each airport.


141
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,603
The next thing I need to do
while building this app


142
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:48,341
is to display attribution
for the data sources in my app.


143
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,580
First, I'll get
the attribution URL from


144
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,083
the attribution.legalPageURL
property.


145
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,586
This is a link to
the legal attribution page


146
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,388
that contains
copyright information


147
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,723
about the weather data sources.


148
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,425
I'll also need to get the URL


149
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,494
for the combined
Apple Weather mark.


150
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,100
It's available in both light
and dark variants,


151
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,336
so I'll check the
colorScheme environment value


152
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,905
to find out if the SwiftUI view
is currently displaying


153
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:22,208
in light or dark appearance.


154
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,811
Finally,
I'll build and run again.


155
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,285
Note that the Apple Weather mark
and attribution link


156
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,256
opens in an
SFSafariViewController.


157
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,058
That's all it takes
to get the weather


158
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,760
for our flight planner app,
and there are so many ways


159
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,263
you can use the WeatherKit API
to add weather data


160
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,265
to your apps.


161
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,134
But that was only
the native framework.


162
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,037
The REST API provides
the same rich weather data


163
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,208
as the Swift framework
and can be used on any platform.


164
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,678
In this example, I'm showing how
you can request weather alerts


165
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:02,382
from the weatherkit.apple.com
endpoint.


166
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,651
First, you request
an auth token.


167
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,020
I'll discuss that more in a bit.


168
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,457
Then, to get the weather object,
you first create a URL


169
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:14,494
indicating the desired weather
data set for a given location.


170
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,629
Be sure to set
the appropriate language


171
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,032
for a localized response.


172
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,501
Then, provide
the latitude and longitude


173
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,037
of the location of interest.


174
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,473
Indicate the desired data set.


175
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:29,242
You may notice this parameter
is plural so you can request


176
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:33,313
several at once by separating
each with a comma.


177
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,916
And finally, the country code
for the requested location.


178
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,185
But note, the country code
is only required


179
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,156
if you're requesting
the weather alerts data set.


180
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,724
Next, you'll fetch
the weather data


181
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,328
using the URL and your auth
token from above,


182
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,231
converting the results to JSON.


183
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,366
With that, you can access
the weather alerts


184
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,668
and their details.


185
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,538
So again, another example
of how easy it is


186
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,942
for you to access weather data,
only this time through REST.


187
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,745
To go into more depth
about the setup you need,


188
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,815
let's revisit auth.


189
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,517
For the WeatherKit REST API,


190
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:14,821
there are a few additional steps
to handle authentication.


191
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,956
In the Developer Portal,
you'll enable access


192
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:20,226
for WeatherKit requests by
creating an authentication key


193
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,531
enabled for WeatherKit
and an associated services ID.


194
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,999
The private key can be created


195
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:29,269
in the Keys section
of the Developer Portal.


196
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,172
WeatherKit requires tokens
to validate authorization


197
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,706
on each request.


198
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,242
So on your server,
you'll deploy a token service


199
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:40,814
for creating a signed JSON web
token using your private key.


200
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,883
For those familiar with JSON
web token authentication,


201
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,853
this is a fairly standard
authorization flow,


202
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,021
but let me share some details


203
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,291
in case this is your first time
working with it.


204
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,592
To generate a signed token


205
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,762
you'll create the header
containing the fields and values


206
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:59,165
described in the
developer documentation.


207
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,068
Then create the payload
containing the information


208
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:06,105
specific to the WeatherKit
REST API and your application,


209
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,808
including items such
as the issuer, subject,


210
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,311
and expiration time.


211
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,246
And finally,
you'll sign the token


212
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:17,617
for use with a subsequent call
to the WeatherKit REST API.


213
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,086
Going back to
my weather alerts example,


214
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:24,190
here's where you'll request the
token from your signing service,


215
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,593
and add the token
to the Authorization header


216
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:31,030
of your HTTP request
for weather data.


217
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,633
So that's
the WeatherKit REST API.


218
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,269
One of two great ways
for you to access weather data


219
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,438
from the Apple Weather Service.


220
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,007
Lastly, I'll cover a few
additional requirements


221
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,110
for publishing on the App Store
or before you go live


222
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,914
on any platform
using the REST API.


223
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,049
Each of these requirements
apply regardless


224
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:54,387
of whether you're using
the native Swift or REST APIs.


225
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,090
The first requirement
is attribution.


226
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,858
As you saw in my demo,
you'll get a link


227
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,528
from our Attribution API
which you'll need to display


228
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,163
in your native or web app.


229
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,233
The second requirement
is an attribution logo.


230
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,303
The WeatherKit API
makes this easy and convenient


231
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:15,041
by providing the image assets
you need to display in your app.


232
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,644
And finally, if you'll be
displaying weather alerts,


233
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,512
you'll also need to link
to an event page


234
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,848
provided in the response.


235
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,284
So that's how easy it is
to prepare your app


236
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,554
for publication
on the App Store or the web.


237
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:28,888
So that's WeatherKit --


238
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,559
hyperlocal forecasts powered
the Apple Weather Service


239
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,663
accessible through our Swift
framework and our REST API.


240
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,731
Both open up a world
of possibilities


241
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,934
for you to use weather data
in your apps,


242
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,670
on any platform or device.


243
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,805
We hope you enjoyed
this session.


244
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,741
Besides checking out the links
associated with this session,


245
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,311

and download the project.


246
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,646
And of course,
we'd love your feedback.


247
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,116
We can't wait to see all of
the creative and impactful ways


248
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,818
