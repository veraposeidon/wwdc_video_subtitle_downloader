3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,044 line:-1
Halden: Hello, I'm Halden.


4
00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.479 line:-1 align:center
Lilian: And I'm Lilian.


5
00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:16.250 line:-2 align:center
Halden: Today, we're going to show you
how to design an effective chart.


6
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:19,720 line:-2
Lilian: Charts are powerful tools
for making your apps more engaging


7
00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.555 line:-1 align:center
and informative.


8
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:25,192 line:-2
People can use charts of
weather forecasts to make plans,


9
00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.028 line:-1 align:center
stock prices to make financial decisions,


10
00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:32.766 line:-2 align:center
and fitness data to reflect
on their activities and set new goals.


11
00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.701 line:-1 align:center
Halden: When you design a chart in an app,


12
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,471 line:-2
you first need to design
the app's experience.


13
00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:41.041 line:-2 align:center
By identifying your app's needs,
you can decide when to use charts,


14
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:44,645 line:-2
how to use charts,
and what design system will unify them.


15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,683 align:center
To learn about this important first step
of the design process,


16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:54,054 align:center
see this year's talk called
"Design app experiences with charts".


17
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:58,292 line:-2
Lilian: In this talk, we'll dive into
the next part of the design process:


18
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,527 line:-1
how to design a chart.


19
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,398 line:-2
In particular,
designing an effective chart,


20
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,435 line:-2
which means a chart that's focused on
what you want to communicate,


21
00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:12.339 line:-2 align:center
approachable, and accessible
for people with disabilities.


22
00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:16.476 line:-2 align:center
To do that, we'll walk through
the design of a chart in an app for


23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,213 line:-2
a food truck
selling international pancakes


24
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,282 line:-1
in San Francisco and Cupertino.


25
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,652 line:-2
This finished app has
an entire system of charts


26
00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:28.188 line:-1 align:center
to help plan and manage pancake sales.


27
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:31,658 line:-2
Today, we'll focus on how to design
one of these charts,


28
00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:35.462 line:-2 align:center
which visualizes pancake sales
over the last 30 days.


29
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,832 line:-2
Halden: Good chart design begins
with identifying the chart's goal.


30
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.635 line:-2 align:center
For this page in our app,
our goal was communicating:


31
00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:44.304 line:-2 align:center
"how were pancake sales
in the last 30 days?"


32
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,441 line:-1
Goals like this can go in many directions.


33
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,278 line:-2
It might be useful for our food truck
owners to see the pattern of recent sales


34
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,081 line:-2
to understand how sales have fluctuated
or their range,


35
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,017 line:-2
to get an idea of how big
these fluctuations were.


36
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.522 line:-2 align:center
Identifying values could be useful
to examine specific days.


37
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:06,126 line:-2
Other insights of interest
could be maximum sales, outlier days,


38
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.429 line:-2 align:center
or comparisons between days of the week
or location.


39
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,598 line:-1
The list can go on and on.


40
00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:15.269 line:-2 align:center
Which of these insights are most important
for our food truck owners?


41
00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:18.739 line:-2 align:center
An effective chart focuses on
a few key pieces of information.


42
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,308 line:-1
Design charts with intention.


43
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,177 line:-1
With regards to pancake sales,


44
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,014 line:-2
our food truck owners primarily want to
examine how their sales fared over time


45
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,416 line:-1
and on specific days.


46
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,719 line:-2
That means we'll want to focus
on communicating pattern,


47
00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:35.722 line:-1 align:center
range, and values.


48
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:39,326 line:-2
How did we get from
these three priorities to this chart?


49
00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.063 line:-2 align:center
Let's walk through the design process
step by step.


50
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:47,134 line:-2
Lilian:
Our design process involves five topics.


51
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.003 line:-2 align:center
Marks, which are a chart's
visual building blocks,


52
00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:52.272 line:-1 align:center
like the bars in a bar chart.


53
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:55,509 line:-1
Axes, to provide framing for these marks.


54
00:02:55,542 --> 00:03:00,280 line:-2
Descriptions, which make charts more
approachable and easy to interpret.


55
00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:03.684 line:-2 align:center
Interaction,
which empowers deeper exploration of data


56
00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:06.086 line:-1 align:center
and is critical to accessibility.


57
00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.622 line:-1 align:center
And color, which adds personality,


58
00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.824 line:-1 align:center
and, as we'll show with a second chart,


59
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,527 line:-1
can also enhance clarity.


60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,097 line:-2
Halden: Our first step is to figure out
what kind of form we want for our chart,


61
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,868 line:-2
using the visual building block
of charts called marks.


62
00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:23.036 line:-1 align:center
A mark is the bar in a bar chart,


63
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,740 line:-2
the line in a line chart,
and the point in a scatterplot.


64
00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:30.444 line:-2 align:center
They're the visual elements
that represent items in data.


65
00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:32.246 line:-1 align:center
There are many kinds of marks,


66
00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:33.580 line:-1 align:center
and with any one mark,


67
00:03:33.614 --> 00:03:37.651 line:-2 align:center
you have a rich variety of ways
to express data.


68
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,953 line:-1
Take bars, for example.


69
00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:44.925 line:-2 align:center
You can line them up
to represent data's change over time.


70
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,394 line:-1
You can stack them to show proportions:


71
00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:51.064 line:-2 align:center
how different categories add up
to a total.


72
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,001 line:-2
Or you can put them side by side
to compare values


73
00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:56.870 line:-1 align:center
between different categories.


74
00:03:56.904 --> 00:04:01.975 line:-2 align:center
These are just a few examples of the many
rich ways you can express data with marks.


75
00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.913 line:-1 align:center
So what options make sense for our chart?


76
00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:10.384 line:-2 align:center
When it comes to marks, you need
to design for your goals and data.


77
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,954 line:-2
As we decided earlier,
our chart should focus on three insights


78
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,857 line:-1
about pancake sales in the last 30 days:


79
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.394 line:-1 align:center
pattern, range, and individual values.


80
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:24,431 line:-2
As we choose our mark,
we'll pay close attention to pattern.


81
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,668 line:-2
It would be useful for our food truck
owners to see any fluctuations


82
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,003 line:-1
or trajectories in their sales.


83
00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:32.472 line:-2 align:center
We'll start with time
on the horizontal axis


84
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,175 line:-1
and pancake sales on the vertical axis.


85
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,979 line:-2
These axes are incomplete;
we'll fill them in later.


86
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:44,418 line:-2
One option for a mark is to use points
to represent each day of pancake sales.


87
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:48.856 line:-2 align:center
When we envision nice smooth data for
the chart like this, points look great!


88
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,526 line:-1
But real data is rarely this neat.


89
00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.195 line:-2 align:center
With realistic data,
we can see that using points


90
00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.698 line:-2 align:center
makes it difficult
to make out any pattern.


91
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,668 line:-2
It's important to test your designs
with real data early.


92
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,638 line:-2
While point marks are a great
at revealing some insights,


93
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,641 line:-2
such as identifying outliers
or clusters in data,


94
00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:11.211 line:-1 align:center
our needs call for something else.


95
00:05:11.245 --> 00:05:13.514 line:-2 align:center
To make the pattern of sales
easier to see,


96
00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:16.850 line:-2 align:center
we can connect sales counts
by using a line mark.


97
00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:19.720 line:-2 align:center
Lines are great
at representing rates of change.


98
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,090 line:-1
Here, patterns and trajectories are clear.


99
00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:24.691 line:-1 align:center
But what if, in one month,


100
00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:28.562 line:-2 align:center
our food truck needed to close
for five alternating days?


101
00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:32.132 line:-2 align:center
In this situation,
the pattern of sales becomes less clear


102
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.701 line:-2 align:center
because the segments connecting
far-apart values


103
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,738 line:-2
become more prominent
than the values themselves.


104
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:42.376 line:-2 align:center
Remember to design for a variety
of scenarios in your data.


105
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.445 line:-2 align:center
Bar marks are a more flexible option
for our chart.


106
00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.049 line:-2 align:center
Here, zeros are visible
without creating a distraction.


107
00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:51.418 line:-1 align:center
This chart is also intuitive to read:


108
00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.687 line:-1 align:center
more white means more sales.


109
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.522 line:-1 align:center
Since sales are cumulative,


110
00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:58.125 line:-2 align:center
the visual weight of all the bars
corresponds directly


111
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,228 line:-2
to the number of sales made
in the last 30 days.


112
00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:04.131 line:-1 align:center
Lilian: Great!


113
00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:08.235 line:-2 align:center
We've chosen a mark that makes the pattern
of pancake sales visually apparent.


114
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:12,306 line:-2
But we also need to follow
an important tenant of accessible design:


115
00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.675 line:-1 align:center
for all information you show visually,


116
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,779 line:-2
you also need to design
how to represent it non-visually.


117
00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:22.349 line:-2 align:center
In other words,
you need to make sure these marks


118
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:27,120 line:-2
and the information they represent
are also accessible with VoiceOver.


119
00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:29.223 line:-1 align:center
VoiceOver is a screen reader.


120
00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:33.460 line:-2 align:center
It lets people read information on
their screen through Braille or speech


121
00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:37.564 line:-2 align:center
so people who are blind and others
can use apps without needing to see.


122
00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:42.102 line:-1 align:center
VoiceOver: 1,234 pancakes.


123
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,605 line:-2
Lilian: You can use VoiceOver
to navigate content,


124
00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:46.206 line:-1 align:center
like the elements on a chart.


125
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,676 line:-2
VoiceOver: May 8th.
54 pancakes.


126
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,713 line:-1
May 9th. 36 pancakes.


127
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,749 line:-1
One year, button two of two.


128
00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:58.852 line:-1 align:center
Lilian: You can also use it to interact.


129
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,955 line:-2
VoiceOver:
Selected: one year, two of two.


130
00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:05.592 line:-2 align:center
Lilian: And through a feature
called audio graphs...


131
00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:07.794 line:-1 align:center
VoiceOver: Audio graph.


132
00:07:07.828 --> 00:07:10.797 line:-1 align:center
Lilian: Play a sonification of the chart


133
00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:13.100 line:-1 align:center
VoiceOver: Play audio graph.


134
00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:18.138 line:-1 align:center
[phone chiming]


135
00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:22.075 line:-1 align:center
Complete.


136
00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:25.412 line:-2 align:center
Lilian: To make your chart's marks
non-visually accessible,


137
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:30,384 line:-2
you need to 1. design how VoiceOver
will navigate over data values,


138
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,587 line:-1
and 2. use audio graphs.


139
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.591 line:-2 align:center
Conveniently, charts implemented
with the Swift Charts API


140
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,962 line:-2
automatically include customizable
accessibility labels for marks


141
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,199 line:-1
and an implementation of audio graphs.


142
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,968 align:center
To learn more about audio graphs
and Swift Charts,


143
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,270 align:center
check out developer documentation,


144
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,707 line:0
last year's talk "Bring accessibility
to charts in your app",


145
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,511 line:0
and this year's talk,
"Hello Swift Charts".


146
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,312 line:-1
Nice!


147
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,647 line:-2
We've designed our marks
for our goals and data,


148
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,650 line:-1
and made them accessible in VoiceOver.


149
00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:07.354 line:-2 align:center
With our decisions,
we addressed one part of the question,


150
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,923 line:-2
"how were pancake sales
over the last 30 days?"


151
00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:12.326 line:-1 align:center
Specifically, their pattern.


152
00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:17.231 line:-2 align:center
Now our food truck owners can see
recent fluctuations in their sales.


153
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:20,200 line:-2
But what about the range
of these fluctuations,


154
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:23,103 line:-1
and values on specific days?


155
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,339 line:-1
Halden: For that, we'll design axes.


156
00:08:25.372 --> 00:08:29.409 line:-2 align:center
Axes frame marks to provide references
for their values.


157
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:32,713 line:-2
For example,
in our chart of pancake sales,


158
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,849 line:-2
when we label the horizontal axis
with the start and end dates,


159
00:08:35.883 --> 00:08:41.522 line:-2 align:center
it becomes clear that our chart shows
the 30 days from May 8th to June 6th.


160
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,357 line:-1
What about the vertical axis?


161
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.327 line:-2 align:center
The values here are entirely dependent
on the sales of the food truck.


162
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:50.898 line:-2 align:center
With axes like this,
it's important to consider the range.


163
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:53.867 line:-1 align:center
A range can be either fixed or dynamic.


164
00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:56.703 line:-2 align:center
An example of a fixed range
is the vertical axis


165
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,872 line:-1
of the battery chart in the Settings app.


166
00:08:58.906 --> 00:09:03.410 line:-2 align:center
We know that the battery level
will always go from 0 to 100%.


167
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:07,214 line:-2
Fixing the vertical axis to this range
helps us see, at a glance,


168
00:09:07.247 --> 00:09:11.151 line:-2 align:center
when the battery is full, empty,
or somewhere in between.


169
00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:14.488 line:-2 align:center
While it'd be confusing to change
the vertical axis range for this chart,


170
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:16.857 line:-1 align:center
it can be necessary for others.


171
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,426 line:-2
Consider the step count chart
in the Health app,


172
00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:21.562 line:-1 align:center
which uses a dynamic range.


173
00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:23.830 line:-1 align:center
There is no fixed maximum step count,


174
00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:28.402 line:-2 align:center
so it makes sense to dynamically adapt
the vertical axis range to fit the data.


175
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,171 line:-2
This way,
even when the step counts are low,


176
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:34,241 line:-2
the bars can make full use of
the vertical space available,


177
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,978 line:-1
making fluctuations easier to see.


178
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:41.114 line:-2 align:center
Let's return to our chart
on pancake sales.


179
00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:45.819 line:-2 align:center
As with steps, there is no limit to how
many pancakes the food trucks will sell.


180
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:49,189 line:-2
So let's use a dynamic range
to automatically adapt


181
00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:52.359 line:-2 align:center
the upper bound
of our vertical axis to our data.


182
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,696 line:-2
Notice how we still fix
the lower bound to 0.


183
00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:59.066 line:-2 align:center
Doing so is generally a good idea
when using bar marks


184
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,835 line:-2
as it keeps the heights
of the bars meaningful.


185
00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:06.740 line:-2 align:center
This way, a bar that's twice as tall
as another has twice as many sales.


186
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:10.444 line:-2 align:center
While labels for the lower
and upper bounds of each axis are helpful,


187
00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:15.115 line:-2 align:center
we still need more structure to interpret
sales in the middle of the chart.


188
00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:17.084 line:-1 align:center
That leads to our next concept.


189
00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:21.655 line:-2 align:center
We need to tailor the density
of our axis grid lines and labels.


190
00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:25.259 line:-2 align:center
Grid lines give you reference points
to estimate the values of marks.


191
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:30,230 line:-2
The more grid lines you have,
the easier it is to estimate these values.


192
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:33,166 line:-2
Some charts don't need grid lines
and labels at all,


193
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,636 line:-2
such as this trend platter
in the Health app.


194
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,573 line:-2
These charts tend to be sneak peeks
of larger charts in another view,


195
00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:42.776 line:-2 align:center
so an idea of the data's pattern
is all you need.


196
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,579 line:-2
Grid lines and labels
would add distraction.


197
00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:48.415 line:-2 align:center
Grid lines and labels appear
in the follow-up detailed chart,


198
00:10:48.448 --> 00:10:51.919 line:-2 align:center
where you may want to analyze values
more precisely.


199
00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:54.288 line:-2 align:center
Earlier, we pointed out
that our food truck owners


200
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:58.325 line:-2 align:center
want to examine the range
and values of their sales.


201
00:10:58.358 --> 00:11:01.328 line:-2 align:center
Right now,
we have two horizontal grid lines:


202
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:06,233 line:-2
one at zero and another at roughly the
maximum number of sales for the month,


203
00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:10.838 line:-2 align:center
which is too few for estimating the range
of sales in the middle of the chart.


204
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:15,108 line:-2
At the same time, too many grid lines
and labels can be distracting.


205
00:11:15.142 --> 00:11:19.913 line:-2 align:center
Here, having seven horizontal grid lines
might be overwhelming.


206
00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:23.016 line:-2 align:center
Balance these factors to choose
the appropriate density.


207
00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.586 line:-1 align:center
For our chart's context and intended use,


208
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,689 line:-2
it's more effective to use around
four horizontal grid lines


209
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:32,559 line:-2
and adjust
as the range of the axis changes.


210
00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:35.195 line:-2 align:center
Note that as we place
these grid lines and labels,


211
00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:38.298 line:-2 align:center
we use intuitive values
to make the chart approachableâ€“


212
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:41,535 line:-1
in this case, multiples of 20.


213
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:46,607 line:-2
In the same way, it's intuitive for people
to read time in steps of seven days,


214
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.944 line:-2 align:center
which gives us
five grid lines for a 30-day period.


215
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:54,114 line:-2
So we've designed our axes
by considering their range


216
00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:56.717 line:-2 align:center
and tailoring the density of grid lines
and labels.


217
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,853 line:-2
We've gone a long way towards
making our chart effective,


218
00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:02.022 line:-1 align:center
but charts are complex visual elements,


219
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:05.192 line:-2 align:center
and our example still needs work
before it's approachable.


220
00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.828 line:-2 align:center
How can we convey the meaning
behind the marks and axes


221
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,831 line:-1
in a way that's quick and intuitive?


222
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:14,301 line:-2
Lilian: That brings us
to our next topic: descriptions.


223
00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:17.471 line:-2 align:center
Descriptions are important
for framing the intent of our chart


224
00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:20.207 line:-1 align:center
and making it approachable and accessible.


225
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,410 line:-2
Use descriptions,
or text preceding the chart,


226
00:12:23.443 --> 00:12:26.947 line:-2 align:center
to provide context to make
the chart more approachable.


227
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.319 line:-2 align:center
They can make it clear that our chart is
about pancake sales in the last 30 days.


228
00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:34.688 line:-2 align:center
This text can be brief
and should be a part of


229
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,790 line:-1
the user interface around a chart.


230
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,593 line:-2
When we look at this chart
in the UI of our app,


231
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:43,864 line:-2
the screen's title "Total Sales"
already gives some context,


232
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:47,134 line:-2
and the label on the segmented control
that says "30 Days"


233
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,137 line:-1
quickly establishes our time range.


234
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.772 line:-1 align:center
That's a start.


235
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:56,176 line:-2
Something else we need to clarify
is what the vertical axis is showing.


236
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.345 line:-1 align:center
Are we looking at sales in terms of money?


237
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,814 line:-1
In number of pancakes?


238
00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:03.884 line:-2 align:center
One solution could be adding
an axis label.


239
00:13:03.917 --> 00:13:08.488 line:-2 align:center
We can write "Pancakes sold"
above the vertical axis.


240
00:13:08.522 --> 00:13:11.358 line:-1 align:center
But here it's small and off to the side.


241
00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:14.094 line:-2 align:center
We want the meaning of this chart
to be obvious.


242
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:18.065 line:-2 align:center
An alternative is to contextualize
the data with a title.


243
00:13:18.098 --> 00:13:21.935 line:-2 align:center
By using "Pancakes sold"
as a heading for the chart,


244
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,606 line:-1
the chart's meaning is front and center.


245
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,610 line:-2
Providing this context is important
for framing the chart.


246
00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:32.246 line:-2 align:center
We can make these descriptions
even better


247
00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:35.015 line:-2 align:center
by summarizing the main take-away
of the chart.


248
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,451 line:-1
A lot of charts use this approach.


249
00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:41.488 line:-2 align:center
For example, the text above
a precipitation chart in Weather


250
00:13:41.522 --> 00:13:43.290 line:-1 align:center
describes its main take-away.


251
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,027 line:-2
In this example,
it's: "Light Rain Forecastedâ€“


252
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.164 line:-2 align:center
Light rain is expected to start
in 9 minutes and last for 36 minutes"


253
00:13:52.466 --> 00:13:54.868 line:-1 align:center
There are many ways to present takeaways,


254
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:59,106 line:-2
from sentence descriptions
to glyphs comparing historical data.


255
00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:01.375 line:-2 align:center
We'll take a simple approach
for our chart.


256
00:14:01.408 --> 00:14:03.777 line:-2 align:center
Let's bring out a main take-away
for our chart


257
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.779 line:-1 align:center
by rewriting our chart title


258
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:10,951 line:-1
to say "Total Sales: 1,234 Pancakes".


259
00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:14.188 line:-2 align:center
This description grounds our chart
with a concrete value


260
00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:17.424 line:-2 align:center
and summarizes
the most critical information.


261
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,027 line:-2
Providing descriptions
that contextualize the data


262
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,131 line:-2
and summarize key take-aways
eases readers into your charts.


263
00:14:24.164 --> 00:14:27.968 line:-2 align:center
It makes a chart more approachable
and accessible for everyone.


264
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,237 line:-1
It sets up what to expect or look for,


265
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.106 line:-2 align:center
which can be especially helpful
for people with certain disabilities


266
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.577 line:-2 align:center
that make examining the details
of the chart particularly time consuming


267
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,445 line:-1
or challenging.


268
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,514 line:-1
Speaking of accessibility,


269
00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:45.419 line:-2 align:center
using audio graphs for our chart adds
important descriptions for VoiceOver.


270
00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:48.188 line:-1 align:center
With audio graphs...


271
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,890 line:-1
VoiceOver: Audio graph.


272
00:14:49.923 --> 00:14:52.059 line:-2 align:center
Lilian:
VoiceOver can non-visually describe


273
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,927 line:-1
what the axes are.


274
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:55.896 line:-1 align:center
VoiceOver: Describe chart.


275
00:14:55.929 --> 00:14:59.600 line:-1 align:center
The x-axis is time. The y-axis is sales.


276
00:14:59.633 --> 00:15:02.269 line:-1 align:center
There is one data series.


277
00:15:02.302 --> 00:15:05.272 line:-2 align:center
Lilian: Audio graphs also provide
several summaries about the data,


278
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,274 line:-1
including one you can customize.


279
00:15:07.307 --> 00:15:11.478 line:-2 align:center
These descriptions,
especially of the x and y axes,


280
00:15:11.512 --> 00:15:14.615 line:-2 align:center
are critical for non-visually
communicating the chart.


281
00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:16.683 line:-1 align:center
If audio graphs isn't an option,


282
00:15:16.717 --> 00:15:20.554 line:-2 align:center
make sure VoiceOver still has immediate
access to these types of descriptions


283
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,191 line:-2
some other way,
like through accessibility text labels.


284
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,728 line:-2
Halden: Now that we provide context,
summarized the main take-away,


285
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.931 line:-2 align:center
and use audio graphs or an equivalent
source of descriptions,


286
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:33,267 line:-1
our chart has all its essential parts.


287
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.571 line:-2 align:center
But we could make it
even more effective with interaction.


288
00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:40.541 line:-2 align:center
You can design interaction
to empower people to explore


289
00:15:40.574 --> 00:15:43.043 line:-2 align:center
and understand their data
at a deeper level.


290
00:15:43.076 --> 00:15:47.381 line:-2 align:center
For example, you can use interactions
to highlight sections of a chart


291
00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:50.851 line:-2 align:center
to explore how their data fits
in a broader context,


292
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:55,956 line:-2
or toggle between days,
weeks, months, and years.


293
00:15:55.989 --> 00:16:00.627 line:-2 align:center
We have an opportunity to enhance
our pancake sales chart with interaction.


294
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:03,430 line:-2
Our food truck owners would find it
useful to see exactly


295
00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.900 line:-2 align:center
how many pancakes were sold
on a particular day.


296
00:16:06.934 --> 00:16:09.503 line:-2 align:center
We can offer that
with an interactive tooltip,


297
00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:13.941 line:-2 align:center
which lets us touch the chart to highlight
and read these specific values.


298
00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:16.844 line:-2 align:center
To make these touch-based interactions
easy to use,


299
00:16:16.877 --> 00:16:19.546 line:-1 align:center
make sure to use large touch targets.


300
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.784 line:-2 align:center
So instead of making touch targets
on our chart the same size as our marks,


301
00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:27.521 line:-2 align:center
adding padding and stretching targets
to the full height of the chart,


302
00:16:27.554 --> 00:16:30.657 line:-2 align:center
makes it easy to use our tooltip because
you can touch any part of the chart


303
00:16:30.691 --> 00:16:33.293 line:-1 align:center
including the white space above the bars.


304
00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:38.165 line:-2 align:center
Lilian:
Interaction isn't only about touch.


305
00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:41.301 line:-2 align:center
People use a variety of other ways
to interact with devices,


306
00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:44.805 line:-2 align:center
depending on factors
like situation or disability.


307
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,774 line:-2
So you need to design
for multiple types of input


308
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:50,777 line:-2
to make chart interaction approachable
and accessible.


309
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:55.749 line:-2 align:center
In other words, for every interaction
you design for touch or mouse clicks,


310
00:16:55.782 --> 00:16:59.853 line:-2 align:center
you need to design the same experience
for inputs like keyboard,


311
00:16:59.887 --> 00:17:04.591 line:-2 align:center
Voice Control,
Switch Control, and VoiceOver.


312
00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:07.794 line:-2 align:center
As you design these interactions,
it's important to make changes


313
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,396 line:-1
on the screen visible,


314
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:11.865 line:-2 align:center
like sizing the focus indicator
for Switch Control


315
00:17:11.899 --> 00:17:13.700 line:-1 align:center
or VoiceOver to be large,


316
00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:16.703 line:-2 align:center
the same way
we designed our touch targets.


317
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:22,109 line:-2
Part of providing support for VoiceOver
is that you also need to design


318
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:25,312 line:-1
good accessibility labels.


319
00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:27.281 line:-1 align:center
Recall how when we designed our marks,


320
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:31,852 line:-2
we made sure VoiceOver can navigate
the chart's data values.


321
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:35,556 line:-2
We made it so that when VoiceOver
navigates onto one of the bars,


322
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:40,661 line:0
it reads out values like
"June 1, 36 pancakes".


323
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:44,598 align:center
Let's examine what makes this label
a good design.


324
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,233 line:0
It's succinct.


325
00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:51.505 line:-2 align:center
We don't repeat unnecessary information,
like the axis names "Time" or "Sales"


326
00:17:51.538 --> 00:17:54.875 line:-1 align:center
which audio graphs already describes.


327
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,512 line:-2
We spell out entire words
instead of using abbreviations.


328
00:17:58.545 --> 00:18:04.151 line:-2 align:center
That way, VoiceOver reads out
"June" instead of "Jun" or 6-dash-1,


329
00:18:04.184 --> 00:18:08.455 line:-2 align:center
and we make it clear
that 36 is the number of pancakes.


330
00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:11.558 line:-2 align:center
We also order the contextualizing
data value,


331
00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:14.828 line:-2 align:center
in this case, the date,
to come first.


332
00:18:14.862 --> 00:18:19.466 line:-2 align:center
This ordering makes it easier
to quickly look for a specific value.


333
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:23,136 line:-2
VoiceOver: May 27th.
May 28.


334
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.907 line:-2 align:center
May 29.
May 30th, 41 pancakes.


335
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.543 line:-2 align:center
Lilian: It also makes the data
easier to interpret,


336
00:18:29.576 --> 00:18:32.412 line:-2 align:center
especially since you can jump
to different parts of the chart


337
00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:35.782 line:-2 align:center
and getting the context first
lets you know where you are.


338
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:42,856 line:-2
The kind of labels you design
depend a lot on the goals of the chart.


339
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:47.661 line:-2 align:center
For example, the charts on elevation
changes in cycling routes from Maps


340
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:49,663 line:-1
don't show individual values,


341
00:18:49.696 --> 00:18:52.633 line:-2 align:center
but a route's pattern of elevation
gains and losses,


342
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:57,571 line:-2
and use many vertical barsâ€“
too many to navigate over individually.


343
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:03,710 line:-2
A well-designed accessibility label
could then label a section of bars with:


344
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:07,014 line:0
"From 3.6 miles to 4.4 miles:


345
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:11,118 line:0
Climb 100 feet, descend 5 feet".


346
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,988 line:-2
In contrast, if a chart is a tiny preview
inside a button


347
00:19:15.022 --> 00:19:17.424 line:-1 align:center
for opening the same chart in more detail,


348
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:20,327 line:-2
it might make sense
to summarize the entire button,


349
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,764 line:-1
chart and all, with one label.


350
00:19:23.797 --> 00:19:27.835 line:-2 align:center
Now that we've designed our interactions
to serve the focus, approachability,


351
00:19:27.868 --> 00:19:29.670 line:-1 align:center
and accessibility of our chart,


352
00:19:29.703 --> 00:19:32.439 line:-2 align:center
there's one more topic
we'd like to talk about.


353
00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:33.874 line:-1 align:center
Halden: Color.


354
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:37,411 line:-2
Color can add personality
and enhance clarity in a chart.


355
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,547 line:-2
So far, we've been designing
in black and white.


356
00:19:40.581 --> 00:19:43.417 line:-2 align:center
Color can give our chart
more pop in our app.


357
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.453 line:-1 align:center
But it can also convey so much more.


358
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:48,922 line:-2
You can use color
to distinguish categories,


359
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:52,259 line:-2
as with the three activity rings
in the Fitness app.


360
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,895 line:-2
You can also use it
to communicate intensity,


361
00:19:54.928 --> 00:19:57.764 line:-1 align:center
such as heat in a weather forecast.


362
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:01,401 line:-2
You can even remove color
to draw attention to features of a chart.


363
00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:03.370 line:-1 align:center
Here the health app does so


364
00:20:03.403 --> 00:20:06.673 line:-2 align:center
to highlight your minimum and maximum
heart rate within a day.


365
00:20:08.175 --> 00:20:10.677 line:-1 align:center
Consider using color to enhance.


366
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,381 line:-2
You ideally use color as an addition
to make the chart easier to understand


367
00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:18.485 line:-2 align:center
and not the only means
to convey critical information.


368
00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:23.390 line:-2 align:center
To help explain, let's use a scenario
of tracking two food trucks in our app:


369
00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:27.427 line:-2 align:center
one in San Francisco
and the other in Cupertino.


370
00:20:27.461 --> 00:20:30.697 line:-2 align:center
We want to modify our total sales chart
to allow us to compare sales


371
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,366 line:-1
in these two locations.


372
00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.034 line:-1 align:center
How do we do this?


373
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,370 line:-1
We could use a line for each city's sales,


374
00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:39.006 line:-2 align:center
but we can't tell which line
belongs to which city.


375
00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:42.142 line:-1 align:center
No label or layout distinguishes the two.


376
00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:45.846 line:-2 align:center
We can clarify the association
by placing a symbols on each line


377
00:20:45.879 --> 00:20:48.248 line:-1 align:center
to mark individual days.


378
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:52,152 line:-2
Here we use circles for San Francisco
and squares for Cupertino.


379
00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:54.855 line:-1 align:center
Notice that we need a legend now.


380
00:20:54.888 --> 00:20:57.491 line:-2 align:center
We can add color
to enhance this difference.


381
00:20:57.524 --> 00:21:00.894 line:-2 align:center
It's important that color is added
on top of the symbols here.


382
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:05,299 line:-2
Some people with colorblindness may not be
able to distinguish the lines otherwise.


383
00:21:05.332 --> 00:21:07.968 line:-2 align:center
This practice is especially important
for system settings


384
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:10,971 line:-1
like Differentiate Without Color.


385
00:21:11.004 --> 00:21:13.273 line:-1 align:center
When choosing colors to represent data,


386
00:21:13.307 --> 00:21:15.475 line:-1 align:center
there are a few things to consider.


387
00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:19.046 line:-2 align:center
First,
consider how color can carry meaning.


388
00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:23.617 line:-2 align:center
For example, red and green
for low versus charged battery levels.


389
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.854 line:-2 align:center
Culture can inform
the meanings of colors too.


390
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,990 line:-2
In the US,
it makes sense to color code Stocks


391
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:33,961 line:-1
with green for gains and red for losses.


392
00:21:33.994 --> 00:21:37.598 line:-2 align:center
In some countries like China, however,
people expect the opposite,


393
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,934 line:-2
with red indicating gains
and green indicating losses.


394
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,340 line:-2
For our chart,
system blue and green work well.


395
00:21:46.373 --> 00:21:50.677 line:-2 align:center
There is no obvious meaning tied to
these colors in the context of cities.


396
00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:52.813 line:-2 align:center
But what if we wanted to customize
the colors


397
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:55,115 line:-1
to match the look and feel of our app?


398
00:21:57.084 --> 00:22:00.754 line:-2 align:center
When choosing colors for categories,
balance visual weight.


399
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:05,659 line:-2
If one color overpowers the other,
a hierarchy can be implied.


400
00:22:05.692 --> 00:22:08.328 line:-2 align:center
Say we started with a deep purple
for San Francisco


401
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:11,365 line:-1
and this vibrant pink for Cupertino.


402
00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:15.269 line:-2 align:center
Notice how in this case
the prominence of Cupertino's pink


403
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:18,272 line:-2
compared to the darkness
of San Francisco's purple


404
00:22:18.305 --> 00:22:20.974 line:-1 align:center
makes Cupertino look more important.


405
00:22:21.008 --> 00:22:25.913 line:-2 align:center
We can fix that by evening out
the saturation and luminosity.


406
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:26,980 line:-1
That's better.


407
00:22:27.014 --> 00:22:29.216 line:-2 align:center
And while these color choices
still need some work,


408
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:32,586 line:-2
now they have equal weight
and don't suggest one city as primary


409
00:22:32.619 --> 00:22:35.122 line:-1 align:center
and the other, secondary.


410
00:22:35.155 --> 00:22:39.359 line:-2 align:center
Note that adjusting color
for visual weight is a tool.


411
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:42,062 line:-2
Sometimes it's useful to use a color
with more visual weight


412
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:46,366 line:-2
when we want to draw attention
to specific values or sections in a chart.


413
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,802 line:-2
Trend charts in the Fitness app
use this strategy


414
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:51,104 line:-1
to highlight your recent activity.


415
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:53,540 line:-2
When choosing a palette,
it's also important to choose


416
00:22:53.574 --> 00:22:58.212 line:-2 align:center
visually distinct colors
to improve accessibility and readability.


417
00:22:58,245 --> 00:23:01,682 line:-2
A good rule is to pick colors
that are easy to differentiate by name


418
00:23:01.715 --> 00:23:03.884 line:-1 align:center
and contrast well from each other.


419
00:23:03.917 --> 00:23:08.355 line:-2 align:center
So instead of purple for San Francisco
and purpley-pink for Cupertino,


420
00:23:08.388 --> 00:23:11.258 line:-1 align:center
let's use purple and green.


421
00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:13.727 line:-2 align:center
Let's also make sure
they're not just distinct from each other,


422
00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.863 line:-1 align:center
but also from the background.


423
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,765 line:-2
Ensuring that colors have high contrast
both from each other


424
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,435 line:-2
and the rest of the chart
makes the chart more accessible


425
00:23:21.468 --> 00:23:26.507 line:-2 align:center
for people with visual impairments and
is a better overall design for everyone.


426
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:31.278 line:-2 align:center
Remember to also try making your colors
distinct for people with color blindness.


427
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:35,215 line:-2
You can check your choices
with color blindness filters.


428
00:23:35.249 --> 00:23:39.620 line:-2 align:center
Finally, make sure your chart respects
system settings by designing colors


429
00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:42,022 line:-2
to adapt for both Dark Mode
and Light Mode,


430
00:23:42.055 --> 00:23:44.424 line:-1 align:center
as well as Increase Contrast.


431
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,494 line:-2
All right, let's recap.
What did we do today?


432
00:23:47.528 --> 00:23:51.365 line:-2 align:center
Lilian: Well, we designed a chart
for our pancake food truck app.


433
00:23:51.398 --> 00:23:55.369 line:-2 align:center
To do so, we chose marks that most
effectively communicate our goal,


434
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:57,171 line:-1
and represented them in VoiceOver,


435
00:23:57.204 --> 00:24:01.508 line:-2 align:center
set our axis range and gridlines
to better communicate values at a glance,


436
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:06,180 line:-2
added descriptions to ease people in
with context and overviews,


437
00:24:06.213 --> 00:24:09.850 line:-2 align:center
incorporated interaction
to offer details on demand,


438
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:13,954 line:-2
added a splash of color as the butter
on top of our pancake chart,


439
00:24:13.987 --> 00:24:16.924 line:-2 align:center
and further used color to enhance
our second chart


440
00:24:16.957 --> 00:24:21.228 line:-2 align:center
for comparing how our pancake sales
between cities stack up.


441
00:24:21.261 --> 00:24:22.863 line:-1 align:center
At every step of the way,


442
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:26,834 line:-2
we made design decisions to ensure
that our chart was focused,


443
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:29,570 line:-1
approachable, and accessibleâ€“


444
00:24:29.603 --> 00:24:33.607 line:-2 align:center
in other words,
that we made an effective chart.


445
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,475 line:-2
Halden:
Remember, the chart we designed


446
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:39,179 line:-2
is part of an entire system of charts
within the rich context of an app.


447
00:24:39.213 --> 00:24:42.449 line:-2 align:center
You can use the same design process
to make these other charts on pancakes


448
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,885 line:-1
flippin' fantastic.


449
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,854 line:-1
Now I want some pancakes.


450
00:24:46.887 --> 00:24:49.256 line:-1 align:center
Lilian: Yeah, me too.


451
00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:53.894 line:-1 align:center
Halden: Thanks for watching.
