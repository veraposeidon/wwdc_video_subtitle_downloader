00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,266 line:0
These concepts run
through the Focus Noodles app.


159
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,069 line:0
A user can get
into the headspace


160
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,006 position:50%
of covering their phones
and start to focus.


161
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,574 line:0
- If you love something,


162
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,944 position:50%
you always find
a way to learn better.


163
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,913 position:50%
And I want people
to love learning Chinese,


164
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,549 position:50%
and I want to make it
more playful, more fun,


165
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,484 line:0
and people will enjoy learning.


166
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,819 position:50%
- People see this as a game.


167
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,187 line:0
We can be
a lot more intentional


168
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:38,258 line:0
to create a game using our
technology to track your body.


169
00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:40.760 line:-1 position:50%
Get you to move
your arms, move your body,


170
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,462 line:-1
and basically get you
into the rhythm


171
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,497 line:-1
and usually the game
is always like this.


172
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,032 line:-1
That's where we took
the inspiration


173
00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:48.034 line:-1 position:50%
to create Active Arcade.


174
00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.235 line:-1 position:50%
Just like choreography;


175
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,037 line:-1
just like teaching you
how to dance.


176
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,707 line:0
- We were in the middle
of quite a long project.


177
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,542 position:50%
We realized it would be
really good fun


178
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,978 position:50%
to just do a really fast project


179
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,647 position:50%
and we could never
lose motivation for it.


180
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,117 line:0
- So the concept of the game
is you've murdered your husband,


181
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:08,421 position:50%
and your goal is to make sure
other people don't find out.


182
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,222 line:0
[LAUGHS]


183
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,725 line:0
- The character
of Rebel Girls app


184
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:17,163 line:0
is like your feminist aunt
who is very kind


185
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,065 line:0
and who's full of stories.


186
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:23,737 line:0
And her goal is to make sure
that some of the best values


187
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,138 line:0
are instilled in you.


188
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,007 position:50%
Empowering girls to become


189
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,877 line:0
the most confident
generation of girls.


190
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,481 line:0
- It's an app that is really
the friend you wish you had


191
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,849 position:50%
when you lose a loved one.


192
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,283 position:50%
It's the smart checklist


193
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,252 line:0
to telling you all the things
you need to do,


194
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,253 line:0
but at the same time,


195
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,022 position:50%
only the things
you need to do right now


196
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,625 position:50%
and what can wait, but also
allowing us to do it for you.


197
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,726 line:0
- For Behind the Frame,


198
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,696 position:50%
it's basically
an escape room game.


199
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:54,834 position:50%
Has that Ghibli kind of feel
to feel like playable anime.


200
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,171 position:50%
We look at
the color scheme of Ghibli


201
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,440 position:50%
and also Renaissance paintings.


202
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,545 position:50%
- The idea behind Townscaper is
you just build beautiful houses.


203
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,213 line:0
That's all there is to it.


204
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,115 position:50%
- The whole concept
is that you're finally


205
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,084 position:50%
able to touch the artwork,


206
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,020 position:50%
something that you're not
able to do in real life.


207
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,689 size:2% position:90% align:right
♪


208
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,192 line:0
- One of the biggest challenges
of designing tools


209
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,761 line:0
for creative people is that
a lot of the tasks


210
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,197 line:0
that artists want to create,
they're quite complex tasks.


211
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,866 line:0
So the challenge is
how do we take all that power


212
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,836 line:0
and make it really
usable and simple?


213
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:33,072 line:0
- It has to be easy for someone
who's jumping straight in


214
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,041 line:0
and hasn't really done
this kind of work before,


215
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,478 position:50%
but it also has to be effortless
for professionals as well.


216
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,614 position:50%
Making something simple
is quite complex.


217
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:45,185 position:50%
- There are so many tiny details


218
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,688 line:0
that go into creating
an experience.


219
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,324 position:50%
There was no way for it not
to feel really clunky.


220
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,460 line:0
The next four and a half years
of development


221
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,062 position:50%
was a lot of kind of
stripping those things away.


222
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,399 line:0
And how do we get rid of the
things that might otherwise


223
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,768 line:0
distract people so that
they can actually focus


224
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,171 position:50%
on this moment
that we're trying to create?


225
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,873 line:0
- It was incredibly hard.


226
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,842 position:50%
Graphic design,
as we know it,


227
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,411 line:0
is kind of coming from
the desktop-world era,


228
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:15,615 position:50%
and didn't really have a lot of
innovation in the last decades.


229
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,785 line:0
- I'd approached it similarly
to designing a building --


230
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,554 position:50%
both you need
to navigate through.


231
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,922 line:-1
With a website,
or even with an app,


232
00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:24.491 line:-1 position:50%
you have different views.


233
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,425 line:-1
You have an entrance.


234
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,860 line:-1
At a certain point
you have an exit;


235
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,361 line:-1
you have different rooms,


236
00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:30.430 line:-1 position:50%
and the experience
needs to be good.


237
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,900 position:50%
- My watercolor skills
are horrible.


238
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.770 line:-1 position:50%
My code development
is at the HTML levels.


239
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.874 line:-1 position:50%
So I also need to convince other
people, through my journey,


240
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,876 line:-1
to build these things with me.


241
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:47,113 line:-1
When we put it out, there was no
other watercolor game like it


242
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,681 line:-1
or even watercolor app.


243
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,083 line:-1
So I really worked heavily


244
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,784 line:-1
with getting in
all the small details,


245
00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:53.286 line:-1 position:50%
getting the water
to flow correctly


246
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,289 line:-1
and getting it to just feel
really nice.


247
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,458 position:50%
- Pushing the limits
has never been the problem.


248
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,693 line:0
The whole team loves to do that,


249
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,695 line:0
loves to see how far
they can take a character


250
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,798 position:50%
or how much story
we can get into this scene.


251
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,233 line:0
The challenge
is to keep limits on that


252
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,835 position:50%
so we can actually get it done.


253
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,638 line:0
- If you can create something
that people cannot see


254
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,807 line:0
in the real life, then sometimes
they will feel "wow"


255
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,478 position:50%
at that moment
and we will feel so satisfied.


256
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,779 position:50%
[LAUGHS]


257
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,550 line:0
Yeah, so this is why
we choose optical illusions.


258
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,319 line:0
For most people, when you see
some optical illusion,


259
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,787 line:0
you are just wowed.


260
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,390 position:50%
- It was quite
a tricky problem to solve


261
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,659 line:0
of just making sure that
you could be playing on a bus,


262
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,794 line:0
but you don't notice
that you're on the bus anymore.


263
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,597 position:50%
It's all of the little things
that build up the immersion,


264
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,065 line:0
not the big, obvious ones.


265
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,669 position:50%
So the scuttling noises,
steam vents, things like that.


266
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,371 position:50%
- We had huge geometries
and landscapes


267
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,007 position:50%
and things that we wanted
to make really quick and custom.


268
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,510 position:50%
We would just use our tool
that we designed,


269
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,446 position:50%
and it would automatically
Lego-ify it.


270
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:57,116 position:50%
- Our goal was to design
a very focused experience


271
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,252 position:50%
for touch devices.


272
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,920 line:0
The player can interact
with this world


273
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,223 position:50%
without having to think about.


274
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,058 line:0
That might sound simple,


275
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,927 position:50%
but it's actually one of
the hardest things to pull off.


276
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:12,899 line:0
- Marvel Future Revolution
is an open-world, superhero,


277
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,135 position:50%
action MMO RPG on mobile.


278
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,239 line:-1
So it's got all your favorite
Marvel superheroes


279
00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:22.976 line:-1 position:50%
saving the world with all
your buddies and friends.


280
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,477 line:-1
The fact that
you could actually have


281
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,879 line:-1
the true superhero experience


282
00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:29.449 line:-1 position:50%
and you could actually take it
everywhere with you.


283
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,851 line:0
- I think that from
the very beginning we knew


284
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,653 line:0
we wanted to make a game


285
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,457 line:0
that was a mix
between music and story.


286
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,727 line:0
I mean, everything is in
the name of the game, you know.


287
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:44,263 position:50%
So there's this character,
Gabrielle, who's in a coma.


288
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,934 line:0
You have to play music
to unlock memories.


289
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,371 line:0
To make this whole game,
it was a gigantic process,


290
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,907 line:0
but I mean,
it was a fantastic one.


291
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,542 line:0
- I thought,
"Cameras are so delightful;


292
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,146 position:50%
maybe we can bring, like,
a semblance of that delight


293
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,015 position:50%
to an iPhone camera."


294
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,517 line:0
I get emails every month --
every week, sometimes --


295
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,386 line:0
of people saying, like,
"I really enjoyed that.


296
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,553 line:0
It really helped a lot."


297
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,922 line:0
And that's so cool.
[LAUGHS]


298
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,992 line:0
- This app that we had created
actually convinced people


299
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,228 line:0
to get rid of their vehicle


300
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,030 position:50%
and made riding
public transit fun.


301
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,097 line:0
And from that point on,


302
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,333 position:50%
I think the motivation
became that transit


303
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:23,236 position:50%
can have an impact on
people's transportation choices.


304
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,739 position:50%
- Mental health was one
of those glowing beacons of need


305
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:31,210 line:0
where the skillset of a designer
and a product thinker


306
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,881 line:0
are deeply needed,
directing a lot of our attention


307
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:39,018 line:0
toward traditionally
underrepresented populations


308
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,921 position:50%
and showing up in a way that,
we like to say,


309
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:46,092 position:50%
opens a front door to care.


310
00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:49.362 line:-1 position:50%
- Apps and games
have to tackle social change.


311
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,764 line:-1
- An inclusive game
or app is something


312
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,033 line:-1
that everyone feels at home.


313
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,535 line:-1
Everyone can...


314
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,337 line:-1
- ...have fun,
yet still connect with people.


315
00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:01.107 line:-1 position:50%
- That authenticity allows us
not to just have


316
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:04,644 line:-1
kind of symbolic diversity,
but actual diversity.


317
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,647 line:-1
- I think if we want
to see social change,


318
00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:10.683 line:-1 position:50%
then we need to exhibit it,
especially in entertainment


319
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,287 line:-1
because it shows people
where we can go.


320
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,122 line:-1
- I think I really
started to think,


321
00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:18.524 line:-1 position:50%
"Hey, I can now make things
that help people


322
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,160 line:-1
and solve the world
a little bit."


323
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,863 line:-1
- I think over the last
two years, especially,


324
00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.998 line:-1 position:50%
like, we're seeing
where we're going,


325
00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:28.267 line:-1 position:50%
where we're going to spend more
and more of our lives digitally


326
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,769 line:-1
in this world.


327
00:14:29.769 --> 00:14:37.810 line:-1 position:50%
And how do we, as people, shape
those everyday experiences?


328
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,513 line:-1
- A tip I could give
to the young developers


329
00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:44.083 line:-1 position:50%
is stick to your original idea.


330
00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:45.685 line:-1 position:50%
- If you're only
getting inspiration


331
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,187 line:-1
from all the other games
that you love,


332
00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:50.223 line:-1 position:50%
it's just going to be
another game.


333
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:54,093 line:-1
- Try, fail, and try again.
And fail. And try again.


334
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,863 line:-1
- Make as much as you can.


335
00:14:56.863 --> 00:14:58.164 line:-1 position:50%
They don't have to be huge.


336
00:14:58.164 --> 00:15:00.566 line:-1 position:50%
They don't have to be exciting.


337
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,702 line:-1
But the more you make,
the more you learn how to make.


338
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,072 line:-1
- When to leave it alone
and stop tinkering on it.


339
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,673 line:-1
- Really figure out
what the game is


340
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,842 line:-1
before bringing people on.


341
00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:11.077 line:-1 position:50%
- Don't get frustrated.


342
00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:13.112 line:-1 position:50%
- Let go of some
of your assumptions.


343
00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:14.580 line:-1 position:50%
- Trying to decide what
the market wants


344
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,915 line:-1
doesn't really make sense.


345
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.917 line:-1 position:50%
It's like, do something that
you're going to be motivated


346
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:18.785 line:-1 position:50%
to keep working on,


347
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,154 line:-1
that you actually want
to exist in the world.


348
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:24,290 line:-1
- You can steal,
but steal from the best


349
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.594 line:-1 position:50%
and always add your own
kind of magic fairy dust.


350
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,495 line:-1
- Get inspired.


351
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,831 line:-1
Get inspired by what's out there
and what's adjacent.


352
00:15:31.831 --> 00:15:33.299 line:-1 position:50%
And look at what techniques
are in there


353
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,802 line:-1
and how you can approach it
from a totally fresh start


354
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:40,606 line:-1
with the things
and the biases that you have.


355
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:47,480 line:-1
- The Apple Design Award,
it is like the Oscar. [LAUGHS]


356
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.250 line:-1 position:50%
- I couldn't believe it.
I was like, in tears, basically.


357
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,520 line:-1
- I didn't know who I can tell.
It's like, oh my God.


358
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,990 line:-1
I think something --
the most amazing thing happened


359
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,494 line:-1
and there was no one in the room
I could share it with.


360
00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:04.964 line:-1 position:50%
- I remember seeing
some tears in his eyes.


361
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,567 line:-1
It means a lot to me as well,


362
00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:11.003 line:-1 position:50%
because I was the one
that asked him to quit his job.


363
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,539 line:-1
- Are they still asleep?
I mean, come on.


364
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:17,844 line:-1
It's the Apple Design Awards
happening over here.


365
00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:21.447 line:-1 position:50%
- Very first reaction
when I received the email.


366
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,616 line:-1
OK, it's probably a spam.


367
00:16:23.616 --> 00:16:27.420 line:-1 position:50%
Then I was like, hmm,
it's a good spam.


368
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,022 line:-1
And then I started
talking about it with the team,


369
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:34,493 line:-1
and, like, everyone was like,
"What?!" [LAUGHS]


370
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,363 line:-1
- Well, what would I want to say
to my fellow finalists?


371
00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:38.731 line:-1 position:50%
Best of luck.


372
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,067 line:-1
You've built something
that's amazing,


373
00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:43.202 line:-1 position:50%
whether it gets an award or not.


374
00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:48.608 line:-1 position:50%
- And now we become the
Apple Design Awards finalists.


375
00:16:48.608 --> 00:16:53.045 line:-1 position:50%
It's like every day I'm in
the highest point in my life.


376
00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:55.348 line:-1 position:50%
- We made it!
[LAUGHS]


377
00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:57.250 line:-1 position:50%
- I remember the moment
when I first heard it,


378
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,784 line:-1
it was quite emotional for me.


379
00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:02.488 line:-1 position:50%
So I hope they're also looking
back at their progress


380
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,258 line:-1
and their work
over the last year or more.


381
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,026 line:-1
- Great job and congratulations.


382
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,227 line:-1
- Congratulations to everybody.


383
00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:09.362 line:-1 position:50%
- Congratulations.


384
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,529 line:-1
- Congratulations!


385
00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:12.331 line:-1 position:50%
- It's an honor
to be amongst you.


386
00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:13.766 line:-1 position:50%
- Great job.


387
00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.635 line:-1 position:50%
And let's keep on building it.


388
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:20,773 line:-1
- Your continuous work
and creation and your effort


389
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,276 line:-1
will make a difference.
